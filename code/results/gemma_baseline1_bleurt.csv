3153,"We weren't long distance until he joined the military.  I love him and I know he loves, me but it's complicated. He said he's not going to find someone else, but I'm afraid. How do I keep our relationship going?","You're wise to be aware of possible changes to your relationship once your bf is away from you for extended time periods.All you both can do is state your intentions and wishes, keep in contact as much as possible, and wait to see how your relationship unfolds.To a large degree, each of you is relying on faith that if the relationship is meant to last for a while, then it will.   The military may add stress.This doesn't necessarily mean the stress will dissolve the relationship.Sometimes all anyone is able to do, is try.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it’s completely understandable that you're feeling afraid and anxious. It sounds like you're in a vulnerable place, and it’s great that you're recognizing these feelings and wanting to work on things. Let's break this down and explore some ways to navigate this.

**1. Acknowledge and Validate Your Feelings:**

* **It's Okay to Be Afraid:** Your fear is completely valid. Long-distance relationships are incredibly challenging, and the uncertainty you're feeling is a natural response. Don’t try to suppress it. Acknowledge it: ""I'm feeling afraid because this is difficult, and I want to protect what we have.""
* **Don’t Minimize Your Feelings:** Don’t let him tell you to just ""get over it."" Your feelings are real and deserve to be addressed.

**2. Understanding His Perspective (and Asking Questions):**

* **Dig Deeper into ""Not Going to Find Someone Else"":** He said he won’t find someone else, but *why*?  It’s important to understand the depth of that statement. Is it based on a genuine, profound connection, or is it more of a statement of commitment without a fully articulated understanding of the challenges? Gently ask him to elaborate: ""When you say you won't find someone else, what does that really mean to you? What makes you so sure?""
* **Ask About His Needs:** Long-distance relationships require a lot of intentionality.  Ask him what *he* needs to feel secure and connected during this time.  Does he need more frequent communication?  Specific activities you can do together virtually?
* **Talk About His Attachment Style:**  Understanding his attachment style (secure, anxious, avoidant, disorganized) can shed light on his behavior.  (You can find resources on attachment theory online – it’s a helpful framework).

**3. Strengthening Your Connection – Intentionality is Key:**

* **Increase Quality Time (Even Virtually):** Long-distance doesn’t have to mean a lack of connection. Schedule regular video calls, even if it's just for 30 minutes. Plan virtual activities – watch a movie together, play an online game, cook the same meal and eat together virtually.
* **Share Your Day-to-Day:**  Don't just talk about big things. Share the small, mundane details of your lives. This helps him feel like he's still a part of your world.
* **Express Appreciation Regularly:**  Tell him what you appreciate about him, both big and small.  ""I really appreciate you taking the time to call me tonight,"" or “I love how you always make me laugh.”
* **Create Shared Rituals:** Develop rituals that you can do together, even if they're simple – like a nightly check-in, a virtual ""date night,"" or a shared playlist.
* **Be Vulnerable:**  Share your fears, insecurities, and dreams with him.  Mutual vulnerability builds trust and intimacy.

**4. Addressing Your Fears – Communication is Crucial:**

* **Talk About Your Fears Directly:** Don't bottle up your anxieties. Say something like, ""I'm feeling insecure because of the distance, and I'm worried about us drifting apart. Can we talk about how we can prevent that?""
* **Establish Boundaries:**  It's okay to have boundaries around communication – for example, agreeing on a maximum time you'll spend on calls or a timeframe for when you’ll discuss certain topics.
* **Discuss Expectations:** Have a frank conversation about your expectations for the relationship – how often you’ll communicate, how you’ll handle disagreements, and what you both need to feel fulfilled.

**5. Self-Care – Don't Neglect Yourself:**

* **Maintain Your Own Life:** It’s crucial to have your own interests, hobbies, and social connections. This will make you a more interesting and well-rounded partner and will prevent you from becoming overly dependent on him.
* **Practice Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself. Long-distance relationships are hard, and there will be times when things feel difficult.

**Important Note:**  His statement about not finding someone else is a good start, but it’s not a guarantee. It’s his commitment, but *your* feelings and actions are equally important.

315,"I have no real friends. I have a girlfriend who irritates me but loves me to death. I push her away and pushes me away. We’re going through a breakup, and I have nobody.","Having time all to yourself may be necessary so you have time to reflect on your own identity and values, become more clear on what matters most to you, and with this increased self-understanding, be able to attract people who will feel like satisfying friends.Having a relationship with someone whom you push away and are pushed away, with someone who is irritating, seems to have limited benefit for each of you.Maybe you are together from fear of being alone, and being alone is exactly what you may now need in your life in order to draw more favorable people to you.","Okay, this sounds incredibly tough, and it’s brave of you to reach out and acknowledge how you're feeling. It's completely understandable that you're struggling – a breakup, particularly one marked by pushing each other away, coupled with a lack of genuine connection, is a heavy combination. Let's break this down and explore some things.

**1. Validating Your Feelings:**

* **It's Okay to Feel This Way:** Seriously, it’s okay to feel lost, sad, frustrated, angry, and even a little numb. You’ve been through a significant loss, and it's a normal reaction. Don't beat yourself up for feeling this way.
* **The Push/Pull Dynamic:** You've identified a key issue: the push/pull dynamic with your girlfriend. This is incredibly common in relationships, especially when there's underlying insecurity, fear of vulnerability, or unresolved conflict. It's exhausting and damaging, and it makes building a real connection nearly impossible.
* **The Lack of Friends:** Having no real friends to lean on amplifies the pain. It’s like adding fuel to the fire.

**2. Understanding the Breakup:**

* **Don’t Dwell on Blame:** While it’s natural to analyze what went wrong, focusing solely on blaming yourself or your girlfriend won’t help. Try to understand *why* you pushed her away. Was it fear? Insecurity? A need for space? Recognizing the root cause is the first step.
* **Acceptance:**  The breakup is over. While it’s going to hurt for a while, dwelling on ""what ifs"" won't change anything. Focus on moving forward.

**3. Addressing the Current Situation – You & Your Girlfriend:**

* **Respect Boundaries:** Even though the relationship is ending, try to maintain some level of respect for each other. Harsh words and accusations will only prolong the pain.
* **Limited Contact (Initially):**  For now, it might be best to limit contact. This gives you both space to heal and process your emotions.
* **No Contact (Potentially):** Depending on the intensity of the push/pull, a period of no contact might be necessary for *both* of you to truly move on.

**4. Building Connections - This is Crucial:**

This is where you can take control and start to rebuild. It won't happen overnight, but it's essential.

* **Start Small:** Don’t aim for a huge group of friends. Focus on one or two connections.
* **Join Groups Based on Your Interests:** This is the *best* way to meet people with shared passions. Think about what you enjoy – hiking, gaming, reading, volunteering, sports, art, music, etc.
* **Take a Class:** Learning something new is a great way to meet people.
* **Volunteer:** Helping others is rewarding and a good way to connect with like-minded individuals.
* **Reconnect with Old Acquaintances:**  Reach out to people you’ve lost touch with.
* **Be Open and Approachable:** Smile, make eye contact, and be willing to strike up conversations.
* **Initiate Contact:** Don't wait for others to reach out to you.  Send a message, invite someone for coffee, or suggest an activity.

**5. Taking Care of Yourself:**

* **Self-Care is Essential:**  Now more than ever, prioritize your well-being. This includes:
    * **Healthy Eating:** Nourish your body.
    * **Regular Exercise:**  Even a short walk can make a difference.
    * **Adequate Sleep:**  Lack of sleep can exacerbate negative emotions.
    * **Relaxation Techniques:**  Try meditation, deep breathing, or yoga.
* **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be incredibly therapeutic.
* **Hobbies:**  Engage in activities you enjoy.
* **Limit Social Media:**  It can often fuel feelings of comparison and inadequacy.

**6. Seeking Support:**

* **Talk to Someone You Trust:**  If you can, talk to a family member or trusted friend (even if it's not a ""real friend"" yet, this is a step).
* **Consider Therapy:** A therapist can provide a safe space to explore your feelings, understand your patterns, and develop coping mechanisms. This is *highly* recommended, especially given the complexity of your situation.  It can help you understand why you push people away and how to build healthier relationships.

* **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741
* **The Trevor Project:** 1-866-488-7386 (for LGBTQ youth)

2179,I feel like my time is going too fast,"Thank you for reaching out! That is a great question! As an American, I can truly say that I spend way too much time on the go! It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe! I often ask myself, what if I only had one day left on this Earth? What would I do? Well, that is an easy question. I would spend it with my family! Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World, right? Its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring.Time management is a very important factor when learning to ""live life to the fullest""! In fact, this is a required course in undergraduate college now. Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this. Personally, for myself I like to keep a calendar with a to-do list. I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list. That way, if I do not get through the list, I am not stressing over the little things. When planning your day, it is important you schedule work, eat and play. A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. There is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this, then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse/partner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there. Again, everyone has their own style on time management. I hope this was helpful for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out for anything further!","It's completely understandable to feel like time is going too fast – it's a surprisingly common experience! There are a lot of reasons why this can happen, and it's great that you're recognizing it and wanting to understand it better. Let's break down some potential reasons and what you can do about it.

**1. Why Does It Feel Like Time is Moving Faster?**

* **Increased Pace of Life:** Modern life is just *faster* than it used to be. We're constantly bombarded with information, notifications, and demands on our attention. This can create a sense of urgency and make it feel like time is slipping away.
* **Routine and Familiarity:** When you do the same things day after day, your brain doesn't have to work as hard to process them. This can make time feel like it's passing quickly because you're not fully engaging with each moment.
* **Lack of Mindfulness:** If you’re constantly thinking about the future or dwelling on the past, you're not fully present in the current moment. Mindfulness – being aware of what you're doing and feeling – can help slow down your perception of time.
* **Memory Consolidation:** When you're learning something new or experiencing a significant event, your brain is busy consolidating memories. This can make the period leading up to the event feel longer, while the event itself feels shorter.
* **Stress and Anxiety:** Stress and anxiety can actually distort your perception of time, often making it feel like it's speeding up.
* **Age:** As we get older, our brains process information more efficiently, which can contribute to a feeling that time is moving faster.
* **Dissociation:** In rare cases, feeling like time is moving fast can be a symptom of dissociation, which is a feeling of detachment from reality. (If you suspect this is the case, it's important to talk to a mental health professional).

**2. What You Can Do About It:**

* **Practice Mindfulness:** This is arguably the most effective thing you can do. Here are some ways to incorporate mindfulness into your life:
    * **Meditation:** Even just 5-10 minutes a day can make a difference. There are tons of guided meditations available on apps like Headspace, Calm, and Insight Timer.
    * **Focus on Your Senses:** When you're doing something simple like eating, take a moment to really pay attention to the taste, texture, and smell. Or when you’re walking, focus on the sensation of your feet hitting the ground.
    * **Body Scan Meditation:**  This involves systematically bringing your attention to different parts of your body, noticing any sensations you feel.
* **Slow Down Your Activities:** Consciously try to slow down. Take a deep breath before starting a task. Don't rush through your meals.
* **Engage in Activities You Enjoy:** When you're doing something you love, you’re more likely to be fully present and engaged, which can slow down your perception of time.
* **Create Rituals:** Establishing small rituals (like a morning coffee routine or a bedtime story) can ground you in the present moment.
* **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process your experiences and increase your awareness of the present.
* **Spend Time in Nature:** Studies have shown that spending time in nature can reduce stress and improve your sense of connection to the present moment.
* **Limit Multi-Tasking:**  Focus on one thing at a time.
* **Connect with Others:**  Meaningful connections with people can bring a sense of grounding and presence.


**3. Let's Talk More - I Need a Little More Information**

To help me understand your situation better and offer more tailored advice, could you tell me a little more about:

*   **When did you start feeling this way?** Is this a recent feeling, or has it been going on for a while?
*   **What's your typical day like?** (Roughly, what do you do, and how much time do you spend on each thing?)
*   **What's going on in your life right now?** (Are you experiencing any major changes, stress, or challenges?)
*   **On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being “not at all” and 10 being “extremely,” how much does this feeling of time speeding up bother you?**",0.3404027819633484
2929,"He wants to wear makeup and heels. He even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina. He wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him. I have tried this for him, but I don’t like it and have told him so. He keeps making comments about it and says he can't live without it.","It sounds like you may be asking two different questions.With regard to what you said about your husband dressing as a female in your bedroom, I wonder if you would consider asking him more about this. If you choose to do that, I would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience. This can be difficult to do at times, particularly when you may want to offer your own opinions or become very anxious or of type. Consider thinking of a phrase that may help you to stay calm during the discussion. It may be helpful to think of yourself as asking questions as if you were an investigative reporter and using questions that start with words like ""what, how, who, where, when."" Questions that start with ""why,"" can be very difficult to answer for some people and can be overwhelming because it often links to answers involving emotions that may or may not be understood. Also try restating what your husband is saying to make sure that you are understanding correctly. If what he is telling you is different than what you have heard or thought of for many years, it may be challenging to follow his meaning initially. Remember that listening to your husband does not imply agreement with what he is saying, just that you are following and looking to understand what he is experiencing. I also recommend sticking to one topic for the conversation, but this could be done with many different topics over time.You could also see if he would be willing to have a discussion where he listens like an investigative reporter to learn more about the experience that you are having.As far as what you mentioned about the sexual experience, maybe if you can discuss what it is that you don't like and/or understand what it is that he does like, you could see if there is some middle ground here. It depends on what you both prefer.These types of conversations can be difficult to have for some couples, at least initially. Having structured conversations, such as the ones I've described briefly above, can feel awkward initially, but the reason it can be helpful is because it can lead to further understanding in a way that decreases the chances of having an argument.Also consider seeing a therapist in your area who specializes in couples to discuss some of these ideas.","Okay, this is a really complex and potentially concerning situation, and it’s good that you’re recognizing the seriousness of it. What you’re describing involves a significant power imbalance, potentially unhealthy fixations, and a disregard for your boundaries. Let's break down the key issues and what you can do:

**1. Understanding the Dynamics:**

* **Control and Manipulation:** His insistence that he ""can't live without it"" and his comments after you've expressed your discomfort strongly suggest he's trying to exert control over you. This isn't about mutual pleasure or exploration; it’s about him getting his way, regardless of your feelings.
* **Unrealistic Expectations & Fetish:** His intense focus on a specific sexual activity and his insistence on you participating, despite your aversion, points to a very specific and potentially obsessive fetish. This isn’t a shared interest; it’s his primary focus.
* **Disregard for Boundaries:** You've clearly communicated your boundaries, and he's repeatedly ignoring them. This is a major red flag. Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect for each other's limits.
* **The Makeup & Vagina Transformation:** The elaborate makeup and tucking behavior suggests a performance aspect to his desires, which adds another layer of complexity and potentially unhealthy dynamics.

**2. What You Can Do - Prioritize Your Safety and Well-being:**

* **Reinforce Your Boundaries – Clearly and Firmly:** You need to be absolutely clear and unwavering. Don't apologize for not wanting to do something. Use direct, assertive language: ""I've told you before that I don’t enjoy anal sex, and I won’t be doing it. That’s a boundary I need you to respect."" Repeat this consistently.
* **Don’t Just Say “No” – Explain *Why*:**  While simply saying ""no"" can be brushed aside, explaining *why* can help him understand the seriousness.  ""I don't enjoy this because it makes me uncomfortable, and I value our relationship based on mutual respect for each other's desires.  This is not something I’m willing to compromise on.""
* **Limit Discussion About It:**  The more he brings it up, the more power he has over you.  Politely but firmly change the subject. ""I'm not going to discuss this further. Let’s talk about something else.""
* **Recognize This Isn’t About You:**  It's crucial to understand that his intense focus on this activity isn’t a reflection of your worth or desirability. It’s rooted in his own desires and potentially unhealthy fixations.
* **Distance Yourself Emotionally:**  Try to detach emotionally from his insistence.  Don’t get drawn into arguments or attempts to convince you otherwise.
* **Consider Ending the Relationship:** This is a difficult but potentially necessary step. His behavior is disrespectful, controlling, and potentially indicative of deeper issues.  A healthy relationship should never involve pressure, coercion, or disregard for your boundaries.

430,"I am a really shy person. I'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?","First of all, way to go in stretching yourself out of your comfort zone! You are sure to grow through all of this practice presenting to your peers, and that in itself will help to grow your confidence over time. In the meantime, do whatever you can to help yourself feel prepared for each presentation. Do your work ahead of time so that you feel well-informed on your topic, and then spend the days leading up to your presentation practicing. Do your presentation in the mirror, while you are driving (if it won't distract you from the road), and practice in front of a friend. On the day of the presentation, eat a balanced meal, get a pep talk from a supportive friend, use deep breathing to keep your body calm, and remind yourself that you are prepared. You got this!","Okay, this is a really common and understandable struggle, especially in a demanding environment like a graduate program. It's fantastic that you're recognizing this and actively seeking solutions – that’s a huge first step! Let’s break down how you can build confidence around presentations. Here's a layered approach, combining practical strategies with some mindset shifts:

**1. Understanding Your Anxiety:**

* **Identify the Root:** What *specifically* makes you anxious about presentations? Is it the fear of judgment, forgetting your material, messing up your voice, or something else?  Pinpointing the source helps you target your efforts.
* **Recognize it's Normal:**  Almost everyone feels some level of nervousness before speaking publicly.  It's a physiological response – your body is preparing for a challenge. Knowing this can take some of the pressure off.
* **Challenge Negative Thoughts:**  When you feel anxious, what thoughts are running through your head? (“I’m going to mess up,” “Everyone will think I’m stupid,” “I’ll freeze up.”)  Write these down and then actively challenge them with more realistic and positive ones. (“I’ve prepared, I know my material, I can handle a few stumbles,” “People are generally supportive and want me to succeed.”)

**2. Preparation - The Foundation of Confidence:**

* **Start Small:** Don't jump straight into presenting to a large group. Begin with:
    * **Practice Alone:** Rehearse your presentation *out loud* repeatedly. Record yourself to identify areas for improvement.
    * **Practice with a Friend/Mentor:**  Ask a trusted classmate, advisor, or professor to listen and give you feedback.
    * **Present to a Small Group:**  Present to a small, supportive group of friends or family.
* **Know Your Material Inside and Out:** The more comfortable you are with your content, the less you'll worry about forgetting something.
* **Structure is Key:** A clear, logical structure makes your presentation easier to deliver and easier for the audience to follow.  Use an outline.
* **Prepare for Questions:** Anticipate potential questions and have answers ready.  It’s okay to say, “That’s a great question, let me think about that for a moment.”

**3. Techniques to Manage Anxiety During the Presentation:**

* **Breathing Exercises:**  Practice deep, slow breathing to calm your nerves. Box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4) is particularly effective.
* **Visualization:**  Before you present, vividly imagine yourself giving a successful presentation. Focus on feeling confident and engaging with the audience.
* **Grounding Techniques:** If you feel overwhelmed, use grounding techniques to bring yourself back to the present moment. Examples:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Name 5 things you see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
* **Start Strong:** Have a very strong opening line or two prepared. This can help you gain momentum.
* **Focus on Your Message, Not Yourself:** Shift your focus from your anxiety to the value you’re delivering to the audience.


**4. Building Long-Term Confidence:**

* **Celebrate Small Wins:** Acknowledge and celebrate every step you take, no matter how small.
* **Focus on Progress, Not Perfection:**  No one expects you to be perfect.  It’s okay to make mistakes. Learn from them and move on.
* **Seek Feedback Regularly:**  Don't wait for the end of the presentation to ask for feedback.  Ask your professor or classmates for constructive criticism after each presentation.
* **Join a Public Speaking Group (Toastmasters):** This is a fantastic way to gain experience in a supportive environment.
* **Consider Therapy/Counseling:** If your anxiety is significantly impacting your life, talking to a therapist can provide you with coping strategies and address any underlying issues.

**Important Reminders:**

* **Be Kind to Yourself:** Shyness is a personality trait, not a flaw.  It takes time and effort to build confidence.
* **Consistency is Key:**  The more you practice and expose yourself to situations that make you anxious, the easier it will become.

**To help me give you even more tailored advice, could you tell me a little more about your situation?**

*   What kind of presentations are you typically giving? (e.g., research presentations, group presentations, individual presentations)

1315,"I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental.
   I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?","It is very good news that you realize the risks of smoking cigarettes while pregnant and are willing to stop.Thinking about smoking is a typical and frequent reaction to being without the substance.Be creative with what you know about yourself to distract you when this psychological urge comes up.  My suggestions are to imagine smoking if you find this would relieve the sense of wanting to smoke.Or, do the opposite and remind yourself of all the good reasons to not smoke.Also, since you're planning pregnancy then ask your partner for ideas on how to make the psychological feeling to want to smoke, feel less intense.Another suggestion is that your partner is your texting buddy to stop smoking.   With AA groups, a sponsor is always available for the alcoholic who feels distress about the urge to drink.   Having a trusted and caring person to tell about your problem helps in many situations.  Maybe it will help you to stop smoking.Good luck!","Okay, this is a really important and incredibly brave step you're taking. Recognizing that it's not just a physical craving but also a mental habit is *huge*. It’s fantastic that you're proactively seeking solutions – that’s the first step to breaking free. It's completely understandable that it’s hard, and the fact that you're noticing the mental component makes it even more manageable. Let's break down how to tackle this, focusing on both the physical and mental aspects.

**1. Understanding the Mental Component:**

* **Identify Your Triggers:** You’ve already started noticing this, which is brilliant. Start a journal specifically for your smoking urges. When you feel the urge, write down:
    * **What were you doing?** (e.g., stressed, bored, with friends, after a meal)
    * **What were you feeling?** (e.g., anxious, frustrated, lonely, relaxed)
    * **What thoughts were you having?** (e.g., “I deserve a break,” “This is the only thing that helps me relax,” “I need to unwind”)
    * **Rate the intensity of the urge** (1-10 scale).
    This will reveal patterns. Are you more likely to smoke when you're stressed at work? When you're feeling down? After certain social situations?
* **Challenge Your Thoughts:** Once you've identified your thoughts, start challenging them.  For example, if you think ""I deserve a break,"" ask yourself, ""Is smoking *really* a healthy way to relax? What are the long-term consequences?""
* **Cognitive Behavioral Techniques:** This is where a therapist can really help. Techniques like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can teach you to identify and change negative thought patterns.

**2. Immediate Strategies to Manage Urges:**

* **The 5-Minute Rule:** Tell yourself you'll wait just 5 minutes before having a cigarette. Often, the intensity of the urge will subside. Repeat this as needed.
* **Distraction Techniques:** When an urge hits, do *something* else immediately:
    * **Physical Activity:** Even a short walk can make a big difference.
    * **Hydrate:** Drink a glass of water.
    * **Engage Your Senses:** Listen to music, take a shower, light a scented candle, chew gum or hard candy.
    * **Talk to Someone:** Call a friend, family member, or support group.
* **Visualization:**  Visualize yourself successfully resisting the urge. Imagine yourself feeling proud and strong.
* **Deep Breathing:** Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system.

**3. Building a Supportive Environment:**

* **Tell People You Trust:** Let your family and friends know you’re quitting and ask for their support.  Having people to lean on is crucial.
* **Join a Support Group:**  Being around others who understand what you’re going through can be incredibly motivating. Look for local support groups or online communities.
* **Consider Therapy:** A therapist specializing in addiction or behavioral change can provide personalized support and strategies.
* **Remove Triggers:** Get rid of all cigarettes, lighters, ashtrays, and anything else associated with smoking from your home and car.

**4. Long-Term Strategies:**

1164,"I found the guy I’m dating on dating websites. He was telling women that they were beautiful. He said it wasn’t him and that the phone was hacked. It has since happened two other times. He says he loves me and I’m the only girl he wants to be with, but I feel he is not telling me the truth.","I would suggest possibly talking about the type of relationship that both of you want to create. For example, you may want a relationship where honesty, listening, compassion, and romanticism are major parts. You could also see what your boyfriend wants.You may also consider taking five minutes to see if he will listen to your feelings about him being on the dating site and whether he can work to learn more about what you are experiencing with asking open-ended questions (not being answered with yes or no) and restating what you are saying to see if he has it right. After that, perhaps you could switch so that you can listen to his perspective for five minutes and learn more about what he is doing by asking open-ended questions.Remember that it takes two people to have  a relationship, so the choice is yours as to whether you choose to stay in the relationship and what kind of relationship you would like to have.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling incredibly confused, hurt, and distrustful. What you're describing – someone professing love while simultaneously suggesting a hack and then repeating the same behavior – is deeply unsettling and raises serious red flags. Let's break down what's happening and what you can do:

**1. Understanding the Severity of the Situation:**

* **It’s Not Just a Mistake:** This isn't a simple misunderstanding or a momentary lapse in judgment. The repeated nature of the incidents is incredibly concerning. It suggests a pattern of behavior that goes beyond a simple mistake.
* **Lack of Accountability:** His response – claiming it wasn’t him and a hack – is a classic deflection tactic. It avoids taking responsibility for his words and actions. This demonstrates a lack of regard for your feelings.
* **Trust is Broken:** The core of any relationship is trust. These incidents have fundamentally eroded your trust in him. It's incredibly difficult to rebuild trust once it's been broken in this way.
* **Potential for Deception:** While a hack is possible, it's far more likely that he's intentionally saying these things.  The fact that it’s repeated suggests a conscious choice, not a random occurrence.

**2. Why You Feel This Way (and Why It's Valid):**

* **Intuition:** Your gut feeling is screaming at you that something isn’t right. Don’t ignore it. Your intuition is often picking up on subtle cues that your conscious mind might miss.
* **Discomfort and Anxiety:** It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious, confused, and even scared. These feelings are a natural response to feeling deceived.
* **The Value of Your Feelings:** Your feelings are valid.  You have a right to feel the way you do. Don’t let him minimize or dismiss your concerns.

**3. What You Can Do – Steps to Take:**

* **Have a Direct, Honest Conversation (Again):** You've already tried, but you need to be firm. Say something like: “I need to be completely honest with you.  The fact that this has happened multiple times, and you’ve repeatedly said it wasn't you and that it was a hack, is incredibly concerning to me. It makes me feel like you're not being honest with me, and it's damaging our relationship. I need you to understand the seriousness of this and to take full responsibility for your words and actions.”  *Don’t* get drawn into arguing about the hack. Focus on *his* behavior.
* **Set Clear Boundaries:**  ""I need you to understand that these comments are unacceptable. I will not tolerate you saying things about other women that are intended to be flattering. If it happens again, I will need to seriously reconsider our relationship.""
* **Observe His Reaction:** Pay close attention to how he responds to your concerns. Does he become defensive? Does he continue to deflect? Does he apologize sincerely and take concrete steps to ensure it doesn’t happen again? His response will tell you a lot about his character.
* **Consider a Relationship Counselor:** A therapist can help you both communicate effectively and address the underlying issues that are contributing to the problems in your relationship. They can provide a neutral space to discuss these sensitive topics.
* **Distance Yourself (If Necessary):** If he continues to dismiss your concerns, if the behavior continues, or if you simply don’t feel safe or respected, it’s okay to create distance.  Your well-being is paramount.
* **Don’t Investigate Further:** Resist the urge to stalk him online or try to uncover more information. This will likely only fuel your anxiety and could damage your relationship further.

**4. Important Considerations:**

* **You Deserve Respect:** You deserve to be with someone who is honest, respectful, and considerate of your feelings.
* **Don’t Minimize Your Feelings:** Don’t let anyone, including him, tell you that you’re overreacting.
* **Trust Yourself:** Ultimately, you need to trust your instincts.

To help me give you more tailored advice, could you tell me:

*   How long have you been dating him?
*   Can you describe his personality like? (e.g., charming, defensive, dismissive?)

1370,"After I told them, they yelled at me.","It's most important that you accept yourself and surround yourself with a group of friends who are kind to you and love you. Family hearing news of any kind for the first time if they are an anxious type of character, will always be tough to digest. Time is important to let it all settle in and also making sure you're taking good care of yourself... I think you're brave and I give you a lot of credit for not denying who you are -- you will inspire so many people to do the same in your life. Wishing you all the best. Gina","That sounds incredibly frustrating and upsetting. Being yelled at after sharing something, especially something personal or difficult, is a really painful experience. It suggests a lack of support and understanding. 

It's completely valid to feel hurt, angry, and maybe even a little scared. 

**Here are a few thoughts and things you can consider:**

* **It's not your fault:** Remember, their reaction was about *them*, not about you or what you shared. Their inability to respond with empathy or support is a reflection of their own issues.
* **You deserve respect:** Everyone deserves to be treated with respect, even when they've shared something vulnerable.
* **It's okay to feel your feelings:** Don't try to bottle up your emotions. Allow yourself to feel whatever you're feeling – sadness, anger, disappointment, etc.
* **Consider your boundaries:** Think about what you're willing to share with them in the future and how you'll respond if they react negatively again.

**What you can do now:**

* **Take care of yourself:** Do something that helps you relax and de-stress.
* **Talk to someone you trust:**  Sharing your experience with a friend, family member, or therapist can be incredibly helpful.
* **Distance yourself if needed:** If this is a pattern with this person, it might be necessary to limit your interactions with them.

506,"I’ve been on 0.5 mg of Xanax twice a day for the past month. It hasn't been helping me at all, but when I take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack, it calms me down. I was wondering how I can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking I'm abusing them. I just have very big anxiety attacks. Should I stay on the 0.5mg and deal with the attacks or should I ask to up the dose? I'm afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else.","Do you think you're abusing xanax?It is a highly addictive drug so maybe one reason you feel compelled to take more is bc you already are addicted.Drugs don't do anything helpful in solving life's problems.   Once the effect wears off, the stressful situation is once again waiting for you to address it.Think over your reason for not directly asking your psychologist about upping your dose.Also, do you ever talk about your life problems with this psychologist or only your need for drugs?    The more gradual path to a better life is to not need drugs in the first place. This consists of your willingness to face the matters that are creating such terrible feelings inside you.","Okay, this is a really important and understandable situation. It's great that you're recognizing the limitations of your current dosage and wanting to find a solution, but also understandably concerned about how your psychologist will perceive your request. Let’s break this down and figure out how to approach this conversation.

**1. Understanding Your Situation – It’s Valid to Feel This Way**

* **The Paradox:** You're experiencing a very common scenario with benzodiazepines like Xanax. They can be incredibly helpful in the short-term for acute anxiety, but relying on them consistently at a low dose can actually become ineffective over time. Your body adapts, and the drug loses its potency.
* **The 1mg Relief:** The fact that 1mg provides relief during a panic attack is crucial information. It indicates the medication *can* work, and it highlights the need to find a dose that consistently provides that benefit.
* **Fear of Discontinuation:** Your fear of being taken off medication is completely valid. Many people experience this anxiety around medication changes, and it’s important to address it openly.

**2. Addressing Your Concerns About Being Perceived as Abusing**

* **This is a common misunderstanding:**  Taking a higher dose during a panic attack isn't ""abuse."" It’s a targeted use of a medication designed to manage anxiety symptoms.  The key is to communicate this clearly to your psychologist.
* **Focus on Symptom Management:** Frame your request around managing your anxiety attacks, not about seeking a ""fix"" or wanting to be on medication constantly.

**3. How to Talk to Your Psychologist – A Strategic Approach**

Here's a suggested way to approach the conversation, broken down into steps:

* **Start by Summarizing:** “I wanted to talk about my anxiety and how I’m feeling about my current medication. I’ve been on 0.5mg twice a day for the past month, and while I appreciate the stability it provides, I’m still experiencing significant anxiety attacks. During those attacks, 1mg seems to be the dose that effectively helps me calm down.”
* **Be Honest About the Attacks:** ""These attacks are really distressing, and I want to find a way to manage them more effectively. I don't want to be constantly struggling.”
* **Express Your Concerns and Fears:** “I’m a little worried about the potential side effects of continuing at such a low dose, and I'm also a bit apprehensive about the possibility of being taken off medication entirely.  I’m concerned about the anxiety of not having something to help me during an attack.”
* **Propose a Discussion, Not a Demand:** “I’d like to discuss the possibility of increasing my dose to 1mg twice a day, and I'm open to exploring other options if that doesn't seem like the best approach.  Could we talk about what might be contributing to these attacks and how we can work together to find a sustainable solution?”
* **Ask About the Rationale:** ""Can we talk about why the current dose isn't fully effective and what factors might be influencing that?  I want to understand the reasoning behind the dosage.""

**4. Important Considerations & What to Expect**

* **Open Dialogue is Key:** Your psychologist needs to understand your experience *completely*. Don't be afraid to describe the intensity of your attacks.
* **They May Suggest Other Approaches:**  It's possible your psychologist will suggest other therapies (like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - CBT) alongside medication. This is often the most effective long-term solution.
* **Slow Dose Adjustments:**  Increasing the dose should be done gradually and under close supervision.  A sudden jump to 1mg twice a day might not be advisable.
* **Discuss Side Effects:** Be sure to discuss potential side effects (drowsiness, dependence, etc.) and strategies for managing them.

**5. Addressing Your Fear of Being Taken Off**

* **Discuss Contingency Plans:**  During the conversation, you can gently ask, “If increasing the dose isn’t effective, what are the next steps?  I’m wondering about a plan if we need to explore other options.”
* **Focus on Collaboration:**  Emphasize that you want to work *with* your psychologist to find the best solution.

2760,We've been dating for two months now. I have a heavy past that gets him angry. Does he have a right to penalize me for things I did before I met him?,"How is he penalizing you?Have you asked for his reasons for wanting to know about your heavy past?His answers may be very different than that he would like penalizing you.What you can do is explain how pressured you feel by his questions.Ideally, the two of you will become much closer by talking openly about your respective discomforts and wishes from the other.","Okay, this is a really important and complex issue, and it's great that you're recognizing it and asking for advice. Let's break this down. The short answer is **no, he doesn't have a right to penalize you for things you did before you met him.** However, the situation is nuanced, and it's understandable why you're feeling this way. Here's a more detailed explanation:

**1. Understanding His Reaction:**

* **It’s About His Feelings:** His anger isn't necessarily about *you* as a person. It's almost certainly about how his own past experiences, insecurities, or expectations are being triggered by your past. He might be projecting his own pain or fears onto your actions. He might be reacting to a perceived threat to the security and stability of his new relationship.
* **Unmet Expectations:** He likely had certain expectations about a partner coming into a relationship. Your past might be shattering those expectations, leading to feelings of betrayal, disappointment, or a fear of repeating negative patterns.
* **Control & Fear of Vulnerability:** Sometimes, anger is a defense mechanism. He might be trying to control the situation because he's afraid of being hurt again.
* **Past Trauma:** It's possible he has unresolved trauma from a previous relationship or life experience that's coloring his response.

**2. Why Penalizing You is Unacceptable:**

* **You Are Not the Same Person:** You've grown and changed in the two months you've been together. Holding you accountable for your past actions, especially when you've demonstrated growth and a commitment to a different path, is unfair and disrespectful.
* **It’s a Form of Manipulation:** Using anger as a weapon to punish you is a manipulative tactic. Healthy relationships are built on understanding, forgiveness, and support, not on holding grudges for past mistakes.
* **It's Creating an Unhealthy Dynamic:** His behavior is creating an unhealthy dynamic in the relationship. It’s creating fear and anxiety, which is not a foundation for a healthy partnership.

**3. What You Can Do:**

* **Communicate Clearly and Calmly:**  This is *crucial*.  You need to express how his behavior is making you feel. Use ""I"" statements: ""I feel hurt and unfairly judged when you express anger about something that happened before I met you. It makes it difficult for me to feel secure in our relationship.""
* **Set Boundaries:**  This is key.  You have the right to say, ""I understand you're feeling [his emotion], but I won't accept being punished for my past. I'm committed to building a healthy future with you, and holding onto the past isn't helping us do that.""  Be firm and consistent.
* **Don't Engage in Arguments About the Past:** If he keeps bringing it up, gently but firmly redirect the conversation.  ""I'm not going to rehash this. Let's talk about something positive and how we can move forward.""
* **Focus on the Present and Future:**  Steer conversations toward your relationship, your shared goals, and your feelings for each other.
* **Consider His Needs (Without Sacrificing Your Own):**  If you suspect his anger stems from deeper issues, gently encourage him to seek professional help (therapy) if he's struggling to cope. However, this is *his* responsibility, not yours.

**4. Red Flags & When to Walk Away:**

* **Constant Criticism & Guilt-Tripping:** If he consistently brings up your past and makes you feel constantly guilty or ashamed.
* **Threats of Ending the Relationship:** Using your past as a weapon to manipulate you into staying in the relationship.
* **Refusal to Move Forward:** If he refuses to acknowledge your growth or accept you for who you are today.
* **Abusive Behavior:** If his anger escalates into controlling, intimidating, or abusive behavior.

**Important Note:** You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel loved, respected, and accepted for who you are, past and present.  Don't stay in a relationship where you're constantly being punished for your history.

3337,Every winter I find myself getting sad because of the weather.  How can I fight this?,"Sometimes its quite literally the lack of sunshine that can affect our mood - in these cases it can be worth experimenting with a sun lamp, to boost your dose of vitamin D, when the sun isn't naturally out. Also consider, what is it that the change in weather, changes in your life? If for example, when its sunny you are an outdoorsy, active person and when the weather changes, you're whole activity level changes along with it, you could explore how to get some of that activity replicated indoors in the winter months.","Okay, it's incredibly common to experience seasonal sadness, often called Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) or winter blues. It's a real thing, and you're not alone in feeling this way. Let's break down how you can fight it. Here's a layered approach, combining immediate strategies with longer-term solutions:

**1. Understanding SAD & Recognizing Your Symptoms:**

* **What is SAD?** SAD is a type of depression that's linked to changes in daylight hours. Less sunlight affects brain chemicals like serotonin, which can impact mood.
* **Recognize Your Specific Symptoms:** Beyond just ""feeling sad,"" what are you *really* experiencing? Common symptoms include:
    * Persistent low mood
    * Fatigue and low energy
    * Increased appetite (especially for carbohydrates)
    * Difficulty concentrating
    * Irritability
    * Social withdrawal
    * Changes in sleep patterns (sleeping more or less)

**2. Immediate Strategies (Things You Can Do *Now*)**

* **Light Therapy:** This is often the first line of defense.
    * **Light Box:** Invest in a SAD lamp (light box). These emit bright, full-spectrum light that mimics sunlight. Use it for 20-30 minutes each morning, ideally near a window or in a room you spend time in. Look for ones that emit 10,000 lux.
    * **Brighten Your Space:** Even if you don't have a light box, maximize natural light. Open curtains, clean windows, and move furniture to take advantage of sunlight.
* **Movement & Exercise:** Even a little can help.
    * **Daily Movement:** Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days. This could be walking, dancing, yoga, swimming, or anything you enjoy.
    * **Indoor Options:** If the weather is truly awful, find ways to move indoors – a home workout video, indoor walking, or even just stretching.
* **Boost Your Mood:**
    * **Social Connection:**  Reach out to friends and family, even if you don’t feel like it.  Schedule a phone call, video chat, or (weather permitting) a socially distanced outing.
    * **Engage in Hobbies:**  Do things you enjoy – reading, crafting, listening to music, puzzles, cooking, etc.
    * **Relaxation Techniques:** Try meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or progressive muscle relaxation.
    * **Comfort Activities:**  Wrap yourself in a cozy blanket, drink a warm beverage, or take a long bath.
* **Dietary Changes:**
    * **Vitamin D:** Many people with SAD are deficient in Vitamin D, especially during winter. Talk to your doctor about getting your levels checked and potentially taking a supplement (1000-2000 IU daily is a common starting point).
    * **Nutrient-Rich Foods:** Focus on foods rich in nutrients like B vitamins, magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids.

**3. Longer-Term Strategies (Building Habits)**

* **Establish a Routine:**  Winter can disrupt your sleep schedule and daily habits.  Creating a consistent routine (wake-up time, meal times, exercise time) can provide structure and stability.
* **Plan Activities:**  Don’t just wait for the weekend.  Schedule enjoyable activities throughout the week to look forward to.
* **Mindfulness & Gratitude:**  Practicing mindfulness can help you stay present and appreciate the good things in your life, even when you're feeling down.  Keep a gratitude journal.
* **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** CBT can help you identify and change negative thought patterns that contribute to SAD.  A therapist can guide you through this process.

**4. When to Seek Professional Help**

* **If your symptoms are severe or persistent:** Don't hesitate to talk to a doctor or mental health professional.
* **If you’re experiencing:** Suicidal thoughts, significant changes in appetite or sleep, or inability to function in your daily life.
* **Talk to your doctor:** They can rule out other potential causes of your symptoms and discuss treatment options, which may include medication (antidepressants).

2130,"I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental.

I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?","Hi. Good for you in planning ahead to do what's healthiest for your baby (and yourself). That's a great first step! It's also good that you are able to identify that it's not always a physical need that's driving the addiction.For the next steps, I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological (or mental) cravings are usually based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if you're consciously trying to quit, you'll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. Well, if I'm on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually I'll give in and eat it.You're going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. That's normal and, for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. That's what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it (""Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now.""), but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.I've suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they're going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.Best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby!","Okay, this is a really important and incredibly brave step you're taking. Recognizing that it's not *just* a physical need and addressing the mental component is a huge key to success. It's fantastic that you're acknowledging this, and wanting to quit for your baby – that's a powerful motivator. Let's break down what you can do, addressing both the physical and mental aspects, and acknowledging the difficulty you're experiencing.

**1. Understanding the Mental Component:**

* **Identify Your Triggers:** You’ve already started this – you know it’s mental. Now, dig deeper. What *specifically* are you thinking about when you crave a cigarette? Is it:
    * **Stress?**  What’s causing the stress?
    * **Boredom?** Are you looking for a distraction?
    * **Habit?** Is it tied to certain activities (coffee, driving, after meals)?
    * **Emotional Feelings?** Are you using it to cope with sadness, anger, anxiety, or loneliness?
    * **Social Situations?** Do you associate smoking with certain people or places?
* **Journaling:** Start a journal specifically for cravings. Write down *exactly* what you're thinking and feeling when you have the urge. This helps you become more aware and can reveal patterns.
* **Cognitive Restructuring:** This is a technique used in therapy. When you have a craving, challenge the thoughts fueling it.  Instead of ""I *need* a cigarette,"" try “This is just a craving, and cravings pass.”  Replace negative thoughts with positive ones about your baby and your future.

**2. Strategies to Manage Cravings & Break the Cycle:**

* **The 4 D's:** This is a classic and effective technique:
    * **Delay:** Tell yourself you'll wait 10-15 minutes before having a cigarette. Often, the craving will pass.
    * **Deep Breathe:** Practice slow, deep breathing exercises. This can calm your nervous system.
    * **Drink Water:** It can help distract you and keeps you hydrated.
    * **Do Something Else:**  Engage in a distracting activity – read, listen to music, call a friend, do a puzzle, anything that takes your mind off smoking.
* **Distraction Techniques:**  These need to be things you *actually* enjoy and can do quickly.
* **Create a ""Quit Kit"":** Fill a bag with things you can reach for when cravings hit – gum, hard candies, a stress ball, a favorite book, etc.
* **Change Your Routine:** If you always smoke after dinner, change your evening routine.  Go for a walk, take a bath, or do something else.
* **Visualization:**  Visualize yourself successfully resisting a craving and feeling proud of yourself.

**3. Addressing the Underlying Mental Needs:**

* **Stress Management:** Since you mentioned stress, this is crucial. Explore healthy coping mechanisms:
    * **Mindfulness & Meditation:** Even 5-10 minutes a day can make a difference.
    * **Yoga or Tai Chi:** Combine movement with mindfulness.
    * **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** Learn to release tension in your body.
    * **Time Management:** If you're overwhelmed, break down tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
* **Talk About It:**  Don’t bottle up your feelings.  Talk to:
    * **Your Partner:**  Having a supportive partner is invaluable.
    * **A Therapist or Counselor:**  They can help you explore the root causes of your cravings and develop personalized coping strategies. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is particularly effective for addiction.
    * **Support Groups:**  Sharing your experiences with others who are going through the same thing can be incredibly helpful.
* **Self-Care:** Prioritize activities that make you feel good – spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, getting enough sleep.

**4. Support & Resources:**

* **Talk to Your Doctor:** They can prescribe medication (like nicotine replacement therapy or anti-depressants if needed) and provide guidance.
* **Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT):** Patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, and nasal sprays can help manage withdrawal symptoms.

* **Smokefree.gov:** [https://smokefree.gov/](https://smokefree.gov/) – This website offers a wealth of resources and support.

**Important Reminders:**

* **Be Kind to Yourself:**  You *will* have setbacks. Don’t beat yourself up.  Recognize it as a temporary slip, learn from it, and get back on track.
* **Celebrate Small Wins:**  Acknowledge and reward yourself for every milestone you achieve.

2725,"I'm transgender, I know I am, but I've only told a few friends. I know I can't tell my family because of previous conversations we've had. They just wouldn't accept it.
My gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own. I need some strategies for dealing with it. What should I do?","Hello, and thank you for your question. I am so glad that you reached out for help. I know that the dysphoria can feel nearly impossible to handle, especially since you have limited support from people who accept who you are. You may already know some of these resources, but I am going to share a few. 1. The website www.letsqueerthingsup.com is a blog from a very good writer that I know. His name is Sam Dylan Finch, and he is transgender. He writes about mental health, transgender issues, and many other topics. I know he has frequently written about gender dysphoria and ways to manage it. You may want to check out his site and do a search on there. 2. The website www.everydayfeminism.com employs many transgender writers and several have written about gender dysphoria and have given ideas for managing it. If you search for gender dysphoria on their site, many articles pop up. It may be a good resource for you, especially if you ever feel lonely and start to forget that there are others out there who are like you and have your back. 3. I am not sure where you live, but there are counselors who specialize in affirmative therapy, which is what is recommended for folks who are part of the LGBTQ community. So, if you decide to see a counselor about the dysphoria, try to find one that specifically says they have been trained in the affirmative approach. In addition, feel free to ask questions of the counselor before agreeing to see them for counseling. An ethical counselor would have no problem answering them before having you come in. 4. If there are some LGBTQ resource centers in your area, try to reach out to them and see if there are support groups. Gaining more support from others would be helpful. Sometimes LGBTQ-friendly counselors leave their contact information for people in resource centers. 5. Finally, I know you have not mentioned being depressed or suicidal, but I also know that it is very common for people to consider suicide when they are struggling with dysphoria, dealing with transphobia, etc. If this ever happens to you, please call 911 or the Trans Lifeline. It's free at 877-565-8860. Visit their site at www.translifeline.org. I hope some of these ideas help. Feel free to send another message if you have a follow-up question.Be well....be YOU.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC ","Okay, it takes incredible strength and self-awareness to recognize you're transgender and to acknowledge the struggle it's causing you. It’s fantastic that you’re reaching out and seeking support – that’s a really important first step. It’s completely understandable that your gender dysphoria is getting difficult to manage alone, especially when you're dealing with the added weight of a potentially unsupportive family. Let's talk about strategies, and I want to emphasize that finding what works for *you* is a process of experimentation and self-discovery.

**1. Understanding and Validating Your Feelings:**

* **Recognize it's Okay to Feel This Way:** Dysphoria isn’t a sign of weakness. It’s a very common and understandable response to a mismatch between your internal sense of self and the way the world perceives you.  Don't beat yourself up for feeling dysphoric; it’s a natural reaction.
* **Journaling:** Writing down your feelings, the specific triggers, and the intensity of your dysphoria can be incredibly helpful.  It can help you identify patterns and understand what’s contributing to your distress.
* **Self-Compassion:** Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend going through a difficult time.  Negative self-talk will only amplify the dysphoria.

**2. Immediate Coping Strategies (For When the Dysphoria Hits):**

* **Grounding Techniques:** These help bring you back to the present moment when you’re overwhelmed. Try:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:** Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system.
    * **Sensory Focus:** Engage your senses – listen to calming music, take a warm bath, hold a comforting object.
* **Distraction (in moderation):** Sometimes a temporary distraction can help, but don’t use it as a long-term avoidance strategy.  Examples: reading, watching a favorite show, playing a game.
* **Affirmations:**  Repeat positive statements about yourself and your identity.  Examples: ""I am valid,"" ""I am worthy of love and respect,"" “I am embracing my true self.”

**3. Longer-Term Strategies & Support:**

* **Therapy – Absolutely Crucial:** This is *highly* recommended. A therapist specializing in gender identity can provide a safe space to explore your feelings, develop coping mechanisms, and work through any related issues like anxiety or depression.  Look for therapists who are:
    * **Gender-Affirming:** This means they understand and support transgender experiences.
    * **Experienced:**  Experience with gender identity issues is a huge plus.
    * **Finding one:** Psychology Today has a great directory: [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) – Filter by ""Gender Identity.""
* **Support Groups:** Connecting with other transgender people can be incredibly validating and empowering. You can share experiences, learn from others, and build a sense of community.
    * **Online Groups:**  Reddit’s r/trans and r/asktransgender are good starting points.
    * **Local Groups:** Search online for transgender support groups in your area.
* **MTF (Male to Female) Support Groups (if applicable):** If your dysphoria is primarily related to your physical presentation, finding a group specifically for MTF trans women can be particularly helpful.
* **Explore Your Identity:** This can involve:
    * **Experimenting with Presentation:**  This is a deeply personal process. Start small and do what feels safe and comfortable for you.
    * **Name & Pronoun Exploration:**  If you haven’t already, begin exploring a name and pronouns that feel more authentic to you.
* **HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy):** If you’re considering HRT, discuss this with a qualified medical professional who specializes in transgender care.  It can significantly reduce some aspects of dysphoria, but it’s not a magic bullet.

**4. Dealing with Family (Given Your Concerns):**

* **Prioritize Your Safety:**  Because of your past experiences, your safety and well-being are paramount.  Don’t feel obligated to disclose your identity to your family until you’re in a safe and supportive environment.
* **Limited Contact (if necessary):** It’s okay to limit contact with family members who aren’t accepting.
* **Grey Rocking:**  This technique involves becoming emotionally unreactive when interacting with someone who is being difficult or invalidating.  You provide minimal responses and avoid engaging in arguments.
* **Have a Support System in Place:**  Make sure you have people you *can* talk to – friends, therapists, support groups – to help you cope with interactions with your family.

2149,"Whenever I leave my girlfriend I get panic attacks. I'm taking medications to control them, but I'm thinking of moving in with her since I get so anxious.","I’m sorry to hear that you are currently experiencing panic attacks. I hope that the medication you have been prescribed has provided you with some relief. Unfortunately, I don’t feel that moving in with your girlfriend would alleviate your anxiety. Although you may feel very anxious about leaving her, your body is reacting to this stressful event in your life in an unhealthy manner. You may be able to render this particular situation but it’s likely that you may experience another panic attack when an additional stressful event arises. Therefore, it is essential that you address the reason for why you are experiencing panic attacks in the first place followed by practicing coping mechanisms in the case that one would arise in the future.Talk therapy has shown to be effective with those affected by anxiety along with breathing exercises and yoga. A trained therapist will be able to assist you in finding the right stress reducing method so that you can reduce the chance of another attack occurring.I wish you the best of luck! It sounds like you are very happy in your relationship and I hope you are able to reduce your anxiety so that you are able to enjoy one another.","Okay, this sounds like a really complex and challenging situation, and it’s great that you're recognizing the patterns and seeking support. Let’s break this down and explore this thoughtfully. It's fantastic that you're taking medication for your panic attacks – that's a crucial first step. And the fact that you're recognizing the connection between leaving your girlfriend and experiencing them is also incredibly important.

Here's a breakdown of what you’re describing, and some things to consider:

**1. Understanding Your Panic Attacks & Anxiety:**

* **The Cycle:** You've identified a clear pattern: leaving your girlfriend triggers panic attacks. This suggests a strong emotional attachment and likely significant anxiety around separation. It’s not just about the act of leaving; it's about the *loss* of that connection.
* **Underlying Anxiety:** Your panic attacks are being managed with medication, which is excellent. However, it’s important to understand *why* you're experiencing such intense anxiety. Are there underlying fears driving this? (e.g., fear of abandonment, fear of being alone, fear of the unknown, low self-esteem, etc.)  Your medication is helping manage the symptoms, but addressing the root causes will likely be more effective long-term.
* **Moving In = Increased Anxiety?** You’re anticipating that moving in together will *increase* your anxiety. This is a very common and valid concern. Being in a committed, interdependent relationship can amplify anxiety, especially when you're already prone to panic. The fear of losing the relationship, of things falling apart, can be incredibly powerful.


**2. Moving In – A Critical Consideration:**

* **It's a Big Step, Especially With Your Anxiety:** Moving in together is a huge step, and given your history of panic attacks triggered by separation, it's wise to proceed with extreme caution.  It could easily become a significant stressor and potentially worsen your anxiety.
* **Not a Cure:** Moving in together isn't a ""cure"" for your anxiety. It might provide a sense of stability and security, but it won’t fundamentally change the underlying anxieties.
* **Potential for Amplification:**  The increased closeness, the shared responsibilities, the potential for conflict – all of these can be intensely stressful for someone prone to panic.

**3. What You Should Do – A Suggested Approach:**

* **Talk to Your Therapist:** This is *absolutely* the most important step. Your therapist can help you:
    * **Explore the Roots of Your Anxiety:**  Dig deeper into *why* you’re experiencing these panic attacks.
    * **Develop Coping Strategies:**  Learn specific techniques to manage your anxiety in stressful situations.
    * **Assess Your Relationship:**  Objectively evaluate the relationship and your needs within it.
    * **Create a Plan:**  Develop a plan for moving forward, considering the potential challenges.
* **Communicate with Your Girlfriend:** Be open and honest with her about your anxiety and your concerns about moving in.  She needs to understand the seriousness of your situation.  A supportive partner can be incredibly helpful, but she can't *fix* your anxiety.
* **Start Small (If You Choose to Move In):** If you decide to move in, consider a trial period – perhaps a month or two – to see how it impacts your anxiety.  Don’t rush into a long-term commitment.
* **Continue with Medication & Self-Care:** Stick to your medication schedule and prioritize self-care activities that help you relax and manage stress (e.g., exercise, meditation, hobbies).

It's completely understandable that you want to handle this privately – wanting to protect yourself and your feelings is a valid response. It’s also really brave to recognize you need help. Let’s talk about how you can start to deal with depression without immediately telling someone, while still focusing on getting better.

**Important Disclaimer:** *I am an AI and cannot provide therapy or medical advice. What I offer here is information and suggestions, but it's crucial to understand that depression is a serious condition, and professional help is often the most effective path to recovery. My goal is to provide you with resources and strategies to consider, not to replace the guidance of a mental health professional.*

Here's a breakdown of things you can do, broken down into categories:

**1. Understanding and Accepting Your Feelings:**

* **Acknowledge and Validate:** The first step is simply acknowledging that you're feeling depressed. Don't minimize it, judge it, or try to push it away. Say to yourself, ""I'm feeling sad, and that's okay. It's a difficult feeling, and I'm allowing myself to feel it.""
* **Journaling:** This can be a powerful tool. Write down your thoughts and feelings, even if they seem negative or confusing. Don't censor yourself. Just let it flow. You can focus on what you're feeling, what triggers you, and any patterns you notice.
* **Self-Compassion:** Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend who was going through a tough time.  Depression can be incredibly self-critical, so actively counter those negative thoughts.

**2. Small, Manageable Steps – Building Momentum:**

* **Start Small:** Depression can feel overwhelming, so don't try to tackle everything at once. Choose *one* small thing you can do each day, and focus on that. This could be:
    * Taking a shower
    * Eating a healthy meal
    * Going for a short walk (even just around your house)
    * Listening to music
    * Reading a book
* **Routine (Even a Gentle One):**  Depression can disrupt routines.  Creating a simple, gentle daily routine can provide a sense of stability and purpose.  It doesn’t have to be rigid, but having some structure can be helpful.
* **Celebrate Small Wins:**  Acknowledge and appreciate every small accomplishment.  It’s easy to dismiss them when you’re feeling down, but recognizing your efforts can boost your mood.

**3. Self-Care Strategies:**

* **Mindfulness and Relaxation:**  Try techniques like deep breathing exercises, meditation (there are many free apps like Headspace or Calm), or progressive muscle relaxation. These can help calm your nervous system.
* **Engage in Activities You Enjoy (If Possible):** Even if you don’t feel like it, try to do things you used to enjoy, even for a short time.  Don't put pressure on yourself to be happy – just see if you can find a little bit of pleasure.
* **Physical Activity:** Exercise releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects. Start with gentle activities like stretching or yoga.
* **Get Enough Sleep:**  Sleep deprivation can worsen depression.  Establish a regular sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine.

**4. Addressing Isolation (Without Sharing Immediately):**

* **Connect with Nature:** Spending time outdoors can be incredibly beneficial.
* **Engage in Solitary Activities:** If you need time alone, that's okay. But be mindful of allowing yourself to become *too* isolated.
* **Limit Time on Social Media:** Social media can often exacerbate feelings of inadequacy and loneliness.

**5. Resources You Can Explore (Without Immediate Disclosure):**

* **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741 – this is a free, confidential service available 24/7.
* **SAMHSA National Helpline:** 1-800-662-HELP (4357) – Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.  They can provide information and referrals to treatment facilities.

* **MentalHealth.gov:** [https://www.mentalhealth.gov/](https://www.mentalhealth.gov/) – A good starting point for information and resources.

**Why It’s Okay to Not Tell Anyone *Right Now*:**

You've stated you don’t want to tell anyone, and that's your right. Sometimes, the fear of judgment, burdening others, or not being understood can be paralyzing. It’s perfectly valid to take things one step at a time.

**However, Let's Talk About the Long-Term:**

While you're taking these steps privately, it’s important to recognize that depression often *benefits* from support.  The longer you struggle in isolation, the harder it can become.

**A Gradual Approach to Sharing:**

* **Identify a Trusted Person (If Possible):**  Is there *anyone* – a family member, friend, or colleague – you feel you could eventually talk to?  You don’t have to tell them everything at once.
* **Start with “I’m Struggling”:**  You could say something like, “I’ve been going through a really tough time lately, and I’m working on getting support.”

**When to Seek Professional Help (Even if You Don't Want to Tell Anyone Yet):**

* **Thoughts of self-harm or suicide:** If you are having thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out for help immediately (Crisis Text Line, call 911).
* **Symptoms worsen significantly:** If your depression is getting worse despite your efforts.
* **You’re struggling to function:** If your depression is interfering with your ability to work, go to school, or maintain relationships.

**Resources for Finding a Therapist (You Can Explore Privately):**

* **Psychology Today Therapist Finder:** [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists)
* **Open Path Collective:** [https://openpathcollective.org/](https://openpathcollective.org/) – Offers affordable therapy options.

**Final Thoughts:**

You’ve taken a brave first step by acknowledging you need help.  Be patient with yourself, celebrate your progress, and remember that recovery is a journey, not a destination.  You don’t have to do this alone, even if you’re not sharing it with anyone yet.

**To help me give you more tailored advice, could you tell me a little more about:**

*   What kind of activities do you normally enjoy?

3252,"I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.
I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. While your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard. Talk to them during a non-emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as ""you NEVER listen,"" ""you ALWAYS say..."" and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with ""you"" try using ""I"" by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist, teacher, or school counselor if possible. Most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help.Best of luck to you.","Okay, this is a *lot*, and it sounds incredibly painful. What you're describing is a really common, yet devastating, experience, especially during the turbulent years of adolescence. It's brave of you to acknowledge these feelings and to articulate them so clearly. Let's break this down and talk about what might be going on and what you can do.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Generational Differences & Validation:** You've hit on a huge factor here. Your parents are in a different generation with different perspectives on mental health, relationships, and even just how to handle difficult conversations. Their skepticism, even if stemming from a place of wanting to protect you, can feel deeply invalidating. It’s understandable that you feel dismissed.
* **The Pansexual Experience & Trust:** The fact that you don’t trust your parents because of your identity adds another layer of complexity. Perhaps they haven't created a safe space for you to be authentically yourself, and that can be incredibly isolating.
* **The Cycle of Stress & Isolation:** You're caught in a cycle: you’re stressed and anxious, you reach out for support, and you’re met with a lack of understanding or help. This reinforces your feelings of isolation and makes it even harder to cope.
* **Lost Childhood:** It's completely valid to feel like your childhood has been stolen. The teenage years are a time for exploration, independence, and figuring out who you are. When you don’t have a supportive family to help you navigate that, it can feel profoundly disorienting.

**What You Can Do – Focusing on What *You* Can Control**

1. **Focus on Self-Care:** This is *crucial*. You’re dealing with significant stress and anxiety. Prioritize your mental and physical health. This means:
   * **Therapy:** Seriously, explore therapy options. A therapist can provide you with tools to manage your anxiety, process your feelings, and develop coping mechanisms.  Look for therapists who specialize in adolescent mental health or family dynamics.
   * **Mindfulness & Relaxation:** Practices like meditation, deep breathing, yoga, or spending time in nature can help calm your nervous system.
   * **Healthy Habits:**  Ensure you're eating nutritious foods, getting enough sleep, and engaging in regular physical activity.

2. **Manage Your Expectations with Your Parents:** You can't change them, but you *can* change how you respond to them.
   * **Lower Your Expectations:** Stop expecting them to fully understand or validate your experiences. That’s a recipe for disappointment.
   * **Shift Your Communication:** Instead of trying to convince them, try framing your feelings in terms they *might* understand. For example, instead of saying “I’m feeling really overwhelmed,” you could say “I’m feeling a lot of pressure right now, and I need some time to process it.”
   * **Limited Sharing:**  You don’t *have* to share everything with them. It’s okay to create boundaries around what you disclose.

3. **Build a Support System *Outside* Your Family:** This is absolutely key.
   * **Friends:** You mentioned your friends have their own problems. While it’s kind of you to help them, remember you need to prioritize your own needs too.  Be discerning about who you lean on. Look for friends who are genuinely empathetic and supportive.
   * **School Counselor:** Your school counselor can be a valuable resource for support and guidance.
   * **Online Communities:** There are many online communities for teens and young adults struggling with mental health issues. Finding a supportive online community can help you feel less alone.
   * **Mentorship Programs:** Look for mentorship programs in your area – these can provide a safe space to talk with someone who is invested in your well-being.

4. **Recognize Your Strength:** You've already overcome depression – that’s a huge accomplishment!  You’re navigating incredibly difficult feelings, and that takes courage.  Acknowledge your resilience.

**Important Note:**  It's okay to grieve the childhood you deserved. It's okay to feel angry, sad, and frustrated. Allow yourself to feel those emotions, but don’t let them consume you.

926,"My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the ""straight and narrow"" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that I'm not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others.    His insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","You might ask your fiance about people who have let him down in the past; past hurts from parents, friends, people he has dated. If you are speaking about jealousy he may come from a divorced parent upbringing, may have seen parents cheat on one or the other, may have had partners cheat on him in the past.  He may have fears that you may go off the ""straight and narrow"" once you get married. Listen to any concerns with patience and understanding, avoid being defensive. I would highly encourage pre-marital counseling to explore these things and individual counseling for himself to work on fears and anxieties. If he refuses and things do not improve I would consider postponing the wedding, things will not get better once you get married, only magnified.  Finally show him Bible passages about forgiveness and worry and leaning on God with faith and hope for the future.    God bless.","Okay, this is a really common and complex situation, and it’s admirable that you're recognizing the impact it's having on your relationship and wanting to help your fiancé. Let's break this down and explore how you can approach this with compassion and understanding.

**1. Understanding His Perspective:**

* **Root of the Insecurity:** His difficulty accepting your past, and his general difficulty accepting himself and others, likely stems from deep-seated insecurities. This could be tied to:
    * **Shame:** He might be experiencing shame related to his own past mistakes or imperfections.
    * **Fear of Judgment:** He might be worried about what others (including you) think of him.
    * **Low Self-Esteem:**  A lack of self-worth can make it incredibly difficult to accept yourself and others.
    * **Control:** Sometimes, holding onto rigid beliefs (like expecting virginity) is a way of trying to exert control in a situation where he feels powerless.
* **His Expectations:** He may be holding you to standards that aren't realistic or fair, perhaps based on religious teachings he’s internalized.
* **His Reaction is About Him:**  It's crucial to remember that his reaction isn't *about* you or your past. It's about *his* internal struggles.

**2. How to Respond to Him with Compassion:**

* **Validate His Feelings:** Instead of dismissing his concerns, acknowledge his emotions.  Say things like: ""I understand you're feeling insecure about this, and I can see why it's difficult for you."" or ""It makes sense that you're feeling this way, given your values.""
* **Emphasize Your Love and Commitment:** Remind him consistently that you love him and are committed to building a life together. ""I want to be with you, and I value our relationship deeply.""
* **Share Your Own Vulnerability (Carefully):**  Without dwelling on your past in a way that triggers him, you can gently share your own imperfections and past mistakes. ""I’ve made my own mistakes in the past, and I’ve learned from them. It's part of being human.""  This can help him see you as a relatable person, not a perfect ideal.
* **Focus on the Present and Future:**  Shift the conversation back to what you *can* build together. ""I'm excited about building a future with you, and I want us to focus on creating a strong and loving foundation.""
* **Avoid Defensiveness:** It's incredibly tempting to defend your past, but that will likely escalate the situation. Resist the urge to get into arguments about your past.

**3. Gently Addressing His Expectations:**

* **""Let's Talk About Our Values"":**  ""I respect your faith and your values, and I want to understand where you’re coming from. Can we talk about how we both see the importance of fidelity and commitment within our relationship?"" (This opens a dialogue without directly criticizing his beliefs).
* **Challenge Rigid Thinking (Softly):** If he's holding onto a very specific expectation (like virginity), you can gently say, ""I appreciate your values, but I believe our relationship is built on trust and love, not on a specific condition.""
* **Focus on Actions, Not Just Words:**  ""I want to show you through my actions that I'm committed to you and to our relationship.""

**4. Supporting His Self-Acceptance:**

* **Encourage Self-Compassion:** Help him develop self-compassion.  ""It's okay to make mistakes. The important thing is to learn from them and move forward.""
* **Celebrate His Strengths:**  Point out his positive qualities. ""I really admire your [kindness, intelligence, sense of humor, etc.].""
* **Suggest Professional Help (If Necessary):** If his insecurities are deeply rooted and significantly impacting his life, gently suggest therapy. “I care about you and I want you to be happy. Sometimes talking to a therapist can help us work through difficult emotions. There’s no shame in seeking support.”

**5. Important Considerations:**

* **Set Boundaries:** While you want to be supportive, you also need to protect your own emotional well-being.  If his negativity becomes overwhelming, it's okay to set boundaries. “I’m here for you, but I need you to speak to me with respect.”
* **Patience is Key:** This won’t be resolved overnight. It’s a process that requires patience, understanding, and consistent effort from both of you.
* **Reciprocity:**  Make sure you're also working on your own self-acceptance and addressing any insecurities you might have.

864,My fiancé and I broke up. He cheated on me numerous times. I kept forgiving but questioning his every move. He got tired and left.,"Cheating on you shows a lack of commitment, in addition to the emotional hurt it creates.Probably you didn't actually forgive him because if you did, then you wouldn't have been asking questions of his every move.Maybe you were open to forgiving him.   In order for forgiveness to be effective, the person who has done the injuring must first show some understanding and empathy for the great pain the person caused in you.From what you write, your fiancé didn't seem to have much interest in earning back your trust or in empathizing with the way his cheating effected you.It is very likely his tiredness is also tiredness you feel, of having to watch him all the time.As uncomfortable as adjusting with the disappointment of him leaving you, the situation you describe sounds like it was unsatisfying for both of you.","Okay, this sounds incredibly painful and exhausting. It's completely understandable that you're feeling a mix of emotions – hurt, anger, confusion, and likely a profound sense of betrayal. What you've described is a really difficult situation, and it's brave of you to acknowledge the emotional toll it's taken. Let's unpack this a bit.

**Here's a breakdown of what you're experiencing and some thoughts on how to move forward:**

**1. Validating Your Feelings:**

* **Your feelings are completely valid.**  Being cheated on repeatedly is a deeply violating experience. The constant questioning, the uncertainty, and the need to rebuild trust after each betrayal is incredibly draining and damaging. You are *not* overreacting.  It's not your fault that he cheated; his actions were his responsibility.
* **The exhaustion is real.** You mentioned you got tired of questioning every move. That’s a huge indicator that this relationship was fundamentally unhealthy and unsustainable for *you*.  Constantly being in a state of defense and scrutiny is incredibly taxing on your mental and emotional energy.
* **It's okay to grieve.** You're grieving the loss of the relationship you hoped for, the future you envisioned, and the trust you invested. Allow yourself to feel the sadness, anger, and disappointment.

**2. Understanding the Dynamics:**

* **His Departure Was a Result of His Choices:** You correctly identified that his leaving was due to his repeated infidelity and your reaction to it. He couldn’t handle the scrutiny and the need for constant reassurance that he wasn’t going to betray you again.
* **Your Forgiveness Was a Form of Enabling:** While forgiveness is a personal choice, in this situation, it seems like you were trying to fix a broken relationship that was fundamentally broken. You were trying to hold onto something that wasn't sustainable.
* **The Cycle of Betrayal and Forgiveness:** You fell into a common, unhealthy cycle: betrayal, forgiveness, questioning, and then repeating. This cycle ultimately drained you.

**3. Moving Forward – Focusing on YOU:**

* **Prioritize Self-Care:** Now, more than ever, focus on taking care of yourself. This is *crucial*. This includes:
    * **Emotional Support:** Talk to trusted friends, family members, or a therapist. Don’t isolate yourself.
    * **Healthy Habits:**  Eat well, exercise, get enough sleep. These things have a huge impact on your mood and energy levels.
    * **Activities You Enjoy:** Reconnect with hobbies you’ve neglected or try new things.
* **Set Boundaries:**  Establish clear boundaries with him.  No contact is often the healthiest option, especially in the immediate aftermath of a breakup.
* **Therapy is Highly Recommended:** A therapist can provide you with a safe space to process your emotions, develop coping mechanisms, and understand the patterns that may have led to this situation. They can also help you build healthier relationship patterns in the future.
* **Focus on Your Worth:** Remind yourself that you deserve to be in a relationship built on trust, respect, and honesty.  His actions do not define your worth.
* **Learn from the Experience:**  While it's painful, try to understand what attracted you to this type of relationship and what red flags you might have missed. This knowledge can help you make better choices in the future.

**Important Note:**  I want to reiterate that you are not responsible for his choices. His infidelity was *his* decision, and you shouldn't blame yourself for trying to make the relationship work.

2416,"My girlfriend and I have broken up and gotten back together numerous times in the past two years. We recently just broke up again last night on New Year’s Eve. When we break up, the very next day, she calls me and acts as if nothing has happened. She acts like everything is alright. This has been going on for two years. I do love her and care about her and her children a lot, but she seems really demanding as far as what she deserves from a man. She is always telling me that she deserves this and that from a man. It makes me feel like crap because I cannot give her everything that she wants. She told me one time that she wants a man who is going to be afraid to lose her. Is that a normal thing that women want, or should I just move on already? I am in my 30s and she is in her 40s.","Love is not enough to keep a relationship together.The people need to get along happily too.Let's start with knowing more about your happiness in being with your partner.The frequent break ups happen for a reason.  Try understanding more of why you go back together again.You state a few very clear reasons to not continue this relationship, such as ""feeling like crap"" and not liking that your girlfriend hopes her  partner will feel afraid to leave her.Trust your intuition telling you that these feelings matter.Sometimes men aren't sure whether following their instinct is a right action to take.It is.Also, hoping a partner will fear losing them, shows a wish to control a person.Control has nothing to do with love and trust, and these are basics of a relationship.Good luck!","Okay, this is a really complex and understandably frustrating situation. You’ve been through a lot of emotional turmoil with this woman, and the pattern you describe – the quick breakups followed by an immediate attempt to resume things – is deeply concerning and, frankly, unhealthy. Let's break down your questions and concerns:

**1. ""Is that a normal thing that women want, or should I just move on already?""**

This is the core of your question, and the answer is nuanced. The idea of wanting a partner who is ""afraid to lose them"" is *not* a universally desirable trait, but it’s a surprisingly common dynamic in some unhealthy relationships. Here's why:

* **It's rooted in insecurity:** This desire often stems from her own deep-seated insecurities and a fear of abandonment. It's a way for her to exert control and manipulate a situation.
* **It’s a power dynamic:**  Someone who wants you to be ""afraid to lose them"" is trying to position themselves as the one in need, and you as the one providing. This creates an incredibly unbalanced power dynamic.
* **It’s not about love:** Genuine love doesn’t require fear. Healthy relationships are built on trust, respect, and mutual vulnerability.

However, it's also important to acknowledge that some women *do* express a desire for reassurance and security. But this should be expressed through open communication and a commitment to building trust, not through manipulation.

**2. The Pattern of Breakups and Immediate Reconnection**

You've rightly identified this as a major issue. The fact that she calls you the next day after a breakup, acting as if nothing happened, is a classic manipulation tactic. It’s designed to:

* **Keep you off balance:** It prevents you from processing your feelings and setting boundaries.
* **Test your loyalty:** She’s seeing how much you’re willing to bend to her desires.
* **Reinforce her control:** It demonstrates that she can dictate the terms of your relationship.

**3. ""She always tells me that she deserves this and that from a man.""**

This is a huge red flag. A constant need for validation and a sense of entitlement is a sign of an unhealthy attachment style. While everyone deserves to be treated with respect, consistently demanding ""deserving"" is about her needs, not about a fair exchange in a relationship.

**4. Your Feelings and Your Age**

You're in your 30s, which is a time when people are often looking for stability and a clear understanding of what they want. The fact that you're wrestling with these questions and feeling ""like crap"" is completely valid.  Don't minimize your feelings.

**What You Should Do – Moving Forward**

Here’s a clear path forward:

* **Recognize the Pattern:** You've already taken the first step by recognizing this cycle.  Don’t fall for it again.
* **Set Firm Boundaries:** This is absolutely crucial. You need to be absolutely clear about what you will and will not tolerate. Examples: ""I need space to process my feelings after a breakup. I won’t be engaging in conversations that feel like a continuation of our relationship immediately after a breakup.""  ""I can’t be in a relationship where I feel like I’m constantly being manipulated.”
* **Don’t Respond to the Manipulation:** When she tries to elicit guilt or make you feel like you're the bad guy, don't engage. A simple, neutral response like ""I understand your feelings"" and then ending the conversation is often best.
* **Consider Therapy (for yourself):**  This situation is clearly impacting you. Talking to a therapist can help you understand your own patterns, develop healthy boundaries, and make decisions that are right for you.
* **Accept You Might Not Get What You Want:**  She’s unlikely to change. You can’t force her to be a different person or to treat you with respect.

**Ultimately, you deserve someone who values you, respects your boundaries, and builds a relationship based on mutual love and trust, not fear and manipulation.**  It’s incredibly painful to recognize that this isn’t the case, but staying in a relationship where you’re constantly feeling drained and controlled is detrimental to your well-being.

2620,"My coworkers are making false statements about me to the boss, saying I have mood swings. They have no proof to back it up. Can my employer make me see a therapist of their choice?","If this is a concern of a few coworkers, make sure it is not something they see but you don't admit to.  Employers can ""suggest"" or something ""stipulate"" in continued employment with them  for you to go to their Employment Assistance Provider (EAP) if they have noticed the same behavior and concerned of how it is effecting productivity or employee relationships.  No one wants to work in a environment which they consider hostile.  Employers can be held responsible if they do not take action.Couple of things you can do...Ask a coworker in which you trust and respect if what others are saying is true?Seek professional help from your primary care provider or counselor if mood swings do exist.      ","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's great that you're seeking advice. Let's break down your rights and what you can do. The short answer is: it's complicated, and your employer's ability to require therapy is limited, but they *do* have some leeway, particularly regarding performance issues. Here's a detailed explanation:

**1. The Legal Landscape – Generally Speaking**

* **EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) & Protected Characteristics:** The key here is whether the false statements about your mood swings are related to a protected characteristic. This is crucial. The EEOC investigates claims of discrimination based on things like race, religion, gender, age, disability, etc. If your coworkers' statements are motivated by bias against you based on one of these protected characteristics, it strengthens your position significantly.
* **Defamation:**  False statements made about you, particularly those that harm your reputation, can potentially lead to a defamation claim. However, proving defamation can be difficult, requiring you to show the statements were false, published (communicated to others), and caused damage.
* **Privacy Concerns:**  Generally, employers have limited ability to intrude on your private life, including your mental health.

**2. Your Employer's Potential Justification – Performance Issues**

This is where things get nuanced. Your employer *can* take action if your behavior is demonstrably impacting your job performance. Here’s how they might justify suggesting or requiring therapy:

* **Performance Concerns:** If your coworkers’ statements are leading your boss to believe you are consistently unproductive, unable to meet deadlines, or creating a disruptive work environment, they *could* argue that your behavior is affecting your job performance.  This is the most common scenario they'll use.
* **Workplace Conduct:** If your “mood swings” are perceived to be causing conflict with colleagues or disrupting the workplace, they might argue for intervention.
* **Company Policy:** Many companies have policies regarding employee conduct and well-being. They might use these policies to justify offering or requiring assistance.

**3. Can They Force You to Go to Therapy?**

* **Generally No – Without a Strong Performance Link:**  Simply because your coworkers are making false statements doesn’t automatically give your employer the right to mandate therapy. They can't just decide you need it.
* **Suggestion/Offer:** They *can* offer you a consultation with an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) or suggest therapy as a way to address workplace issues. Many companies provide EAPs as a benefit.
* **Conditional Support (Rare, but Possible):** In very specific cases, if your boss believes your behavior is directly impacting your work performance *and* they have a robust EAP or wellness program, they might offer to cover the cost of therapy as part of a performance improvement plan (PIP).  This is less common and often comes with specific conditions.

**4. What You Can Do – Your Rights and Actions**

* **Document Everything:** This is absolutely critical. Keep a detailed record of:
    * The false statements you’ve heard.  Note who made them, when, and what they said.
    * Any negative impact these statements have on your work or your feelings.
    * Any conversations you’ve had with your boss about the situation.
* **Speak to Your Boss (Carefully):**  Request a private meeting to discuss your concerns.  Don’t accuse your coworkers directly (focus on the impact). You could say something like, ""I'm concerned about the feedback I'm hearing and how it's affecting my ability to focus on my work. I'd like to discuss how we can ensure I'm performing at my best.""
* **Review Your Company's Policies:** Understand your company’s policies on harassment, conflict resolution, and employee assistance programs.
* **Utilize Your HR Department:** If you feel your boss is unfairly targeting you, speak to your HR representative. They can mediate and investigate.
* **Seek Legal Advice:** Consult with an employment lawyer, especially if you believe you're being discriminated against or retaliated against.  A lawyer can advise you on your rights and options.
* **Consider an EAP (Even if Offered by Your Employer):**  Utilizing an EAP can help you manage stress and develop coping mechanisms, regardless of your employer's involvement.

1602,"My ex-boyfriend and I have been back and forth for over a year now. He's in his late 20s, divorced for like five years now with two kids. He has a lot of narcissistic behaviors. He lies and cheats, but I love him. I've tried to date other people, but I always go back to him.","There are a lot of pieces to the decision of whether to stay or leave. Can you have open conversations about your concerns? Is he able to listen to that? I'm not sure how you know for sure that he lies and cheats, but does he recognize these things as problems? Which part of you is bigger: the part of you that wants to stay or the part of you that wants to leave? Can you consider what you want, wish for, and desire while also considering the same for him? Can he do that for you?","Okay, this is a really complex and challenging situation, and it’s incredibly brave of you to acknowledge it and seek understanding. What you're describing – a long-term, emotionally turbulent relationship with someone exhibiting narcissistic traits, coupled with a persistent pull back – is incredibly common, and it's vital to approach this with a lot of self-awareness and care. Let’s break this down and explore some things:

**1. Understanding the Dynamics:**

* **Narcissistic Traits vs. Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD):** It's important to distinguish between exhibiting narcissistic *traits* and having NPD. You've described lying, cheating, and manipulation – these are common behaviors associated with narcissistic tendencies. However, a formal diagnosis of NPD requires a professional assessment.  Even if he doesn't meet the criteria for a full diagnosis, the patterns of behavior you're experiencing are still deeply damaging.
* **The Cycle of Abuse/Attraction:** What you're describing sounds like you're caught in a cycle. The intense emotions – the love, the drama, the validation – coupled with the narcissistic behaviors, create a powerful, albeit unhealthy, addiction. His manipulations likely trigger a strong emotional response in you, and you then seek reassurance and connection, reinforcing his behavior.
* **Low Self-Esteem:** People drawn to narcissistic individuals often have underlying feelings of low self-esteem. The attention, even if it’s critical or manipulative, can feel validating in a way you haven't experienced elsewhere.
* **Fear of Being Alone:** The fact that you keep returning suggests a fear of being alone. This fear can be incredibly powerful and override rational thinking.

**2. Why You Keep Going Back (Let’s Dig Deeper):**

You've stated you love him, but love isn’t always enough. Here are some potential reasons you're drawn back:

* **The ""Idealization/Devaluation"" Cycle:** Narcissists often go through phases of intense idealization (you're amazing, you're the only one for me) followed by devaluation (you're annoying, you're always complaining, you’re ruining my life). You might find yourself clinging to the idealization phase, hoping it will return.
* **The Drama:** Let's be honest, the drama is captivating. It's a rollercoaster, and some people are addicted to that adrenaline rush, even if it’s painful.
* **Need for Validation:** He likely provides a level of attention and validation you might not get elsewhere. Even negative attention can feel like connection.
* **Feeling Like You Can Change Him:** This is a common, and often damaging, trap. You might believe you can ""fix"" him or change the dynamic.
* **Past Trauma:**  Previous relationships or experiences could be influencing your choices.


**3. Prioritizing Your Well-being – This is Crucial:**

* **Recognize the Pattern:** The first step is recognizing that this is a *pattern* and that you are repeatedly choosing a relationship that is ultimately harmful to you.
* **Set Clear Boundaries:** You *need* to establish firm boundaries. This might mean no contact, limited contact, or specific rules about how he treats you.  Be prepared to enforce these boundaries, even if it’s difficult.
* **Don't Chase:** Resist the urge to chase him, contact him when he doesn't respond, or try to ""win"" him back. This will only reinforce his behavior.
* **Focus on Yourself:** Invest your energy in activities that make you happy, nurture your friendships, and build your self-esteem.
* **Seek Support:** Talking to a therapist is *highly* recommended. A therapist can help you understand the dynamics of the relationship, develop healthy coping mechanisms, and build your self-esteem. They can also help you process any past trauma.

2318,"Whenever I don't tell my friends or anyone what I did or stuff that's not really important, I feel terrible, like there’s a hole in my stomach. It only goes away when I hurt myself.","Hi Kansas, I feel strongly that the help of a professional therapist is important here. Feelings are never wrong, but it can help to understand where they come from and talk to someone who can teach you healthy ways to cope. Self-harm is not the answer to managing those emotions you feel in your stomach. Although I'm glad you said something here, a professional would need to spend some time with you and get a deep understanding of your life in order to help you sort all these reactions out effectively. I hope you reach out to someone soon. ","Okay, thank you for sharing this with me. What you're describing sounds incredibly painful and distressing, and it’s brave of you to talk about it. It's really important to acknowledge that what you're feeling is valid, and you're not alone in experiencing this kind of intense emotional discomfort. Let's break down what you've said and explore this further.

**Understanding What You're Feeling**

* **The ""Hole in Your Stomach"" Feeling:** This sensation – often described as a void, emptiness, or a deep ache – is a very common description of what people experience when they feel a strong need to share or connect. It's a physical manifestation of emotional distress. It's not a literal hole, but a powerful feeling of disconnection and unmet need.
* **The Trigger – Not Sharing:** The fact that this feeling intensifies when you *don't* share something important to you suggests a deep-seated need for connection, validation, and to be seen. It’s a desire to be part of something, to have your experiences acknowledged.
* **Self-Harm as a Temporary Relief:** This is the most crucial and potentially concerning part of what you've told me. The fact that self-harm provides temporary relief is a significant red flag. It’s your brain's way of trying to cope with overwhelming emotional pain, and while it might feel like a release in the moment, it’s actually a harmful and destructive coping mechanism. It doesn’t solve the underlying problem; it just temporarily masks it.

**Why This Might Be Happening**

There are several reasons why you might be experiencing this intense need to share and the subsequent distress when you don't, and why self-harm provides temporary relief:

* **Low Self-Esteem:**  Feeling unworthy of being heard or valued can drive this need to share, hoping for validation.
* **Social Anxiety:** Fear of judgment or rejection can make it incredibly difficult to share, leading to intense anxiety and distress.
* **Difficulty Expressing Emotions:** You might struggle to articulate your feelings in a healthy way, leading to a build-up of emotion.
* **Trauma:** Past experiences, especially those involving feeling invalidated or unsupported, can significantly impact your ability to trust and share.
* **Underlying Mental Health Conditions:**  This could be related to conditions like anxiety, depression, or borderline personality disorder, which often involve intense emotional regulation difficulties.

**What You Need to Do – This is Crucial**

1. **Safety First:**  Because you're using self-harm as a coping mechanism, your safety is the absolute priority.  **If you are having thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out for help immediately.** Here are some resources that are available 24/7:
   * **The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline:** 988
   * **The Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741
   * **The Trevor Project:** 1-866-488-7386 (for LGBTQ youth)
   * **SAMHSA National Helpline:** 1-800-662-HELP (4357) – Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration

2. **Talk to Someone You Trust:**  Sharing this with a trusted friend, family member, teacher, or counselor is a vital step.  You don't have to go through this alone.

3. **Seek Professional Help:**  It’s *essential* to talk to a mental health professional – a therapist or counselor – who can help you understand the root causes of your distress and develop healthier coping mechanisms. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) are often helpful for managing intense emotions and developing skills for emotional regulation.

4. **Explore Healthy Coping Strategies:**  Instead of resorting to self-harm, let’s brainstorm some healthier ways to manage the feelings of distress:
   * **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a powerful way to process them.
   * **Creative Expression:**  Engage in activities like art, music, or writing that allow you to express yourself.
   * **Relaxation Techniques:**  Practice deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.
   * **Physical Activity:** Exercise can be a great way to release pent-up energy and improve your mood.
   * **Spending Time in Nature:**  Being outdoors can be calming and restorative.

**Let's Talk More**

I want to reiterate that you're not alone, and it takes courage to talk about this.  I'm here to listen without judgment.  To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me a little more about:

*   Can you describe a specific situation where you felt this ""hole in your stomach"" and didn't share something?
*   How long has this been happening?

*   What do you think might be contributing to this need to suppress your feelings?

1178,"My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board—no more drinking every night.
 The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.  I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. I just feel like I'm so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty. He is a good husband in every other regard.","As exasperated as you feel, and as obvious it is to you that your husband cares more about drinking than being honest with you, changing this is up to him.Does he care that you're upset with him for drinking more than he can handle?Does he care about you more than drinking?Living with an alcoholic, which is how his behavior sounds, is lonely and frustrating.Concentrate on what you like about him as he is now with his drinking.Your happiness matters.  His ignoring of what you're talking about, doesn't mean your requests are unreasonable.Be prepared to learn to live with and accept how he behaves, or not.Avoid the expectation that you can convince him to change.People change only when they realize their life can improve by changing.  He doesn't sound like this, at least now.","You are absolutely not overreacting. Your feelings are completely valid and justified. What you're experiencing is a deeply unsettling and concerning pattern, and your reaction to it is a natural response to a serious issue. Let’s break down why you’re right to feel this way and what you can do:

**Why You're Not Overreacting:**

* **Pattern of Deception:** This isn’t a one-time slip-up. You’ve caught him multiple times hiding alcohol, and he's consistently lying about it. This establishes a pattern of dishonesty and a lack of accountability.
* **Lack of Trust:** The foundation of any healthy relationship is trust. His repeated deception is actively eroding that trust. It’s understandable that you’re feeling wounded and questioning the entire relationship.
* **Ignoring Your Concerns:** You’ve been upfront with him about your concerns, and he’s dismissed them. This demonstrates a lack of respect for your feelings and boundaries.
* **The “Dead Giveaway”:** The snoring is a crucial indicator, and his refusal to come to bed is a further sign of something being amiss.
* **Your Need for Honesty:** You've communicated your expectation of honesty, and he's failing to meet it. It's reasonable to expect a partner to be truthful with you, especially about something as serious as alcohol consumption.

**What You Can Do:**

1. **Have a Serious, Calm Conversation (When He's Sober):**  You need to address this directly, but you need to do it when he’s sober. Choose a time when you can both talk calmly and rationally.  Here's a possible approach:
   * **Express Your Feelings:** ""I’m deeply concerned about your drinking. I’ve caught you hiding alcohol multiple times, and you’ve lied to me about it. This is causing me significant distress and eroding my trust in you.""
   * **State Your Needs:** “I need you to be honest with me about your drinking. I need to know what’s going on, and I need to feel like I can trust you.”
   * **Outline the Consequences (If Necessary):** “If this continues, I need to seriously consider what this means for our relationship.” (This is a firm statement, but it's important to be clear about your boundaries).

2. **Encourage Professional Help:** This is a serious issue, and he needs support. Gently suggest he talk to a therapist or counselor, especially one specializing in addiction. You can say something like, ""I want to support you, and I think talking to a professional could really help you understand what's going on and develop healthy coping mechanisms.""

3. **Set Clear Boundaries:** You need to establish firm boundaries.  This might include:
    * **No Alcohol in the House:**  Consider restricting alcohol access in the home.
    * **Open Communication:**  Insist on open and honest communication about his drinking.
    * **Consequences:**  Be prepared to follow through on the consequences you outlined.

4. **Prioritize Your Well-being:** This situation is stressful and emotionally draining for you. Make sure you're taking care of yourself – engaging in activities you enjoy, seeking support from friends or family, and potentially talking to a therapist yourself.

**Important Note:**  You are not responsible for his addiction. You can support him, but you cannot control his behavior. His willingness to acknowledge the problem and seek help is crucial.

2164,I have this weird fetish that I'm afraid to open up about it. What should I do?,"This is difficult to answer because you don’t tell us what the fetish is.  I do understand that this is something that is bothering you though. The first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not.  If this is illegal to engage in, then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urges.However, if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd, a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings.  You may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of.  You may find other people have the same interest as you.  Find a therapist that you can trust and tell them.  Don’t hold back with your therapist.  Trust me, they have heard and seen it all by now, and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress, or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are.  There is no need to suffer with this alone. ","Okay, this is a really brave first step – acknowledging that you have a fetish and that you're struggling with it. It's incredibly common to feel afraid to talk about unusual or potentially stigmatized interests, and it's completely understandable why you'd feel this way. Let's break this down and figure out some steps you can take.

**1. Validate Your Feelings & Normalize It:**

* **It's Okay to Have Unusual Interests:** First and foremost, understand that having a fetish is a normal human experience.  Fetishes are variations in sexual attraction, and they exist on a spectrum.  Many people have them, and they don't make you a bad person.  The fact that you're feeling shame or anxiety about it is a sign that you're aware of societal judgments, and that’s perfectly valid.
* **Don’t Label Yourself Negatively:** Avoid using judgmental language like “weird” or “disgusting” to describe your fetish.  These words are loaded with shame and can make it harder to accept yourself.
* **Recognize It's About Attraction:**  Fetishes are about *attraction*. It's about what you find arousing.  It doesn't necessarily reflect your broader values or how you treat others.


**2. Understanding Your Fetish (Without Judgment):**

* **Explore the Roots (Gently):**  While you don't need to dissect every detail, gently exploring *why* you're attracted to this specific thing can be helpful.  This isn’t about blaming or judging; it’s about understanding.  Some possibilities could include:
    * **Sensory Focus:** Does it relate to a particular sensory experience (e.g., textures, sounds, smells)?
    * **Symbolic Meaning:** Does it have a symbolic meaning for you?
    * **Childhood Associations:**  Could there be any related experiences from your past? (This is a delicate area, and you shouldn’t force this exploration.)
* **Keep a Journal:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings about your fetish can help you process them and gain clarity.

**3. Addressing the Fear & Shame:**

* **Identify the Source of Fear:** What specifically are you afraid of?  Is it:
    * **Judgment from others?**
    * **Negative reactions from partners?**
    * **Feeling like you're ""broken"" or ""abnormal""?**
    * **Fear of being misunderstood?**
* **Challenge Negative Thoughts:** Once you identify the source of your fear, start challenging the negative thoughts associated with it.  Ask yourself: ""Is this thought based on facts, or is it based on fear?"" ""What's the worst that could realistically happen?""
* **Focus on Self-Acceptance:**  Work on developing self-compassion. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend.  Remind yourself that you’re human, and it’s okay to have unique interests.

**4. Taking Steps Towards Sharing (When You're Ready):**

* **Start Small:** You don't have to tell everyone everything at once. Consider starting with someone you deeply trust – a close friend, family member, or therapist.
* **Choose Wisely:** Select someone who is known for being open-minded, accepting, and non-judgmental.
* **Control the Narrative:** You get to decide how much you share and what you share. You don’t owe anyone an explanation.
* **Focus on Your Feelings:** When you do talk about it, focus on *your* feelings – your attraction, your curiosity, your desire for connection. Avoid framing it as something “wrong” or “bad.”

**5. Seeking Professional Support:**

* **Therapist:** A therapist can provide a safe and confidential space to explore your fetish, address the underlying shame and anxiety, and develop coping strategies.  Specifically, a therapist specializing in sexuality or psychodynamic therapy could be particularly helpful.
* **Sex Therapist:** A sex therapist is a specialist in sexual health and relationships and can offer guidance and support.

1171,I'm 15 and my girlfriend is 14. Am I a pedophile because I'm attracted to her and she's under 18?,"No. You are not a pedophile. You are both under the appropriate age where it would be seen so. Your both only a year a part so this shouldn't a worry to you. Like Frank said below, Pedophelia is a problem that won't apply to this situation.","Okay, let's address this very important and understandably distressing question. It’s fantastic that you're recognizing this feeling and seeking information – that shows a lot of self-awareness and a desire to understand yourself.

**The short answer is: No, you are not a pedophile simply because you are attracted to your girlfriend.**

Let's break down why and what's actually going on:

**1. What is Pedophilia?**

Pedophilia is a *mental disorder* characterized by a persistent sexual attraction to children. It's not just about being attracted to someone younger; it's about a *predatory* and *inappropriate* desire, often involving fantasies, grooming, and a disregard for the child's safety and well-being.

**2. Your Feelings Are Normal (to a Point)**

* **Puberty and Attraction:** At 15, you're going through significant hormonal changes and developing romantic and sexual feelings. It’s completely normal to experience attraction to people your own age and even those slightly younger. This is a part of human development.
* **Romantic Attraction vs. Sexual Attraction:** It’s crucial to distinguish between romantic attraction (feeling love, admiration, and wanting to be close to someone) and sexual attraction (a desire for sexual activity). You can feel romantic attraction to someone your girlfriend's age and *not* have any sexual thoughts or desires.

**3. What You're Likely Experiencing:**

* **Developing Feelings:** You're likely experiencing the intense feelings of early romantic love – excitement, infatuation, wanting to spend time together, and feeling a deep connection.
* **Confusion:** It’s possible you're feeling confused because you’re navigating these new feelings alongside the awareness that your girlfriend is younger. This can naturally lead to questions and anxieties.

**4. What You *Shouldn’t* Be Doing or Thinking:**

* **Inappropriate Fantasies:** If you're having fantasies about your girlfriend that are sexual in nature, or if you’re focusing on her physical appearance in a way that feels obsessive or inappropriate, then that's a serious concern.
* **Grooming:** This refers to building a relationship with a child in a way that is manipulative or designed to exploit their trust. This is *never* okay.
* **Ignoring Boundaries:** Respecting your girlfriend's boundaries and understanding that she is a minor with different rights and protections is absolutely essential.

**5. What You Should Do:**

* **Talk to Someone You Trust:** This is incredibly important. Talk to a trusted adult – a parent, family member, school counselor, teacher, or religious leader.  Sharing your feelings and anxieties can help you process them and get support.  Don't keep these feelings bottled up.
* **Focus on Healthy Romantic Development:**  Concentrate on building a healthy, respectful, and appropriate romantic relationship with your girlfriend. This includes spending time together, sharing interests, and communicating openly.
* **Educate Yourself:** Learn more about healthy relationships, consent, and the differences between romantic and sexual attraction.

70,"I have been feeling more and more down for over a month. I have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks, but they are almost never triggered by something that I know of.","Answers about our inner lives are most successfully reached from a sense of feeling grounded in oneself.First step is to accept your nervousness and restless sleep.  As often as possible, sleep during daytimes in order for your body to catch up on its need for rest.Accept too about feeling down.  It is normal to feel down once in a while.  From this place of self-acceptance, trust any answers which come up to your mind.  Often answers about complicated topics come in small pieces, not all at once as a whole unit.Also, your description about panic attacks is also completely normal.   They often arise unrelated to particular conditions at a given moment.  They are a healthy symptom your body is trying to expel bad feelings and does this by having the anxiety erupt at times.So, self-acceptance, tolerance of being on a process of clearing out worn out emotional clutter, and sleep at odd times if possible, are all ways to stabilize yourself, which will also feel calm and good!","Okay, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and it takes courage to talk about it. Feeling persistently down for over a month, coupled with panic attacks and disrupted sleep, is a serious combination of symptoms that deserves attention. It's great that you're recognizing this and wanting to address it. Let's break this down and explore some things.

**1. Recognizing the Seriousness:**

* **What you're describing sounds like it could be related to depression or anxiety.** It's important to understand that these conditions are incredibly common, and there's no shame in experiencing them.  It’s fantastic you're acknowledging the impact on your sleep – sleep disturbances are a very common symptom of both depression and anxiety.
* **Panic attacks can be incredibly frightening and debilitating.** The fact that they're happening seemingly without a clear trigger is concerning but also not uncommon. Sometimes, panic attacks can be triggered by subtle physiological changes your body is experiencing.
* **Ignoring these symptoms won’t make them go away.**  In fact, they can often worsen over time.

**2. What You Can Do *Right Now*:**

* **Talk to Someone You Trust:**  Sharing what you're going through with a trusted friend, family member, or partner can be a huge relief. Just having someone to listen and offer support can make a difference.
* **Reach Out for Professional Help:** This is the *most* important step. Here are some options:
    * **Talk to your primary care physician (GP):** They can assess your overall health, rule out any underlying medical conditions, and refer you to a mental health professional.
    * **Mental Health Professional:** A therapist (psychologist, counselor, or psychiatrist) can help you understand the root causes of your feelings, develop coping strategies, and potentially recommend medication if needed.
    * **Crisis Resources:** If you're having thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out immediately. Here are some resources:
        * **SAMHSA National Helpline:** 1-800-662-HELP (4357) - https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline

        * **The Trevor Project:** 1-866-488-7386 (for LGBTQ youth) - https://www.thetrevorproject.org/

**3. Understanding Potential Causes (This is something a professional will help you explore):**

* **Stress:** Are you experiencing a lot of stress at work, school, or in your personal life?
* **Life Changes:** Have you recently gone through any major life changes, such as a job loss, relationship breakup, or move?
* **Underlying Medical Conditions:** Sometimes, physical health problems can contribute to mental health symptoms.
* **Genetics:** Mental health conditions can run in families.
* **Trauma:** Past trauma can significantly impact mental health.

**4. Things You Can Start Doing (Alongside Professional Help):**

* **Sleep Hygiene:** Since sleep is already a problem, focus on good sleep habits:
    * **Regular Sleep Schedule:** Try to go to bed and wake up around the same time each day, even on weekends.
    * **Relaxing Bedtime Routine:**  Take a warm bath, read a book, or listen to calming music before bed.
    * **Dark, Quiet, Cool Bedroom:** Create a sleep-friendly environment.
* **Healthy Lifestyle:**
    * **Regular Exercise:** Even a short walk can boost your mood.
    * **Healthy Diet:** Eat a balanced diet.
    * **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol:** These can worsen anxiety and sleep problems.
* **Relaxation Techniques:**  Try deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga.

1606,"I am currently suffering from erectile dysfunction and have tried Viagra, Cialis, etc. Nothing seemed to work. My girlfriend of 3 years is very sexually frustrated. I told her that it is okay for her to have sex with other men. Is that really okay?","Hi, First and foremost, I want to acknowledge your efforts to gain (your) ideal erectile function. If the medications are not working and you have taken them as prescribed, I would encourage you to seek the help of a sex therapist as the dysfunction may be due to a psychological and/or relational issue rather than a physical/medical one. As for your question, only you can answer this. Is it OK? Are you OK with her sleeping with others? Have you thought through what this may look like, feel like, become for you and her? Opening up a relationship is a choice only the people in the relationship can answer. Even then, the answer may change at any point by either of you. I encourage you to also determine what the intention is underneath your telling your girlfriend she could sleep with others. Be clear with the intention and then together have continuous conversations about the expectations of opening up (i.e.: are there any kinds of sex that is off limits, areas of the body where touch or intimacy is not allowed, are uses of safer sex required or not, do you want to know the details or not, so forth). An excellent resource would be the book ""Opening Up"" by Tristan Taormino. I wish you the best of luck!Dr. Lily Zehner, MFT-C","Okay, this is a really complex and sensitive situation, and it's fantastic that you're grappling with it thoughtfully. Let's break this down into several parts:

**1. Understanding Your ED:**

* **It’s Not Just a Physical Problem:** Erectile dysfunction is often deeply intertwined with psychological factors – stress, anxiety, depression, relationship issues, body image, and more. Simply taking medication can sometimes mask the underlying issues, rather than addressing them.
* **Further Investigation is Crucial:** You've tried common medications, which is a good start, but it's time for a deeper dive. You absolutely need to consult with a doctor specializing in sexual health (a urologist or a sex therapist). They can:
    * **Rule out underlying medical conditions:** Diabetes, heart disease, hormonal imbalances, neurological problems – these can all contribute to ED.
    * **Assess psychological factors:** They’ll likely ask about your stress levels, anxiety, relationship satisfaction, and any past trauma.
    * **Explore alternative treatments:** Beyond medication, they might suggest lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, smoking cessation), therapy, or other treatments like vacuum erection devices or injections.


**2. Your Offer of Openness – Is it Truly Okay?**

This is the core of your question, and it deserves careful consideration. Here's a nuanced breakdown:

* **It *Can* Be Okay, But It Needs Serious Discussion and Boundaries:** Offering openness about sex with other men *can* be a loving and generous gesture, especially if it's driven by a desire to alleviate her frustration and show you're prioritizing her needs. However, it's *absolutely not* a simple solution and carries significant risks.
* **Her Agency is Paramount:** **You cannot simply *offer* this and expect it to be okay.** It needs to be her *choice*, made freely and without pressure.  Your offer must be presented with complete transparency about your understanding of the potential impact and the need for ongoing communication.
* **Potential for Hurt and Distress:**  For her, this offer could be incredibly hurtful, confusing, and destabilizing. It could trigger feelings of rejection, insecurity, jealousy, and a deep sense of betrayal, even if you have no intention of acting on it.
* **Communication is Key – Before, During, and After:**
    * **Explain Your Motivation:** Clearly articulate *why* you're offering this – it’s to address her frustration and show you care about her happiness. Don’t frame it as a solution to your problem, but as a way to explore ways to reconnect and find fulfillment.
    * **Listen to Her Response:**  Her reaction will be crucial.  Validate her feelings, even if they are difficult to hear.  Ask her *exactly* what she needs and wants from you.
    * **Establish Clear Boundaries:**  If she’s open to the idea, you *must* establish very clear boundaries *together*.  This includes:
        * **Consent:**  Absolutely vital – every encounter must be consensual, enthusiastic, and ongoing.
        * **Frequency & Context:**  How often is this a possibility?  Under what circumstances?
        * **Emotional Safety:**  What does she need to feel safe and secure during these experiences?
* **It Doesn’t Solve Your ED:**  This offer won’t magically fix your erectile dysfunction. It’s a separate issue that needs professional attention.

**3. Important Considerations:**

* **Trust:** This situation hinges entirely on trust. If there isn't a strong foundation of trust in your relationship, this offer is likely to cause immense damage.
* **Her Feelings of Insecurity:**  Be prepared for her to feel insecure, even if you are completely honest and transparent.
* **Don't Use it as a Manipulation:**  This offer should never be used to control or manipulate her.

**Recommendation:**

1. **Prioritize Seeing a Specialist:** Schedule appointments with a urologist or a sex therapist.
2. **Have a Deep Conversation:**  Talk to your girlfriend *before* you make any further offers. Explain your ED, your frustration, and your desire to find a solution together.  Be prepared for her to express her feelings and concerns.
3. **Consider Couples Therapy:** A therapist specializing in relationships can help you navigate this complex situation and improve communication.

I'm always the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake. I hate falling asleep. The longest I've went without sleep is three days.","The good news about your dreams is that your fears are right at the surface of your mind so you can study them and release some of the harm from the terrifying experiences you had which created these bad memories in the first place.The bad news is the feelings themselves are sickening.Probably a therapist would be very helpful for guiding you to unfold these uneasy feelings and their source.This type of deep work is easier with emotional support from someone.  A therapist can give you this plus is knowledgeable about dynamics of someone having been emotionally harmed by another.Or, read a lot online and find out which articles resonate with your emotions.Luckily people are willing to express personal stories of recuperating a sense of peace and safety after being violated by someone.","Okay, this sounds incredibly distressing and persistent. What you’re describing – recurring nightmares, early waking, and a deep aversion to falling asleep – is a serious issue that deserves attention. It's fantastic that you're recognizing the impact it's having on your life. Let's break this down and explore what might be happening and what you can do.

**Understanding What You're Experiencing:**

* **Nightmares and Threat:** The fact that these men are trying to hurt you is a significant indicator. Nightmares often reflect underlying anxieties, fears, or unresolved emotional issues. The feeling of being threatened is a core symptom.
* **Early Awakening & Sleep Pattern Disruption:** Waking up repeatedly, especially at 4:30-6:00, is a very common symptom of anxiety and can also be linked to nightmares. You're essentially stuck between sleep and wakefulness, which is incredibly frustrating and exhausting.  The fact that you’re the last to fall asleep and the first to wake suggests a significant level of anxiety or stress contributing to this.
* **Aversion to Falling Asleep:** This is a crucial detail. It suggests a deep-seated fear or discomfort associated with sleep itself.  It's not just about the nightmares; it’s about the *process* of falling asleep.

**Possible Causes & Contributing Factors:**

* **Anxiety:** This is a very likely culprit. Generalized anxiety, social anxiety, or specific phobias can all manifest in nightmares and sleep disturbances.
* **Trauma:** Have you experienced any traumatic events in your past – even seemingly small ones – that might be surfacing in your dreams? Trauma can have a profound and long-lasting impact on sleep.
* **Stress:** High levels of stress in your life – work, relationships, finances, etc. – can significantly disrupt sleep.
* **Underlying Mental Health Conditions:**  Nightmares and sleep problems can be associated with conditions like PTSD, depression, or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
* **Medications:**  Certain medications can cause nightmares as a side effect.
* **Physical Health:**  While less likely, some medical conditions can contribute to sleep disturbances.


**What You Can Do – Immediate Steps & Longer-Term Strategies:**

1. **Talk to a Professional:** **This is the most important step.** You absolutely need to speak with a therapist or counselor. They can help you explore the underlying causes of your nightmares and develop coping strategies.  Look for someone specializing in trauma, anxiety, or sleep disorders.

2. **Sleep Hygiene – Immediate Focus:** While professional help is crucial, you can start implementing some immediate sleep hygiene practices:
   * **Relaxation Techniques:** Before bed, try relaxation techniques like:
      * **Deep Breathing:**  Box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4) can calm your nervous system.
      * **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** Tense and release different muscle groups.
      * **Guided Meditation:** There are many free apps and recordings available.
   * **Consistent Sleep Schedule:** Even on weekends, try to go to bed and wake up around the same time.
   * **Dark, Quiet, Cool Room:** Optimize your sleep environment.
   * **Avoid Screens:**  No phones, tablets, or computers for at least an hour before bed. The blue light interferes with melatonin production.
   * **Avoid Caffeine and Alcohol:** Especially in the evening.

3. **Dream Journaling:** Start keeping a dream journal.  Write down everything you remember about your nightmares as soon as you wake up.  This can help you identify patterns and triggers.

4. **Imagery Rehearsal Technique (IRT):** This is a technique therapists often use. It involves rewriting the nightmare in a more positive or neutral way, and then mentally rehearsing this new version before you fall asleep. (You can find instructions online – search “Imagery Rehearsal Technique for Nightmares”)

5. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I):** This is a highly effective therapy specifically designed for insomnia and sleep problems.

1456,What makes a healthy marriage last?,It's surprising how many folks talk too much on the subject;It's the same three things that make all relationships work:HonestyTrustRespect(in that order)Most folks fall down on the first :) (*coughcough* THERAPISTS!  Heh heh heh...),"Okay, let's tackle this big question! There's no magic formula, but research and countless stories of long-lasting marriages point to a combination of factors. Here's a breakdown of what makes a healthy marriage last, broken down into key categories:

**1. Communication - The Foundation**

* **Open and Honest Communication:** This is *the* most cited factor. It's not just about talking, but about truly sharing your thoughts, feelings, needs, and fears – even the uncomfortable ones.
* **Active Listening:**  Really *hearing* what your partner is saying, trying to understand their perspective, and reflecting back to them what you heard. It’s about empathy.
* **Non-Violent Communication:** Learning to express yourself without blaming, criticizing, or attacking. Using ""I"" statements (""I feel hurt when..."") instead of ""You"" statements (""You always..."").
* **Regular Check-Ins:**  Making time to talk about the relationship itself – how you're feeling about it, what's working, what needs attention.
* **Conflict Resolution Skills:** Learning how to argue constructively – taking breaks when needed, focusing on the problem, finding compromises.



**2. Connection & Intimacy**

* **Emotional Intimacy:** Feeling safe and understood by your partner, sharing vulnerabilities, and being able to trust them completely.
* **Physical Intimacy:** This goes beyond just sex. It includes affection, touch, holding hands, cuddling, and other ways of expressing physical closeness. The *quality* of intimacy is often more important than the quantity.
* **Shared Activities & Interests:**  Having things you enjoy doing together strengthens your bond and creates positive memories.
* **Quality Time:** Dedicated time together, free from distractions (phones, TV, etc.), where you focus on each other.
* **Acts of Service:**  Small gestures of kindness and support can go a long way – doing something for your partner that shows you care.

**3. Respect & Trust**

* **Mutual Respect:** Valuing your partner's opinions, feelings, and boundaries, even when you disagree.  This includes respecting their time, space, and individuality.
* **Trust:**  A fundamental belief in your partner's honesty and reliability.  Trust is earned and can be broken, so it's crucial to build and maintain it.
* **Appreciation:** Regularly expressing gratitude for your partner and the things they do – both big and small.
* **Acceptance:** Accepting your partner for who they are – their strengths, weaknesses, quirks, and past experiences.  Trying to change them is a recipe for resentment.

**4. Commitment & Growth**

* **Shared Values & Goals:** Having a common vision for the future – this doesn't mean you have to agree on everything, but sharing core values helps guide your decisions.
* **Willingness to Grow Together:** Being open to change, learning from your mistakes, and supporting each other’s personal growth.
* **Long-Term Commitment:**  A conscious decision to work through challenges and stay committed to the relationship, even when things get tough.
* **Forgiveness:**  Being able to forgive your partner's mistakes and move forward. Holding onto grudges will erode the relationship.

**5. Practical Considerations**

* **Financial Harmony:**  Open communication about money and shared financial goals.
* **Household Responsibilities:**  A fair division of labor around the house and with childcare (if applicable).
* **Support Systems:** Having supportive friends and family can provide a buffer during challenging times.



**Important Notes:**

* **It’s a Two-Way Street:**  All of these factors require effort from *both* partners.
* **Relationships Evolve:** What works in the early years of a marriage may not work later on.  You need to be adaptable and willing to adjust as your needs and circumstances change.
* **Seek Help When Needed:**  Don't be afraid to seek professional help (therapy or counseling) if you're struggling.  It's a sign of strength, not weakness.

2323,"I'm in a long-distance relationship with my ideal man, but I'm not as attracted to him as I should be. Everything else is perfect about him, but I find myself lusting over more attractive men. The next step is marriage, but I want to marry someone who I can wake up to and fall in love with all over again. However, I also don't want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust. Am I asking for too much in the ""perfect guy""? Is there such a thing? Am I truly in love?","Attraction is important but sometimes over-rated. I'm curious about your comment that you are not as attracted as you ""should be"" - What is your measuring stick is for what you are supposed to feel in terms of attraction in a relationship? Do you want to be sexually intimate? Do you enjoy having sex with him? Are you satisfied with your sexual relationship when you are with him? The fact that there is lust for other more attractive men does not necessarily mean anything. There will always be attractive men and more attractive men than your partner and these attractive men will be even more appealing when you are in a long-distance relationship far from the arms of your partner. Loving someone does not mean that you stop being a sexual being who no longer notices and desires attractive men. Attraction results from a number of factors beyond appearance - including the degree to which you feel emotionally open, safe, and connected and how in tune you are with each other's bodies. It sounds like you think very highly of this man ""everything else is perfect about him"". Maybe it is worth spending some more time together in the same place if that is possible before deciding on marriage or that you are not truly in love. ","Okay, this is a really common and incredibly complex situation, and you're right to be wrestling with it. It’s fantastic that you're recognizing these feelings and trying to understand them – that's the first step to navigating them. Let’s break down your questions and explore the feelings you’re experiencing.

**1. “Am I asking for too much in the ‘perfect guy’?”**

Absolutely. The pursuit of a ""perfect guy"" is a trap. Perfection doesn't exist, and striving for it sets you up for constant disappointment. Focusing solely on idealized qualities will make it incredibly difficult to truly connect with anyone. You're right to question this – it’s a recipe for unhappiness.

**2. “Is there such a thing?”**

There’s no single “perfect guy.” But there *is* such a thing as a deeply compatible and fulfilling partner. Compatibility goes far beyond just physical attraction. It's about shared values, life goals, communication styles, how you handle conflict, and a fundamental feeling of ""ease"" with someone.

**3. “Am I truly in love?”**

This is the crucial question, and honestly, it's okay to not have a definitive answer right now. Lust and love are very different things, and they can often feel similar in the early stages of a relationship. Here’s what to consider to help you answer this for yourself:

* **Lust vs. Love:** Lust is primarily driven by physical attraction and desire. Love is deeper – it involves emotional connection, vulnerability, trust, respect, and a genuine desire for your partner’s happiness. You've identified that you're experiencing lust for other men, which is a key indicator that your feelings for him might not be as deeply rooted as you initially thought.
* **What do you *feel* when you’re with him?**  Beyond the physical, how do you feel when you talk, laugh, or simply spend time together? Do you feel a sense of joy, comfort, safety, and excitement? Or does the connection feel more like a pleasant obligation, or a desire to *be* with him, rather than a deep longing to be *with* him?
* **Vulnerability & Sharing:** Are you truly sharing your deepest thoughts, fears, and dreams with him?  A crucial element of falling in love again is the willingness to be vulnerable and open with a partner.
* **Future Vision:** When you think about your future, does he play a significant role? Do you envision a life with him, even the difficult parts?

**4. ""I want to marry someone who I can wake up to and fall in love with all over again.""**

This desire is incredibly insightful. It speaks to a fundamental human need – the desire for romance and passion to evolve over time. It suggests that you're not seeking a static, comfortable relationship, but one where love can grow and deepen. This is a wonderful goal to have!


**Here's what you can do moving forward:**

* **Self-Reflection:** Spend dedicated time honestly examining your feelings. Journaling can be a really helpful tool.
* **Communicate (Carefully):** This is tricky, but you could gently express your desire for a continuing evolution of your connection.  Something like, ""I really value the connection we have, and I'm excited about our future together. I also believe that relationships evolve over time, and I want to make sure we're both committed to nurturing that growth.""  Avoid accusatory language.
* **Focus on Shared Experiences:**  Invest in activities you both enjoy – things that create positive memories and strengthen your bond.
* **Challenge Your Thoughts:** When you find yourself fixated on other men, acknowledge the thought, and gently redirect your attention back to your current relationship.
* **Consider Therapy (Individual or Couples):**  A therapist can provide a safe space to explore your feelings, identify patterns, and develop healthy communication strategies.

**Important Note:** It’s okay to acknowledge and explore these feelings without feeling guilty. It’s a sign of self-awareness and a desire to build a truly fulfilling relationship.

**Ultimately, you deserve a relationship where you feel deeply loved, connected, and excited. Don’t settle for anything less.**

811,How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,"This can be a very challenging decision, and it may take time for you to sort through all of your feelings about the relationship and its possible end. Therapy can help you have a space to be completely honest with yourself about your relationship as you grapple with your decision of whether to remain with your boyfriend. Your therapist can ask questions to guide you in uncovering your true feelings about whether this is the right relationship for you, and he or she can support you in whatever decision you come to.","Okay, this is a really tough one, and it's great that you're taking the time to think it through. Deciding whether to end a relationship is a huge decision, and there's no easy answer. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, broken down into steps and considerations:

**1. Self-Reflection - Understanding Your Feelings & Needs:**

* **Identify the Core Issues:** Don't just think ""I'm unhappy.""  Get specific. What *exactly* is making you unhappy?  Write it down.  Here are some categories to consider:
    * **Communication:** Do you feel heard and understood? Do you struggle to communicate effectively? Are there consistent misunderstandings?
    * **Values & Goals:** Are you fundamentally incompatible in terms of what you want out of life (career, family, lifestyle, etc.)?
    * **Emotional Needs:** Are your emotional needs being met in the relationship? Do you feel supported, loved, appreciated, and respected?
    * **Respect & Trust:**  Is there a lack of respect, honesty, or trust?  This is a *huge* red flag.
    * **Conflict Resolution:** How do you handle disagreements? Do you fight fairly? Do you feel like you're constantly walking on eggshells?
    * **Intimacy & Connection:** Are you feeling a lack of physical or emotional intimacy?
    * **Red Flags:** Are there any abusive behaviors (verbal, emotional, physical)? This is *never* okay and deserves immediate attention and safety planning.
* **Rate Your Happiness:** On a scale of 1 to 10, how happy are you in the relationship overall?  Be honest with yourself.
* **What are you *missing*?**  Sometimes, unhappiness in a relationship isn't about the partner, but about something you're missing in your own life – a career, a hobby, friendships, self-care.  Could addressing these things improve the relationship, or are they contributing to your unhappiness?
* **Imagine the Future:**  Can you realistically see yourself being happy with this person long-term?  This is a crucial question.

**2. Analyze the Relationship Dynamics:**

* **Is it a Pattern?** Have these issues been present throughout the relationship, or are they new?  Recurring problems are often harder to resolve.
* **Have You Tried to Fix Things?** Have you and your boyfriend talked openly and honestly about these issues? Have you tried to implement solutions (e.g., couples counseling, new habits, compromise)? If not, why not?
* **Is He Willing to Change?**  Change requires effort from *both* sides. Is he willing to acknowledge the problems and work on them with you?  Is he defensive or unwilling to take responsibility?
* **What's His Perspective?**  Try to understand his perspective.  He might not realize the impact of his actions or behaviors.  (However, this doesn't excuse harmful behavior).
* **Consider the History:**  What's your overall history together like?  Are there positive memories and shared experiences, or is it mostly conflict and negativity?

**3.  Decision Time - Weighing Your Options:**

* **Option 1: Work on It (With Realistic Expectations):** If there are issues you *can* address, and both of you are committed to change, consider couples counseling or actively working on improving communication and connection.  Set clear boundaries and expectations.
* **Option 2: Take a Break:** A trial separation can sometimes provide clarity and perspective. However, it’s important to have clear rules and expectations for the break.
* **Option 3: End the Relationship:** If the issues are fundamental, unresolvable, or if you consistently feel unhappy and unsupported, ending the relationship might be the healthiest choice.

**4. Important Considerations & Red Flags:**

* **Abuse:** If you are experiencing any form of abuse (physical, emotional, verbal, financial), *leave immediately*.  Your safety is paramount. Reach out to a domestic violence hotline or support organization. (See resources below).
* **Gut Feeling:** Sometimes, you just *know*. Trust your intuition. If something feels fundamentally wrong, it probably is.
* **Don't Stay Out of Fear:** Don't stay in a relationship because you're afraid of being alone, of hurting him, or of what others might think.
* **Don't Make a Rash Decision:** Take your time. Don't make a decision in the heat of the moment.

1377,"My older brother (in his 60s) started dating a lady with Asperger's. She is hyper-sexual and flirty. She does not understand boundaries. They’ve been dating for a few months, and she's talking marriage. Another sibling and his wife have met her, and they have said she is never invited back. My brother always picks similar ladies. Do we speak honestly and risk losing a relationship?","If you and your brother are open w each other and respect each other’s opinions then there is little risk your relationship with him will end.If there already is strong animosity, mistrust, dislike between both of you then there is more chance he will not seriously consider your advice.For your own peace of mind, say whatever you feel must be said to him.The person you’ll need to live with is yourself so do what you believe is needed for you to feel good about saying what’s necessary.Even if he never follows through with your advice then you’ll still know you tried your best to advise.","This is a really tough situation, and you’re right to be concerned. It's completely understandable that you're feeling anxious and protective of your brother. Let's break down the situation and talk about how to approach it – acknowledging the risks while also considering the potential benefits of speaking up.

**1. Understanding the Dynamics:**

* **Asperger's and Social Understanding:** Asperger's (now often referred to as Autism Spectrum Disorder – ASD) is characterized by differences in social communication and interaction. Individuals with ASD often have difficulty understanding and interpreting social cues, including boundaries, sarcasm, and unspoken expectations. This can manifest as seeming overly direct, intense interest, and a literal interpretation of words. It doesn't mean she *wants* to disregard boundaries, but her brain processes them differently.
* **Hyper-Sexual Behavior:** This is a significant concern. It's important to understand *why* she might be exhibiting this behavior. It could be related to difficulties with social understanding, a need for intense connection, or possibly other underlying factors.
* **Your Brother's Pattern:** You've correctly identified a pattern. This suggests there might be an underlying attraction to certain types of women, perhaps unconsciously drawn to someone who challenges his social norms or provides a different kind of connection.
* **Sibling & Wife's Concerns:** The fact that your brother's siblings and your wife have expressed concern is a critical indicator. They're observing something you might be missing.

**2. Should You Speak Honestly? – The Risks and Rewards**

Yes, you absolutely should speak honestly, but with a careful and strategic approach. Here’s a breakdown of the risks and rewards:

* **Risks of Speaking Up:**
    * **Conflict:** She may become defensive, angry, and accuse you of trying to control her life.
    * **Damaged Relationship:** The most significant risk is damaging your brother’s relationship with her, which could lead to estrangement.
    * **He Might Dismiss Your Concerns:** He might simply not believe you or minimize your concerns.
* **Rewards of Speaking Up:**
    * **Protecting Your Brother:** This is the primary reason to speak up. You're trying to safeguard him from potential harm, manipulation, or a situation he might later regret.
    * **Helping Him Gain Perspective:** You might be able to gently help him see the situation more clearly.
    * **Potential for Her to Recognize Her Behavior:**  She might become aware of how her actions are perceived and adjust her behavior.

**3. How to Approach the Conversation:**

* **Start with Concern, Not Judgment:** Don’t attack her character. Frame your conversation around your concern for your brother's well-being.  Something like: ""We’re just a little worried about you, [Brother's Name]. We love you and want you to be happy, but we’ve noticed how quickly things seem to be moving and we just want to make sure you’re feeling comfortable and secure.""
* **Focus on Observations, Not Accusations:** Instead of saying “You’re being too forward,” say “We’ve noticed you’re expressing a lot of romantic interest very quickly, and we’re wondering if you’re feeling pressured or if you’re truly comfortable with the pace.”
* **Highlight the Sibling & Wife's Feedback:** “Your siblings and [Wife’s Name] have mentioned they’ve noticed similar things. They just wanted to share their perspective, and honestly, it made us think about it too.”
* **Ask Open-Ended Questions:** “How do you feel about the level of intimacy in your relationship?” “Do you feel like your needs are being met?” “Do you feel like you’re able to express your boundaries clearly?”
* **Emphasize Support:** ""We're here for you, no matter what. We just want to make sure you're in a healthy and fulfilling relationship.”

**4. Important Considerations:**

* **Don't Try to Control Her:** Your goal isn’t to dictate her relationship. It's to help her understand her behavior and ensure she’s making informed decisions.
* **Accept That You Can't Change Her:** Ultimately, she has to be willing to recognize and address her own behavior.
* **Set Boundaries for Yourself:**  You can limit your involvement in the relationship if it becomes too stressful for you.

**5. Resources:**

* **Autism Speaks:** [https://www.autismspeaks.org/](https://www.autismspeaks.org/) – Excellent resources on understanding ASD.
* **Psychology Today Therapist Finder:** [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) – You might consider suggesting she speak with a therapist who specializes in ASD.

1577,"We’ve been together almost three years. We argue and he ends it by telling me he doesn’t love me. It's hurtful because I am all about resolving the problem, and he dwells on the issue even if I drop what he's done and just swallow my pride and say I am sorry. How can this be resolved? We have kids, and I don't want a broken family because we can't communicate.","You can't fix this by yourself, but I applaud you for trying. One person working hard in a relationship can make things better for a while., but in the long haul you need two people giving some effort. I'm reading between your lines here and I wonder if your need to keep the family together is getting you to apologize when you've done nothing wrong and ignore things you've felt hurt by. I sense that you're doing all the work...that it's not balanced. I have worked with many couples and I've learned never to underestimate what kind of change is possible; anything is possible. But in order for change in a couple to occur, you need two people who are both willing to own their choices and behaviours, and who have empathy. Your boyfriend doesn't appear to have these components; he pushes you away and blames you when he's done something hurtful.Can you be honest with yourself about what's happening? I encourage you to sit down with a trusted friend or therapist and look at what you have here and what your options are. I wish you well.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it’s incredibly painful to be in a cycle of arguing, him ending things with the ""I don't love you"" line, and then you feeling like you're bearing the brunt of the problem-solving. It's fantastic that you recognize this pattern and its impact, and even more importantly, that you're focused on preserving your family. Let’s break down how to approach this, acknowledging the complexities with kids involved.

**1. Understanding His Behavior (Without Taking It Personally - This is Crucial)**

* **He's Likely Driven by Avoidance:** The “I don’t love you” line is almost always a tactic to end the conversation and avoid dealing with the underlying issue. It's a way to shut down, not a genuine expression of his feelings. This suggests he may struggle with vulnerability and conflict resolution.
* **Possible Underlying Issues:** There could be deeper issues he's not addressing, like:
    * **Fear of Intimacy:** He might be afraid of being truly seen and known.
    * **Low Self-Esteem:** He could be using this as a way to deflect feelings of inadequacy.
    * **Unresolved Past Trauma:** Sometimes, past experiences can manifest in unhealthy relationship patterns.
    * **Lack of Emotional Regulation:** He might not have the skills to manage his emotions effectively during conflict.
* **It's Not About You:** This is the hardest part to accept, but it's critical. His reaction isn’t a reflection of your worth or your ability to resolve things. It's about *his* internal struggles.


**2. What You Can Do (Focus on Your Boundaries and Your Wellbeing)**

* **Stop Trying to ""Fix"" It:** This is the single most important thing. You've identified this pattern, and it's exhausting.  Each time he says “I don’t love you,” you're investing in a response that isn’t likely to change his behavior.  You're reinforcing the dynamic.
* **Grey Rock Method:** This technique involves becoming uninteresting to him. When he brings up an issue, respond with brief, neutral statements like, “I hear you,” “Okay,” or “I understand.”  Don’t engage in arguments, defend yourself, or offer explanations. The goal is to deprive him of the emotional reaction he’s seeking.
* **Set Clear Boundaries:**  “I’m not going to continue this conversation if it ends with you telling me you don't love me. I'm happy to talk about [the issue], but that phrase shuts down communication.”  Be prepared to end the conversation if he uses that phrase.
* **Take Care of Yourself:** This situation is draining. Prioritize your mental and emotional health.  Talk to a therapist, lean on supportive friends and family, and engage in activities that bring you joy.

**3. Communication (Limited and Strategic)**

* **Short, Focused Statements:** If you choose to engage *at all*, keep your responses brief and focused on the specific issue, not on his feelings or your needs. “I’m feeling hurt when you say that.”
* **Don’t Apologize for Your Feelings:** You can apologize for *how* you reacted, but not for *having* feelings. “I regret saying that, but I was feeling hurt.”
* **Reflect, Don’t React:** Take a moment to process his words before responding.


**4. Considering the Kids – This is Paramount**

* **Model Healthy Conflict Resolution (Even if He Doesn't):**  Show your children how to handle disagreements respectfully.
* **Shield Them:**  Minimize their exposure to the conflict. Don’t involve them in arguments.
* **Focus on Stability:**  Create a predictable and loving environment for them, regardless of the issues in your relationship.

**5. Seeking Professional Help (Highly Recommended)**

* **Individual Therapy for You:** A therapist can help you process your emotions, develop coping strategies, and set healthy boundaries.
* **Couples Therapy (Potentially, but with Caveats):** Couples therapy *might* be helpful if he's willing to participate genuinely and is willing to address his own issues. However, if he’s only using therapy to “fix” you, it will be ineffective.  Look for a therapist who specializes in communication and attachment issues.

**Important Note:**  You cannot *make* him love you or change his behavior. You can only control your own actions and reactions.  If he consistently refuses to take responsibility for his part in the relationship and continues to use the ""I don't love you"" line to avoid conflict, you need to seriously consider whether this relationship is sustainable for your well-being and the well-being of your children.

He knows it's wrong; we have did time out, spanking, taking away toys, and sitting on the wall. I am afraid for my daughters safety!","I can see why you are alarmed. That is a scary situation for a parent. Do you know if the child has been evaluated by a mental health professional? Early treatment is often the key. A professional will be able to help the child learn how to control their anger and mend the troublesome actions into more appropriate responses. Have you addressed your concerns with the child's other parent? There could be contributing factors in his life that could be causing these issues (exposure to violence, sexual/physical abuse, drug use, stressful events in his life, etc.). It is important that these factors are identified so that they can either be eliminated and/or reduced. I wouldn't hesitate to have him evaluated (if he hasn't been already) and to ensure that he is getting the help that he needs whether it be medication and/or therapy. Until then, I would make sure that he is always supervised under an adult's care.","Okay, this is a really serious and incredibly difficult situation, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling afraid and frustrated. Four years of this behavior is a long time, and the fact that it's escalating is deeply concerning. Let's break down what's likely happening and, most importantly, what you can do to address it.

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Power and Control:** At 8, your stepson is likely asserting a significant amount of power and control, especially over his sister. This is a common dynamic in stepfamily situations, where established hierarchies are being re-negotiated. He’s learned that he can intimidate her into silence.
* **Testing Boundaries:**  Eight-year-olds are constantly testing boundaries. He’s pushing the limits of what he can get away with, and he's discovered that intimidation is a successful tactic.
* **Lack of Empathy:** While he knows it's ""wrong,"" he likely doesn't fully grasp the *impact* of his actions on his sister. He may not be able to truly understand her fear or distress.
* **Learned Behavior:** He’s learned that when he threatens her, she complies. This reinforces the behavior, making it more likely to continue.
* **Possible Underlying Issues:** It's also possible that there are underlying issues contributing to his behavior, such as insecurity, a need for control stemming from his own childhood, or even a lack of understanding about conflict resolution.

**Why He's Choking Her (Physically & Figuratively)**

You describe him ""choking"" her – this isn’t just physical, it’s a metaphor for silencing her. This behavior can manifest in several ways:

* **Threats of Physical Harm:** This is the most concerning and needs to be addressed immediately.
* **Verbal Intimidation:** ""Don't tell on me,"" ""You'll regret it,"" etc.
* **Withholding Affection/Attention:** He might deliberately ignore her or refuse to play with her.
* **Manipulation:** He might try to make her feel guilty or responsible for his own actions.

**What You MUST Do – Immediate Steps**

1. **Safety First:** Your daughter’s safety is paramount.  If you feel his threats are escalating to a point where you fear for her physical safety, consider separating them completely, even temporarily.

2. **Clear, Firm, and Unified Front:** You and your partner *must* be on the same page. Any disagreement or wavering on your part will be exploited by him.

3. **Immediate Consequences (Beyond Time-Outs):** Time-outs, spanking, and taking away toys are *not* effective for this type of behavior. They don't address the power dynamic. You need consequences that directly address his intimidation tactics. Here are some ideas:
   * **Loss of Privileges:**  Loss of screen time, special activities, or access to things he enjoys.
   * **Restitution:**  Have him apologize sincerely and then do something to make amends for his actions (e.g., help her with a chore, assist with a task she needs help with).
   * **Removal from the Situation:** Immediately remove him from the situation when he’s intimidating his sister. This is crucial.

4. **Teach Your Daughter How to Respond:**  This is incredibly important.
   * **""I Need a Grown-Up"" Technique:** Teach her to say, ""I need a grown-up,"" and then walk away from the situation.  Practice this with her.
   * **Role-Playing:** Practice scenarios where he tries to intimidate her, and she calmly says, ""I need a grown-up.""
   * **Empowerment:**  Help her understand that she has the right to feel safe and that she doesn't have to tolerate being intimidated.

5. **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed record of every incident – date, time, what happened, your response, and your daughter’s reaction. This is crucial if you need to seek professional help or consider further action.

6. **Talk to Him Directly (Carefully):**  When he’s calm, have a serious conversation.  ""I’ve noticed you’ve been telling [daughter’s name] not to tell on you. That’s not okay. It makes her feel scared and unsafe, and it’s not how we treat people.  I need you to respect her feelings and choices."" Focus on the *impact* of his behavior.

**Seeking Professional Help – Absolutely Necessary**

* **Child Psychologist/Therapist:** This is where you *need* to go. A therapist can help your son understand the root causes of his behavior, develop empathy, and learn more appropriate ways to handle conflict. They can also help your daughter process her feelings and build her confidence.
* **Family Therapist:**  A family therapist can help you all navigate the complexities of a stepfamily and improve communication.

**Important Considerations**

* **Don’t Engage in Power Struggles:**  Don't get drawn into arguments with him. Stay calm and firm.
* **Don’t Take It Personally:** This is about *his* behavior, not about you.
* **Be Patient:**  Changing deeply ingrained behavior takes time and consistent effort.

3467,"I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out. 

How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it.  I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy.  What should I do?","While this might not be the first thing you want to discuss when you meet someone, it is important for you to be yourself.  It's better to weed out 10 people who can't accept you to find that one who can.  ","Okay, this is a really complex and layered situation, and it's fantastic that you're recognizing the internal conflict and wanting to find a way to navigate it healthily. You're grappling with your identity, attraction, and how to communicate that to others – and that's a lot to process. Let's break this down and explore some options, with a focus on your wellbeing and building healthy relationships.

**1. Understanding the Core Issues:**

* **Your Feminine Expression:** You enjoy being feminine, which is a perfectly valid and beautiful thing. It's about how you present yourself and how you *feel* – it doesn’t dictate your sexuality.
* **Your Attraction to Women:** This is a fundamental part of who you are. It’s not something to be ashamed of or to feel like you need to hide indefinitely.
* **The Crossdressing Aspect:** This is likely intertwined with your femininity and potentially your attraction to women. It's important to understand *why* it brings you joy. Is it about self-expression, feeling beautiful, or something else?
* **The Worry About Reactions:** The fact that it ""bothers girls you date or ask out"" is a key indicator that you're prioritizing external validation over your own authenticity. This is a common experience for people who don't fit neatly into traditional gender roles.

**2. Should You Be Upfront? – A Nuanced Approach**

There's no one-size-fits-all answer. Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons of being upfront, and suggestions for *how* to do it:

* **Holding Back (Keeping it a Secret):**
    * **Pros:** Avoids immediate rejection, protects you from potential judgment.
    * **Cons:** Creates a foundation of dishonesty, can lead to resentment, potentially prevents you from finding someone who accepts you fully. It can also be incredibly draining to constantly manage the secret.
* **Being Upfront (Gradual Disclosure):** This is generally the healthier long-term approach, but needs to be done thoughtfully.
    * **Start with Shared Values:** Focus on connecting with women based on shared interests, values, and personality. Let them get to know you *before* diving into your more complex feelings.
    * **Introduce the Crossdressing Gradually:** Don't drop a bombshell. You could say something like, ""I enjoy exploring different ways of expressing my femininity. I sometimes crossdress, and it’s a way for me to feel comfortable and confident in my own skin."" Frame it as a part of *you*, not a defining characteristic.
    * **Focus on *Why* It Matters to You:** “It’s important for me to be authentic and express myself fully.”
    * **Gauge Their Reaction:** Pay attention to how they respond. Are they curious and accepting, or uncomfortable and dismissive?

**3.  Should You Stop Crossdressing?**

* **No, not necessarily.**  Crossdressing is a form of self-expression.  Stopping it solely to avoid rejection would be denying a significant part of who you are.
* **Consider *why* you crossdress.**  If it’s primarily to appease others, that’s a problem. If it brings you genuine joy and self-acceptance, then continue to do it.

**4.  Prioritizing Your Wellbeing:**

* **Self-Acceptance is Key:**  The most important thing is to accept yourself – all aspects of you, including your femininity, your attraction to women, and your crossdressing.  Work on building self-esteem and confidence.
* **Therapy:** Seriously consider talking to a therapist, particularly one experienced with gender identity, sexuality, and relationships. They can provide a safe space to explore your feelings, develop coping strategies, and navigate challenging conversations.
* **Support Groups:** Finding a support group for crossdressers or LGBTQ+ individuals can offer a sense of community and understanding.
* **Focus on Healthy Relationships:** Seek out women who value you for *who you are*, not based on a preconceived notion of what you ""should"" be.

**5.  Important Considerations:**

* **Not Everyone Will Be a Match:** It’s entirely possible that some women won’t be receptive to your crossdressing or your attraction to women. That’s okay! Don’t waste your energy trying to force a connection where it’s not wanted.
* **Your Boundaries:**  Be clear about what you’re comfortable sharing and what you’re not. You don’t owe anyone a detailed explanation.

3109,"I just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. My family and I really need this job.

People keep telling me I have ""anxiety"" and I'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. This is all new to me. What can I do?","It is ok to have anxiety.   Please don't be anxious about being anxious.If you feel anxiety coming over you, then pull off the road to a safe place.   Concentrate on centering yourself and to breath slowly.   Take some sips of water.  Sit still.     The anxiety should pass in about twenty minutes.If it does not pass, then continue calming yourself until you feel safe enough to drive to your hotel.     You can always explain to your supervisor that you were taking care of a medical problem, because anxiety is a medical problem.","Okay, this is a really understandable and valid fear. It's fantastic that you're recognizing this anxiety and wanting to address it before you start traveling. It’s also completely normal to feel overwhelmed when facing a big change like this, especially when you're already experiencing anxiety. Let's break this down and figure out some strategies.

**1. Understanding Your Anxiety:**

* **It’s Okay to Feel This Way:** First and foremost, know that having anxiety about a big change is *completely* normal. The uncertainty, the distance from loved ones, and the unfamiliar environment can all trigger anxiety. Don’t beat yourself up for feeling this way.
* **What Triggers You?** Try to pinpoint *specifically* what aspects of this trip are triggering your anxiety. Is it:
    * **The Unknown:** Fear of the unfamiliar, new places, new people?
    * **Being Away From Family:** Feeling isolated and missing your support system?
    * **Potential for Difficult Situations:** Worrying about delays, lost luggage, uncomfortable situations.
    * **Physical Symptoms:**  You mentioned the fear of an anxiety attack – are you worried about the physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, dizziness?
* **Normal vs. Clinical Anxiety:** It’s important to distinguish between normal anxiety and clinical anxiety. If your anxiety is significantly impacting your daily life, relationships, or work, it might be worth talking to a doctor or therapist.  But for now, let's focus on managing the anxiety you're feeling *right now*.

**2. Practical Strategies for Managing Anxiety on the Road:**

* **Preparation is Key:** The more you can control, the less anxiety you’ll feel.
    * **Route Planning:**  Plan your route in detail. Knowing where you're going and having a backup plan if something goes wrong can be hugely reassuring.
    * **Packing Essentials:** Pack a comfort kit: things that make you feel safe and calm – favorite snacks, calming tea, a familiar blanket, photos of loved ones, noise-canceling headphones.
    * **Emergency Contacts:** Have a list of emergency contacts readily available (family, doctor, local emergency services).
* **Relaxation Techniques:** These are your go-to tools. Practice them *before* you leave and then use them regularly on the road.
    * **Deep Breathing Exercises:** Box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4) is incredibly effective.
    * **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** Tense and release different muscle groups to release physical tension.
    * **Mindfulness Meditation:** Focus on the present moment – your senses, your breath. There are tons of guided meditations available on apps like Headspace, Calm, or Insight Timer.
    * **Visualization:**  Imagine yourself successfully navigating a challenging situation.
* **Create a Routine:**  A consistent routine can provide a sense of normalcy and control. This could include set times for meals, sleep, exercise (even a short walk), and relaxation.
* **Stay Connected (Strategically):**  It’s okay to miss your family, but overdoing it can actually *increase* anxiety. Schedule regular calls or video chats, but also allow yourself time to disconnect and focus on your own well-being.
* **Small, Achievable Goals:**  Break down your trip into smaller, manageable steps. Celebrate each accomplishment – even small ones – to boost your confidence.

**3. What to Do *During* an Anxiety Attack (If It Happens):**

* **Recognize It’s Temporary:** Remind yourself that the anxiety is a feeling, not a reality. It will pass.
* **Grounding Techniques:** These help bring you back to the present moment:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Focus on Your Senses:**  Really pay attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground, the temperature of the air, the sound of the engine.
* **Continue Breathing:** Deep, slow breathing is key.

**4. Support & Communication:**

* **Talk to Your Family:**  Let your family know you're experiencing anxiety and that you appreciate their support.  Open communication can reduce feelings of isolation.
* **Talk to Your Employer:** Let your employer know you’re adjusting to the change and that you’re working on strategies to manage your anxiety. They may be able to offer support or flexibility.
* **Consider Therapy:**  If your anxiety is persistent or overwhelming, talking to a therapist can provide you with tools and strategies to cope.

1713,"I have been noticing myself really enjoying watching/reading about gay or lesbian couples. I've also been imagining what it might be like to date a girl, and I like the idea. I also find guys cute too. Does this make me bisexual?",Hello!  Thank you for your question.  Exploring your sexual orientation and attraction is a wonderful opportunity to get to know yourself!  I would be curious to know what feelings you might have related to the possibility of being bi; What messages you may have received related to this orientation and any concerns you have about possible sexual orientations.,"Okay, let's unpack this. It's fantastic that you're starting to explore your feelings and curiosity about attraction. What you're describing – enjoying stories about LGBTQ+ couples, imagining dating a woman, and finding men attractive – is a really common and valid experience. It absolutely doesn't automatically mean you're bisexual, but it *does* suggest you're open to attraction to more than one gender.

Here's a breakdown of why your feelings are understandable and what they might mean:

**1. Attraction is Complex & Fluid:**

* **Attraction isn't always black and white:**  Human attraction is incredibly complex. It's influenced by everything from physical appearance to personality, shared values, and emotional connection.  It's not always neatly categorized.
* **Fluidity is Normal:**  Many people's attractions shift and change over time. What you find attractive now might be different in the future, and that's perfectly okay.
* **Experimentation & Exposure:**  Simply being exposed to different types of relationships and people can naturally spark curiosity and attraction.  Enjoying stories about gay or lesbian couples can simply mean you appreciate loving relationships, regardless of the gender of the people involved.

**2. Why You Might Be Feeling This Way:**

* **Romantic Fantasy & Idealization:**  It's common to have romantic fantasies, especially when you're young or exploring your identity. These fantasies often involve idealizing relationships and the people in them.
* **Curiosity about Different Experiences:**  You may be genuinely curious about what it’s like to be in a relationship with a woman or to experience attraction to women.
* **Openness to Love:**  Ultimately, wanting to experience love and connection is a beautiful thing.  Your feelings suggest you’re open to the possibility of romantic relationships with anyone you connect with.

**3. What ""Bisexual"" Means (and Doesn't Mean):**

* **Attraction to More Than One Gender:** Bisexuality is generally defined as attraction to both men and women. However, the *experience* of bisexuality varies greatly from person to person.
* **It’s Not Just About Having a Boyfriend/Girlfriend:** Being bisexual isn’t about *having* had a boyfriend or girlfriend. It’s about the *potential* for attraction.
* **Different Interpretations:** Some people identify as bisexual and feel a primary attraction to one gender, while others feel a more balanced attraction. 

**4. What to Do Now:**

* **Explore Your Feelings Without Labels:** Don’t feel pressured to immediately label yourself. Spend time understanding what you're feeling without needing to put a name on it.
* **Self-Reflection:** Ask yourself *why* you’re enjoying these stories or fantasies. What specifically do you find appealing?  What qualities do you admire in the people you’re imagining with?
* **Expand Your Exposure:** Continue to explore diverse relationships and stories. This can help you understand different experiences and potentially clarify your own feelings.
* **Talk to Someone You Trust:** If you’re struggling to understand your feelings, consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist.

**Important Note:** It's okay not to have all the answers right now. This is a journey of self-discovery.  Be patient with yourself, and allow yourself to explore your feelings without judgment.

2821,"I've tried working out and eating fruits and vegetables, but I always seem to eat the junk in the house.","I know some people do better when they don't have as much junk food in the house. This is not as tempting then. Having said that, maybe you can reward yourself with different things, such as having dessert on certain days. If you are concerned about mostly eating habits, consider seeing a nutritionist. They can help you find the balance between what it is that you really want and your goals. I'm not sure how this links to happiness for you, but hopefully looking at your choices can lead you toward your goal of being healthier.","Okay, this is a really common struggle! It's fantastic that you've already taken steps – trying to work out and eat healthier is a huge first step. The fact that you're recognizing the pattern of reaching for junk food when it's available is also incredibly important. Let’s break this down and figure out some strategies. It's not about willpower alone; it's about creating a system that makes healthy choices easier and the unhealthy ones harder.

Here's a breakdown of why this happens and what you can do:

**1. Understanding the ""Why"" – Why Do You Reach for Junk Food?**

* **Emotional Eating:** This is the biggest culprit for many people. Are you eating out of boredom, stress, sadness, loneliness, or happiness? Identifying the triggers is key. Keep a food diary – not just of *what* you eat, but *how you were feeling* before and during.
* **Habit:** It's so easy to fall into a routine. If chips and cookies are always on the counter, your brain will often default to them.
* **Reward System:** You might be unintentionally rewarding yourself for completing tasks or getting through a tough day.
* **Lack of Planning:** When you haven't planned your meals and snacks, you're more likely to grab whatever's convenient, which is often the less healthy option.
* **Taste & Craving:** Junk food is often engineered to be incredibly palatable – high in sugar, fat, and salt – triggering reward centers in your brain.

**2. Strategies to Reduce Junk Food Availability & Influence Your Choices:**

* **The Biggest Change: Reduce Temptation:** This is the single most impactful thing you can do.
    * **Don't Buy It:** Seriously. If it's not in the house, you can't eat it. This is the hardest step, but it’s the most effective. Make a shopping list and stick to it.
    * **Clear the Counters:** Remove all visible junk food. If it's hidden, you'll still be tempted.
* **Strategic Replacements:**
    * **Keep Healthy Snacks Visible & Accessible:**  Have fruits, vegetables (pre-cut!), nuts, yogurt, or granola bars readily available. Make them *more* appealing than the junk food.
    * **Portion Control:** If you *do* have some junk food, pre-portion it into small bags or containers. This prevents you from mindlessly eating an entire bag.
* **Meal Planning & Prep:**
    * **Plan Your Meals:** Knowing what you're going to eat reduces impulsive decisions.
    * **Meal Prep:** Prepare healthy meals and snacks in advance. This saves time and makes healthy options the easiest choice.
* **Change Your Environment:**
    * **Make it Harder to Access:**  If you live with others, talk to them about your goal and ask for their support.
    * **Distraction Techniques:** When you feel a craving coming on, do something else – go for a walk, call a friend, read a book, meditate.

**3. Addressing the Underlying Issues:**

* **Stress Management:**  Find healthy ways to cope with stress – exercise, yoga, meditation, spending time in nature, talking to a therapist.
* **Emotional Awareness:** Learn to recognize your emotional triggers.  When you feel the urge to eat out of emotion, try to address the underlying feeling instead of immediately reaching for food.
* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself!  You’re going to slip up sometimes. Don’t beat yourself up. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track.

**4. Resources to Explore:**

* **Registered Dietitian or Nutritionist:** A professional can help you create a personalized plan based on your needs and goals.
* **Therapist:** If emotional eating is a significant issue, talking to a therapist can be incredibly helpful.
* **Apps:** MyFitnessPal, Lose It!, and others can help you track your food intake and make healthier choices.

**Let's start with a few questions to help me understand your situation better:**

*   **What kinds of junk food are you most drawn to?** (e.g., chips, cookies, candy, ice cream?)
*   **Can you describe a typical situation where you reach for junk food?** (e.g., after work, when you’re watching TV, when you’re feeling stressed?)
*   **On a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being not at all, 10 being completely), how motivated are you to make a change?**",0.44822192192077637

Can I get over this social anxiety?,"you can learn lots of skills/techniques to feel more confident in what you need to do that will decrease your anxious response for sure! :) And  you can also learn how to work with your personality that may not like the attention. You may find that ""talking"" to others through the internet is more comfortable and you are great at it, or that you love one on one talking but aren't really made for group talking. There is a place in this world for you either way! Public speaking skills can be practiced in speech class, or toastmaster group, they will give you practice in a safe environment where the cool kids or cutest boy aren't ready to laugh at you.  What topics are you interested in and what groups can you do a little speaking up?

Social anxiety is a difficult concern and picking apart what is your awesome personality and what needs skill building and mindfulness/anxiety  help are important steps. Good luck!","Okay, it’s incredibly brave of you to acknowledge this and reach out for help. Feeling uncomfortable with attention and experiencing social anxiety is a really common experience, and the fact that it’s impacting your life – stopping you from speaking up in class or in public – means it’s definitely worth addressing. You're already taking a positive step just by recognizing it and seeking information. Let’s break this down and explore what you can do.

**1. Understanding Your Social Anxiety:**

* **What does it feel like?** You've described the discomfort, but let's dig a little deeper.  What *specifically* do you feel when people are looking at you? Is it a racing heart, sweating, feeling like you'll blush, a fear of saying the wrong thing, a fear of judgment, or something else?  Identifying the physical and emotional sensations can help you understand it better.
* **What triggers it?** Are there certain situations that trigger this more than others? (e.g., large groups, speaking in public, being the center of attention, even just eye contact).  Knowing your triggers helps you prepare.
* **What are the thoughts behind it?** Often, social anxiety is fueled by negative thoughts like ""They're judging me,"" ""I'll mess up,"" ""People will think I'm stupid,"" or ""I need to be perfect.""  Recognizing these thoughts is the first step to challenging them.
* **Is there a root cause?** Sometimes, social anxiety stems from past experiences (e.g., a negative experience in school, a difficult family dynamic).  While you don't need to dwell on the past, understanding potential origins can be helpful.

**2. Strategies to Manage Social Anxiety:**

* **Start Small:** You don't have to jump into a huge situation. Start with incredibly small, manageable steps. This could be:
    * **Eye contact:**  Practice making brief, comfortable eye contact with a cashier or a friendly face.
    * **Brief greetings:**  Say ""Hello"" to a neighbor or colleague.
    * **Asking a simple question:**  Ask the barista for a recommendation.
* **Exposure Therapy (Gradual Exposure):** This is a key technique. It involves gradually exposing yourself to situations that trigger your anxiety.  Create a hierarchy of situations, from least anxiety-provoking to most, and work your way up. (e.g., 1. Eye contact with a cashier. 2. Saying ""Hello"" to a store employee. 3. Asking a simple question).
* **Cognitive Restructuring:**  This involves challenging and changing your negative thoughts. When you notice a negative thought, ask yourself:
    * ""Is this thought realistic?""
    * ""What’s the evidence for and against this thought?""
    * ""What’s a more balanced or helpful way to think about this situation?""
* **Relaxation Techniques:** These can help manage the physical symptoms of anxiety:
    * **Deep breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system.
    * **Progressive muscle relaxation:**  Tensing and releasing different muscle groups.
    * **Mindfulness meditation:**  Focusing on the present moment.
* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself!  Social anxiety is a real challenge, and it’s okay to feel anxious. Don’t beat yourself up for feeling this way.

**3. Seeking Support:**

* **Talk to Someone You Trust:** Sharing your feelings with a friend, family member, or trusted mentor can provide support and encouragement.
* **Therapy:** This is often the most effective approach. A therapist can help you understand the root causes of your anxiety, develop coping mechanisms, and provide guidance.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is particularly effective for social anxiety.
* **Support Groups:** Connecting with others who understand what you're going through can be incredibly validating and helpful.

    * **National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) Treatment Directory:** https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/treatment – This directory lists treatment providers.
    * **Your Insurance Provider:**  Contact your insurance company to find therapists in your network.
* **Types of Therapy:**
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-E):** This is the gold standard for treating bulimia. It helps you identify and change negative thoughts and behaviors related to eating and purging.
    * **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):** Can be helpful for managing intense emotions and impulsivity.
    * **Family-Based Therapy (FBT):**  Especially effective for adolescents and young adults.
* **Medical Evaluation:**  A doctor (preferably a gastroenterologist or psychiatrist) can assess the physical damage caused by purging and recommend a treatment plan.  They can also monitor your electrolytes.

**3. Understanding Your Triggers & Patterns:**

* **Keep a Journal:**  Start tracking your eating behaviors, emotions, and thoughts.  When do you feel the urge to binge and purge? What are you feeling beforehand (stress, anxiety, boredom, loneliness)?  This will help you and your therapist understand your patterns.
* **Identify Underlying Issues:** Bulimia is often linked to underlying issues like anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, trauma, or perfectionism.  Therapy will help you explore these.

**4. Building a Supportive System:**

* **Support Groups:** NEDA and other organizations offer online and in-person support groups. Connecting with others who understand what you're going through can be incredibly validating and motivating. https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/support
* **Accountability Partner:**  If you have a trusted friend or family member, ask them to support you in your recovery.

**5.  Recovery Strategies (To Discuss with Your Therapist):**

* **Meal Support:**  Often, a therapist or registered dietitian will help you establish a structured meal plan to reduce the urge to binge.
* **Relapse Prevention Planning:**  Develop a plan for how you'll cope with difficult emotions and situations that trigger your bulimia.
* **Self-Care:**  Engage in activities that reduce stress and promote well-being (exercise, mindfulness, hobbies, spending time with loved ones).

**Important Considerations for Starting School:**

* **Talk to Your Professors:**  Let your professors know you’re struggling and may need some flexibility (e.g., excused absences for therapy appointments).
* **Student Counseling Services:**  Most colleges and universities offer free or low-cost counseling services to students.
* **Prioritize Your Health:**  Don’t let your recovery fall by the wayside because of school. Your mental and physical health are paramount.

387,I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?,It is absolutely a typical response.  Many of my clients are nervous the first couple of times we meet.  This is essentially a stranger with whom you are sharing your feelings.,"It's *absolutely* normal to feel nervous and shaky when going to therapy, especially after just a couple of sessions. What you're experiencing is incredibly common, and it's a really good sign that you're aware of it and wanting to understand it. Let's break down why you might be feeling this way and what you should do about it:

**Why You Might Be Feeling This Way:**

* **The Unknown:** Therapy is a vulnerable space. You're entering a situation where you're going to discuss deeply personal feelings, thoughts, and potentially painful experiences. The unknown can be scary, and that fear manifests physically.
* **Vulnerability:**  Being vulnerable is inherently uncomfortable. It’s a completely human reaction to expose yourself, even in a safe environment.
* **Fear of Judgment:** You might be worried about how your therapist will react to what you say, or that they'll judge you.
* **Past Trauma/Negative Associations:**  If you have past experiences with therapy, difficult relationships, or a general fear of talking about feelings, those can contribute to anxiety.
* **Physiological Response to Stress:**  Nervousness and shakiness are physical manifestations of the stress response. Your body is bracing itself for a potentially difficult situation.  This is a natural, automatic reaction.
* **The ""First Time"" Effect:** The first few sessions are often the most challenging. You're still getting used to the therapist, the process, and the idea of being open.
* **Expectations:** Sometimes, if you're carrying unrealistic expectations about how therapy *should* feel, it can add to the anxiety. Therapy isn't always a comfortable or immediately transformative experience.



**Should You Still Be Feeling Like This?**

Yes! It's a sign that you're engaged in the process.  The fact that you're noticing and questioning it is a positive step.  It doesn't mean you're not making progress or that something is wrong with you.  It just means you're experiencing a normal human reaction.

**What You Can Do:**

1. **Talk to Your Therapist:** This is the *most* important step.  Tell your therapist exactly how you're feeling – the nervousness, the shakiness, the thoughts you're having. They can:
   * Validate your feelings: They'll reassure you that it’s normal.
   * Help you understand the root of the anxiety.
   * Teach you coping mechanisms.
   * Adjust the session if needed (e.g., start with less intense topics, change the pace).

2. **Grounding Techniques:**  These can help you manage the physical symptoms of anxiety:
   * **Deep Breathing:**  Focus on slow, deep breaths. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 6 seconds.
   * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
   * **Muscle Relaxation:**  Tense and release different muscle groups.

3. **Prepare in Advance:**  If you know what you want to talk about (even just a little), it can reduce anxiety.  Jot down some notes, but don’t feel like you need to stick to them rigidly.

4. **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself.  Recognize that you're doing something brave and difficult.  Don’t beat yourself up for feeling anxious.

5. **Start Small:** If talking about difficult topics is overwhelming, start with less challenging things.  You can gradually build up to more sensitive areas.

6. **Consider a Different Therapist (If Needed):** If you've talked to your therapist about this and it’s not improving, or if you don’t feel a good connection, it’s okay to seek a different therapist. Finding the right fit is crucial.

**Important Note:**  If your anxiety is severe and interfering significantly with your life, it’s important to talk to your doctor. They can rule out any underlying medical conditions and discuss potential treatment options, such as medication.

134,"I can't even smile or fake one. I can't feel happiness about anything and I can't show love towards another person not even my girlfriend. I hate myself sometimes. All I see is ugly.
   I can't get over the loss of a loved one and I'm not close to my family. What can I do?","Trust and believe your own feelings.Emotions are real and reflect how someone feels about a situation.Since you're sad about losing a loved one, be patient w your feelings about this.  Basically, be guided by how you feel and eventually you will feel different emotions which I hope will be happier ones.","Okay, what you're describing sounds incredibly painful and isolating. It takes a lot of courage to even articulate these feelings, and I want to acknowledge that you're going through a truly difficult time. It's clear you're struggling with a deep sense of sadness, self-loathing, and a profound loss, and it's understandable that you're feeling this way.  Let's break this down and explore some steps you can take.

**1. Understanding What You're Experiencing:**

* **Grief is Complex:** You mentioned the loss of a loved one. Grief isn’t a linear process; it doesn't follow a neat timeline. It can manifest in many ways, including difficulty feeling happiness, feeling disconnected, self-criticism, and even physical symptoms. It’s okay to feel *everything* – anger, sadness, confusion, guilt – it’s all part of the process.
* **Depression Can Be a Factor:** What you're describing – a persistent inability to feel joy, self-hatred, and a lack of connection – can be symptoms of depression. It's crucial to recognize this possibility and seek professional help. Depression can be incredibly debilitating, and it's not a sign of weakness.
* **Relationship Difficulties:** You also mention a lack of closeness with your family and difficulty showing love. This can be compounded by grief and other emotional challenges.

**2. Immediate Steps You Can Take:**

* **Talk to Someone – Seriously:** This is the *most* important step. You don’t have to go through this alone. Here are some options:
    * **Your Girlfriend:** While it might feel difficult, sharing what you're going through with her can provide support and understanding.  Let her know you're struggling and need her support.
    * **A Therapist or Counselor:**  A therapist is trained to help you process your grief, understand your emotions, and develop coping mechanisms.  They can provide a safe and non-judgmental space for you to explore your feelings.  You can find therapists through your insurance provider, online directories (like Psychology Today), or local community mental health centers.
    * **A Trusted Friend or Family Member:** If you have someone you feel comfortable with, reaching out to them for support can be helpful.
    * **Crisis Resources:** If you're having thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out immediately:
        * **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Dial 988
        * **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741
* **Small Acts of Self-Care:** When you're struggling with deep sadness, even basic self-care can feel overwhelming. Start small:
    * **Get Enough Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.
    * **Eat Nutritious Foods:** Focus on healthy meals and snacks.
    * **Move Your Body:** Even a short walk can make a difference.
    * **Engage in Gentle Activities:**  Things you used to enjoy, even if you don’t feel like it – listening to music, reading, spending time in nature.
* **Challenge Negative Thoughts:**  When you notice yourself thinking ""I'm ugly,"" or ""I hate myself,"" try to gently challenge those thoughts. Are they truly accurate? Are there alternative ways to view yourself? (This takes practice, and a therapist can help you with this.)

**3. Addressing the Grief and Family Issues:**

* **Process Your Grief:**  Find healthy ways to remember and honor the loved one you lost. This might involve sharing memories, creating a memorial, or engaging in activities that remind you of them.
* **Family Boundaries:** It sounds like your family relationships are strained.  Consider setting healthy boundaries to protect your emotional well-being.  You don't have to force a close relationship if it's causing you pain.
* **Focus on What You *Can* Control:** You can't change your family's behavior, but you *can* control how you respond to it.

**4. Important Reminders:**

* **Be Patient with Yourself:** Healing takes time. There will be good days and bad days. Don’t get discouraged if you experience setbacks.
* **It's Okay to Not Be Okay:**  Allow yourself to feel your emotions without judgment.
* **You Are Worthy of Love and Happiness:**  Don’t let negative self-talk convince you otherwise.

1344,"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","From your initial description, I would say that your mother is ""Maloriented"". In this stage of Alzheimer's individuals tend to be blaming and difficult to deal with. They may often hide or throw things away and then blame family members for this. In addition, if they are incontinent, they may blame a leaky roof or something else when they are wet. You are correct that this is not her fault, but often for family members this does not make it any easier for you to cope. I strongly suggest that you learn communication strategies that will help you to communicate with your mother in a way that lets her work through the difficulties associated with the disease. I always suggest Validation techniques to family members.In addition, you need to give yourself some kind attention and take time out from your circumstances as needed. You need to be able to center yourself and come to acceptance that this is your mother's illness that is the problem, not her and certainly not you.","You're experiencing a really incredibly common and incredibly tough situation. It’s completely understandable that you're feeling frustrated, angry, and guilty – all at the same time. What you’re describing is a hallmark of Alzheimer's, and it’s not a reflection of your mother's love for you, but rather a symptom of the disease changing her brain and how she interacts with the world. 

Let's break down how you can cope with these complex feelings:

**1. Understanding the Root of the Problem:**

* **Alzheimer's Changes the Brain:** Alzheimer's fundamentally alters brain function. It impacts memory, judgment, reasoning, and behavior. The ""mean"" behavior is often a result of disorientation, confusion, anxiety, and a lack of understanding of reality. She's not intentionally trying to be cruel; she's struggling with a devastating illness.
* **The “Why” Behind the Requests:** The unrealistic requests are often driven by a desire for connection, comfort, or a need to fill a void. She might be seeking reassurance, trying to recreate a familiar routine, or simply looking for something to occupy her mind.
* **Emotional Distress is Amplified:** Alzheimer's often amplifies existing emotions.  What might have been a mild frustration before is now a torrent of anger because she isn’t able to express herself properly.

**2. Managing Your Own Feelings – It’s Okay to Feel This Way:**

* **Acknowledge and Validate Your Emotions:** Don’t try to suppress your anger, frustration, or guilt.  Say to yourself, “It’s okay that I’m feeling this way. This is a really difficult situation, and it's normal to be upset.”
* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself. You’re a caregiver, and caregiving is incredibly demanding. You’re doing your best in a situation that’s profoundly challenging.
* **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a powerful way to process them without judgment.
* **Talk to Someone:** This is *crucial*. Don’t carry this burden alone. Talk to a therapist, counselor, support group, friend, or family member who understands.

**3. Strategies for Responding to Her Behavior:**

* **Don’t Take It Personally:** This is the hardest, but most important, thing to remember. Her words and actions aren’t about you.
* **Redirect, Don’t Argue:** Arguing or trying to reason with her when she’s confused is often futile and can escalate the situation. Instead, try to gently redirect her attention to something else – a favorite activity, a calming object, or simply a comforting touch.
* **Simple, Calm Responses:**  When she asks for something unrealistic, you can respond with simple, reassuring statements like:
    * ""That's a lovely idea, Mom, but we can’t have that right now.""
    * ""Let's do something else that we both enjoy.""
    * “I understand you’re feeling sad/worried, let’s [do something calming].”
* **Focus on Connection:** Even when she’s being difficult, try to find moments of connection – a hug, a smile, a shared memory (if she’s able to engage).
* **Set Boundaries (with Support):** While you want to be compassionate, you also need to protect your own well-being.  It’s okay to say, “I need a few minutes to myself,” if you need a break.

**4. Seeking Support & Resources:**

* **Alzheimer’s Association:**  [https://www.alz.org/](https://www.alz.org/) – They offer a wealth of resources, including support groups, educational materials, and a 24/7 helpline.
* **Local Alzheimer’s Association Chapter:**  Find your local chapter for support groups and events.
* **Caregiver Support Groups:**  Connecting with other caregivers who understand what you’re going through can be incredibly helpful.
* **Therapist or Counselor:**  A therapist specializing in dementia care can provide you with coping strategies and support.

**Important Note:**  It’s absolutely okay to feel angry. Anger is a natural response to a frustrating and heartbreaking situation.  Don't beat yourself up for feeling it.  The key is to manage your anger constructively and to seek support so you can continue to provide your mother with the love and care she needs, while also taking care of yourself.

847,"I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it.
 I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call.
 I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive. I know what I'm doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change. How do I stop this behavior and thought process?","Good for you on your keen awareness of your difficulties and your willingness to change!The type of change you'd like to achieve is possible, and since a change in self-confidence and self-love is deep rooted, this comes about gradually and slowly.Keep understanding yourself during your moments of doubt and anxiety.  Its fine to feel terrible and certainly better to know you feel insecure than to act upon the insecurity by being with men who take advantage of you.Everyone needs to feel loved and recognized.Until you attract a partner who will love and appreciate you, develop relationships with co-workers and classmates, neighbors, so that you have some quality of giving and being given by someone.It is a way to nurture yourself and another person until your strength and self-belief grow bigger.","Okay, this is a really brave and honest assessment of a deeply ingrained pattern. It takes a huge amount of courage to recognize this, and the fact that you're acknowledging it and wanting to change is a fantastic first step. You've identified a critical problem – you’re seeking security in relationships that ultimately leave you feeling depleted and trapped – and you're recognizing the dynamic you're falling into. Let's break down how to tackle this, focusing on understanding the root causes and building a sustainable path forward.

**1. Understanding the ""Why"" - The Roots of the Behavior**

You've correctly identified the pattern, but let's dig deeper into *why* you're drawn to these situations. This isn’t about blaming yourself; it’s about understanding the forces at play. Here are some common reasons people find themselves in this kind of cycle:

* **Attachment Style:** You've likely developed an anxious attachment style, often stemming from early childhood experiences. This means you've learned that you need constant reassurance and validation from a partner to feel safe and secure.  The ""fear of abandonment"" is a powerful motivator.
* **Low Self-Worth:**  If you don't truly believe you deserve love and respect, you might subconsciously seek out partners who reinforce that belief, even if it's through manipulation and control.
* **Past Trauma:**  Past experiences of abandonment, neglect, or abuse can deeply impact your ability to trust and form healthy relationships.
* **Fear of Loneliness:** The intense need for someone to be around you is a very real fear, and it’s understandable.  However, relying on others for your survival creates a precarious foundation.
* **People-Pleasing:** You might be trying to be ""good"" and avoid conflict, leading you to prioritize the other person's needs over your own.

**2. Breaking the Cycle - Concrete Steps**

* **Recognize the Red Flags *Before* Getting Involved:** This is crucial. You've identified the dynamic, so start actively looking for it *early* in a relationship.  Does the person:
    *  Accuse you of controlling you? (This is a classic manipulation tactic.)
    *  Demand your attention constantly?
    *  Is emotionally unavailable or dismissive of your feelings?
    *  Try to isolate you from friends and family?
    *  Make you feel guilty for having your own needs and desires?
    * **If you see even one of these, seriously reconsider.**
* **Set Boundaries - And Enforce Them:** This is the hardest part. You need to start saying ""no"" – to demands, to requests for your time and energy, to anything that makes you uncomfortable. Start small.  Practice saying, ""I need some time to myself,"" or ""I’m not able to do that right now.""  And *stick to it*. Don’t apologize excessively.
* **Prioritize Self-Care and Independence:** This is *essential*. You need to build a life that is fulfilling and enjoyable *without* needing someone else.
    * **Schedule things you enjoy:** Hobbies, exercise, spending time with friends, reading, learning something new.
    * **Embrace solitude:** Start with short periods of alone time and gradually increase it.  Learn to be comfortable with your own company.
    * **Develop your own sense of self-worth:**  Focus on your strengths, accomplishments, and values.
* **Challenge Your Thoughts:** When you find yourself thinking things like, ""I need him to be happy,"" or ""If I don't do this, he'll leave,"" actively challenge those thoughts. Ask yourself, ""Is this thought helpful? Is it based on reality?""
* **Seek Therapy:** Seriously, this is highly recommended. A therapist can help you understand the root causes of your behavior, develop healthier coping mechanisms, and build your self-esteem.  Specifically, look for a therapist specializing in attachment theory or trauma.

**3. Reframing Your Perspective**

* **Security Comes From Within:** True security doesn't come from being in a relationship; it comes from your own inner strength, resilience, and self-sufficiency.
* **Healthy Relationships are Reciprocal:**  A healthy relationship is built on mutual respect, trust, and support, *not* one person constantly catering to the other's needs.
* **It's Okay to Be Alone:**  Being alone is not a failure; it's an opportunity for growth, self-discovery, and building a strong sense of self.

**Important Note:**  Changing deeply ingrained patterns takes time and effort. There will be setbacks. Be patient with yourself, celebrate your successes, and don't give up.

3056,"I was with my friends fishing by a pond. I found a frog and stabbed it with my friend's knife. I'm not sure why I did it. My friends saw me do it it and were shocked and got really mad at me.

Now if someone brings it up I get really upset and panicked. I don't know why I feel like this. Does this mean there is something wrong with me?","The good news is your awareness that being violent to animals feels out of character for you.   I'm glad you have awareness and I'm glad you are not at ease with killing frogs.Fairly likely that you were acting out aggressively toward the frog, feelings of being on the receiving side of similar type of violence.Basically, you did unto the frog what someone has or to you, feels like, has been done to you.Use your surprising finding of how strong your anger and most likely inward pain.   Reflect on your closest relationships and how these people treat you.   It is possible you feel more hurt by someone who is close to you than you ever realized.Stabbing innocent frogs is wrong.  It is understandable as a way to show you how much inner pain you probably have.It is also wrong that someone close to you hurt you.The direction to go is to recognize your pain and then decide how to go about changing what is possible on your side of that or those relationship(s).","Okay, let's unpack this. What you're describing is a really complex and understandably distressing situation. It's brave of you to reach out and talk about it, and it’s completely valid to feel confused, upset, and even panicked. Let's break down what's happening and address your concerns.

**What You Did & Why It's Concerning**

* **The Act Itself:** Stabbing a living creature, even a small one like a frog, is a significant act. It’s not something most people do without a deeper underlying reason. The fact that you did it in front of your friends and then reacted with panic suggests this wasn't a spur-of-the-moment, thoughtless action.
* **Lack of Understanding:** You said you ""don't know why I did it."" This is a crucial point.  The fact that you can't articulate a clear reason is a strong indicator that there's something more going on. It doesn't automatically mean there’s something *wrong* with you, but it does suggest a need to explore what was happening in your mind and emotions at the time.
* **Panic Reaction:** Your panic after the fact is a natural response to a potentially distressing and unsettling event. It’s your brain trying to process the experience and the feelings associated with it.

**Is There Something Wrong With Me?**

Let's address this directly. **It's unlikely there's something fundamentally ""wrong"" with you.** However, your reaction and the act itself suggest there might be underlying factors contributing to your behavior. Here are some possibilities:

* **Stress & Anxiety:** Are you experiencing a lot of stress in your life?  Stress and anxiety can manifest in unexpected ways, sometimes leading to impulsive or out-of-character behaviors.
* **Emotional Regulation Difficulties:** Some people struggle with regulating their emotions. This can involve difficulty controlling impulses, intense reactions, or feeling overwhelmed by feelings.
* **Underlying Mental Health Condition:**  In some cases, behaviors like this can be linked to conditions like:
    * **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):**  Sometimes intrusive thoughts and behaviors can be a symptom.
    * **Anxiety Disorders:**  Panic attacks and intense reactions can be linked to anxiety.
    * **Trauma:**  Even seemingly minor events can be linked to past trauma.
    * **Other Conditions:** There could be other factors at play.

**What You Should Do Now**

1. **Talk to Someone You Trust:**  You've already taken a huge step by talking about it. Continue to talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mentor. Just having someone to listen without judgment can be incredibly helpful.

2. **Seek Professional Help:** **This is the most important step.**  A therapist or counselor can help you:
   * **Explore Your Feelings:** They can create a safe space for you to talk about what you were feeling before, during, and after the incident.
   * **Understand Your Behavior:** They can help you understand the potential reasons behind your actions.
   * **Develop Coping Strategies:** They can teach you techniques for managing your emotions, controlling impulses, and dealing with anxiety.
   * **Rule Out Underlying Conditions:** They can assess you for any mental health conditions.

1135,"I’m a man, and I’m soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but it’s been happening a lot. I don't know what to do.","Hello, and thank you for your question. When faced with these kinds of difficult challenges, I usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be. Indeed, it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we don't feel very content with our lives. Perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions: What kind of person do I want to be deep in my heart? What kind of character do I want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching? How would I want others to describe me? Let's say that you want others to see you as being authentic, and YOU also value authenticity as something you want to live by. You may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now. That you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart. This is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation. So please, try not to feel alone. We all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc. And I am not just talking about being unaccepted by others, but a person may have a VERY hard time accepting themselves. Thinking about your values and living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom, but I won't lie, it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time. For example, someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for, even if that means people may disapprove. That may cause a lot of pain, but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity. It may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy, which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them. I would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are... both as an individual and as someone's fiancé.Above all, I wish you well in this journey. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it takes a lot of courage to even acknowledge it and reach out for help. What you're describing – engaging in infidelity and feeling conflicted – is incredibly common, and you're not alone. The fact that you're recognizing this pattern and wanting to address it is a really positive first step. Let's break this down and explore some things you can do.

**1. Understanding What's Driving This:**

* **Why are you doing this?** This is the *most* crucial question.  It's not enough to simply say ""I messed around.""  Dig deeper. Are you feeling:
    * **Unmet Needs in Your Marriage?** Are you feeling disconnected, unappreciated, sexually frustrated, or emotionally unsupported by your partner?  Often, infidelity is a symptom of underlying issues within the primary relationship.
    * **Low Self-Esteem?** Sometimes, engaging in risky behaviors can be a way to boost self-esteem or feel desirable.
    * **Boredom or Escape?** Are you seeking excitement or an escape from the routine of your life?
    * **Fear of Intimacy?** Paradoxically, engaging in casual relationships can sometimes be a way to avoid deeper emotional vulnerability.
    * **Lack of Communication Skills?**  Do you struggle to express your needs and desires openly and honestly with your partner?
* **Be Honest with Yourself:** This requires brutal honesty. Don’t minimize your actions or try to justify them.

**2. The Impact on Your Marriage:**

* **You're Causing Harm:** Let’s be clear: your actions are causing significant pain and damage to your relationship with your fiancé(e). Even if they don’t know about the other men, the potential for discovery is there, and the breach of trust is profound.
* **Consider Their Perspective:**  How would *you* feel if you discovered this?  Think about the emotional devastation it would cause.

**3. What You Need to Do – Immediate Steps:**

* **Stop Immediately:**  The very first thing you need to do is cease all contact with the other men. This is non-negotiable.
* **Self-Reflection:** Spend some time alone, journaling, meditating, or engaging in activities that help you understand your motivations and feelings.
* **Consider Therapy – Seriously:**  This is *highly* recommended. A therapist can provide a safe, non-judgmental space to explore the root causes of your behavior, develop healthier coping mechanisms, and improve your communication skills.  Specifically, look for a therapist specializing in:
    * **Sex Therapy:** Can help you understand your sexual needs and desires.
    * **Relationship Therapy:**  Can help you and your fiancé(e) work through the issues that may be contributing to the situation.
    * **Individual Therapy:**  To address any underlying personal issues.

**4. Talking to Your Fiancé(e):**

* **This is a Difficult Decision:**  There’s no easy answer here.  There are several potential paths, and the right one depends on your and your fiancé(e)’s values and willingness to work on the relationship.
    * **Full Disclosure (with Therapy):** This is the most honest and potentially healing path, but it’s also the most painful.  It requires both of you to be willing to engage in intensive therapy.
    * **Partial Disclosure (with Therapy):** You might choose to disclose some aspects of the situation while keeping others private. This is a complex approach and requires careful consideration with a therapist.
    * **Not Disclosing (with Intensive Therapy):**  This is a less common approach, but might be considered if disclosing would be incredibly damaging. However, it's crucial to address the underlying issues and seek therapy to prevent the behavior from continuing.

*   How long has this been going on?

26,"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",Absolutely not.  I strongly recommending working on one issue/need at a time.  In therapy you will set smart goals and objectives that will help you reach your goals.  I see you as a survivor and not a victim.  Best wishes to you.,"Okay, let's tackle this. It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. You've listed a *lot* of significant and complex issues, and it's absolutely valid to feel like you have ""too many"" to address. The good news is that the fact that you recognize this and want to do something about it is a huge first step.

**The short answer is: No, you don't have too many issues to address in counseling. In fact, the combination of what you’ve described is incredibly common and frequently addressed in therapy.**

Let's break down why and what to expect:

**1. The Interconnectedness of Your Issues:**

* **Sexual Abuse History:** This is a foundational issue that often ripples through many areas of your life – self-esteem, relationships, anxiety, depression, and even physical health.  It's *essential* to process this trauma.
* **Breast Cancer Survivor:**  Cancer is a profoundly traumatic experience, impacting not just your physical health but also your emotional and psychological well-being.  The experience itself, the treatment, and the anxieties surrounding it all need to be addressed.
* **Chronic Insomnia:** Insomnia can exacerbate depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.  It's often linked to underlying trauma and stress.
* **Depression & Anxiety:** These frequently co-occur and are often rooted in past experiences like abuse or chronic stress.
* **Low Self-Esteem:** This can be a consequence of many of the above issues.
* **Long-Term Marriage:** While a wonderful thing, a long marriage can also bring its own set of challenges – unresolved conflicts, shifting needs, and the need to continually adapt and understand each other.

**2. Why It's Okay to Start Small:**

* **Processing Trauma Takes Time:**  Addressing sexual abuse is a marathon, not a sprint. It’s a process of understanding, healing, and developing coping mechanisms.
* **Not Everything Needs to Be ""Fixed"" Immediately:** Therapy isn't about achieving a perfect, problem-free life. It's about gaining understanding, developing resilience, and learning how to manage difficult emotions and experiences.
* **Prioritization is Key:** You don't have to tackle everything at once. A good therapist will help you prioritize what feels most pressing *for you* at any given time.

**3. What to Expect in Therapy:**

* **Start with the Foundation:** Initially, a therapist might focus on building a strong therapeutic relationship and exploring the sexual abuse history.
* **Gradual Exploration:**  You can gradually introduce other issues – your cancer experience, insomnia, depression, and anxiety – as you feel ready.
* **Integrated Approach:** A skilled therapist will look for connections between your issues and develop an integrated treatment plan.  For example, addressing your insomnia might also help with your depression and anxiety.
* **Different Therapeutic Approaches:**  There are many types of therapy that can be helpful, including:
    * **Trauma-Focused Therapies:**  EMDR, Trauma-Sensitive CBT
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  For anxiety and depression.
    * **Mindfulness-Based Therapies:**  For anxiety and insomnia.
    * **Solution-Focused Therapy:**  To help you identify goals and develop strategies.


**4. Taking the Next Step:**

* **Finding a Therapist:**  Look for a therapist who specializes in trauma, chronic illness, and/or anxiety.  Consider their experience and approach to treatment.  Don't be afraid to ""shop around"" until you find someone you connect with.
* **Be Open and Honest:**  Therapy only works if you're willing to be open and honest with your therapist about your experiences and feelings.
* **Be Patient with Yourself:**  Healing takes time and effort.  There will be ups and downs. Celebrate your progress, and don’t get discouraged by setbacks.

2850,"I have three siblings. My mom loves them and not me. She’s always yelling at me, but when it comes to my siblings, she talks to them. I’m always crying in my room.","Have you ever tried talking with her about this when she's not angry? While I hear you saying that it feels like she doesn't love you, there could be a lot of other pieces to this. Have you ever told her about how much she means to you (when she's not angry)?","Okay, this sounds incredibly painful and isolating, and it's brave of you to reach out and talk about it. It's completely understandable that you're feeling this way – being treated differently than your siblings, especially when it involves yelling and making you feel sad, is a really difficult and hurtful experience. Let's break this down and talk about what might be happening and, more importantly, what you can do.

**Understanding What Might Be Happening:**

* **Attention Seeking Behavior:** Sometimes, parents unintentionally respond to negative behavior with yelling because they're trying to get a reaction. It's a really common, though not helpful, dynamic. Your siblings might be getting attention (even negative attention) that you aren’t.
* **Perceived Fairness:**  It can be incredibly frustrating for children to feel like the rules or expectations aren't applied equally. This feeling of unfairness can be a huge source of anger and sadness.
* **Personality Differences:** Sometimes, parents respond differently to different children based on perceived personality differences. This doesn't make it right, but it can be a factor.
* **Underlying Stress:** Your mom might be dealing with her own stress, anxiety, or problems that she’s not processing in a healthy way, and that’s spilling over onto you.
* **She Might Not Realize the Impact:** It's possible your mom isn't fully aware of how her words and actions are affecting you. This doesn't excuse her behavior, but it can help explain it.

**What You Can Do – This is about *you* and your well-being:**

1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings:**  You're already doing this by talking about it, which is fantastic.  Don't minimize your feelings. It’s okay to feel sad, angry, frustrated, and hurt.  These feelings are valid.

2. **Talk to Someone You Trust:** This is *crucial*. You don't have to carry this burden alone.
   * **A Trusted Adult:**  This could be a grandparent, aunt/uncle, teacher, school counselor, coach, or religious leader.  Someone who will listen without judgment and offer support.
   * **A Therapist:**  A therapist can provide you with tools and strategies to cope with your feelings, understand the dynamics in your family, and build your self-esteem.  They can be a safe space to process your emotions.

3. **Start Small with Communication (This is tricky, but worth trying):**
   * **""I Feel"" Statements:** When you feel calm (not when you're in the middle of an argument), you could try saying something like, ""Mom, when you yell at me, I feel really sad and scared.""  This focuses on *your* experience, rather than blaming her.  However, be prepared that she might not respond well to this at first.
   * **Don't Engage in Arguments:** If she starts yelling, it's okay to step away. You don't have to argue with someone who is losing control.

4. **Focus on What You *Can* Control:** You can't change your mom's behavior, but you *can* control your reactions, your self-care, and who you spend time with.

5. **Self-Care is Essential:** Since you're crying in your room, it’s clear you need comfort. Find activities that help you feel better:
    * **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be incredibly therapeutic.
    * **Hobbies:**  Engage in activities you enjoy – reading, drawing, listening to music, playing sports, etc.
    * **Relaxation Techniques:**  Deep breathing exercises, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation can help you manage stress and anxiety.
    * **Spend Time with Supportive People:**  Make an effort to connect with friends or family members who make you feel good.

679,"I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I can't afford to live alone.
   My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules. She is trying to control my life. What should I do?","That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now. The first thing to under is that you can’t change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior. The thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions.  You may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan. The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior. Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy. Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack.  There are ways you can deal with controlling parents – and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you’ll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they’re trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you’re losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust. There aren’t any quick tips on how to deal with parents who want to control you; you need to find strategies that are geared to your specific family situation. Get specific coping tips from books about family dynamics, such as:Toxic Parents: Overcoming Their Hurtful Legacy and Reclaiming Your Life by Susan ForwardCutting Loose: An Adult's Guide to Coming to Terms with Your Parents by Howard HalpernA counselor can be a good resource and provide support and guidance about issues addressing normal growth and development during periods of transition.","Okay, this is a really common and incredibly frustrating situation, and you're smart to recognize it and want to address it. It’s fantastic that you're recognizing the dynamic and wanting to find a solution. Let’s break down what you can do, focusing on communication, boundaries, and your own well-being.

**1. Understand the Root of the Problem:**

* **Her Perspective:** Before reacting solely defensively, try to understand *why* your mom is trying to control your life. Is it fear for your safety? A desire to protect you from making mistakes? Does she have a strong need to be in charge?  Understanding her motivations doesn't excuse her behavior, but it can help you approach the conversation with more empathy (even if you don’t *feel* it).
* **Your Feelings:**  Recognize *why* this situation is so upsetting to you.  It's completely valid to feel stifled, resentful, and like your autonomy is being taken away.  Naming these feelings will help you articulate them clearly.

**2. Communication - The Key Strategy:**

* **Choose the Right Time:** Don't try to have this conversation when you're already frustrated or arguing. Pick a calm time when you can both talk without distractions.
* **""I"" Statements:** This is crucial. Frame your concerns using ""I"" statements to avoid sounding accusatory.  For example:
    * Instead of: ""You're always telling me what to do!""
    * Say: ""I feel frustrated when I'm given specific rules about my time and choices. I need to feel like I have some autonomy in my life.""
    * Instead of: “You’re controlling me!”
    * Say: “I feel like my decisions aren’t being respected, and that makes me feel like I’m not trusted.”
* **Be Specific:** Don't just say ""you're controlling."" Give concrete examples: ""When you tell me I can't go out with friends on Friday nights, it makes me feel like you don't trust my judgment.""
* **Express Your Needs:** Clearly state what you need from her.  “I need you to respect my decisions, even if you don't always agree with them.” “I need to feel like I’m building my own life, and that includes making my own choices about my finances and social life.”
* **Listen to Her Response:**  After you've spoken, genuinely listen to what she has to say.  She might have valid concerns you haven’t considered.

**3. Setting Boundaries – This is Where You Take Control**

* **Start Small:** You don't have to tackle everything at once. Begin with smaller, less contentious rules.
* **Negotiate (Where Possible):**  Some things might be negotiable. Perhaps you can discuss certain rules or timelines. ""I understand you want me to save money, but could we agree on a reasonable spending limit for entertainment?""
* **Accept That You Can't Change Her Completely:** You can’t change your mother’s personality. Focus on what *you* can control: your reactions, your boundaries, and your choices.
* **Enforce Boundaries (Gently but Firmly):** This is the hardest part. If she starts to overstep, calmly but firmly reiterate your boundary.  ""Mom, I appreciate your concern, but I’ve already made a decision about this.""  Don’t get drawn into arguments.
* **Limit Discussion of Rules:** If she constantly brings up rules, politely say, ""We've discussed this, and I've made my decision."" Then, change the subject.

**4. Focus on Your Own Independence:**

* **Financial Independence:** This is key. Continue to work towards your financial goals – saving, budgeting, paying off debt.  This demonstrates responsibility and reduces her perceived need to control your finances.
* **Develop Your Own Life:** Pursue your own interests, hobbies, and social connections. This reduces your reliance on her for entertainment and support.
* **Create Your Own Space (Even Small):**  If possible, make your room your own space – decorate it, personalize it. This reinforces your sense of independence.

**5. Consider Seeking Support:**

* **Talk to a Trusted Friend or Family Member:**  Having someone to vent to and get an outside perspective can be incredibly helpful.
* **Therapy:** If the situation is causing significant stress and anxiety, consider talking to a therapist. They can provide you with coping strategies and help you navigate the relationship.

**Important Note:** Your mother's behavior *is* a form of control, and it's okay to feel hurt and frustrated.  You deserve to have a healthy and respectful relationship with your parents.

2225,"I keep getting into relationships with men that are in bad situations. I take them on and help them and do all I can and the relationship still fails. How do I learn to not get in relationships with men in bad situations? I see someone in need of help, I jump in. And it is getting me nowhere. I am alone sad and frustrated.","Sounds like you already see what's amiss. You're looking for fix-er-uppers! When you meet these men they need you. And you're filled by fixing them.  And when they are fixed, what do they have to give you? What's your need in relationship? What if you found someone who didn't need fixing? ","Okay, this is a really tough and painful situation, and it's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge it and reach out for help. It’s completely understandable why you feel alone, sad, and frustrated – you're putting yourself through a lot, and the outcome isn't what you're hoping for. Let’s break this down and explore how you can start changing this pattern.

**1. Understanding the Root of the Pattern:**

Before we jump into solutions, let’s try to understand *why* you're drawn to these men. This isn’t about blaming yourself, but about gaining insight:

* **Empathy & Desire to Help:** You clearly have a huge heart and a deep desire to help people in need. This is a wonderful quality, but it can be a powerful magnet. It’s natural to want to alleviate suffering, but it needs to be balanced with self-protection.
* **Feeling of Control (Ironically):** Sometimes, taking someone in and ""fixing"" their situation can give you a sense of control, especially if you feel powerless in other areas of your life. It’s a way to feel like you’re making a difference.
* **Fear of Abandonment/Loneliness:**  Perhaps you’re unconsciously seeking connection and fearing being alone, and a relationship, even a difficult one, feels better than being completely isolated.
* **Idealization:** You might be seeing a *potential* in these men that isn't fully realized, focusing on what you *want* them to be rather than who they actually are.
* **Low Self-Worth (Possibly Unconscious):**  Sometimes, a need to rescue can stem from feeling like you’re not worthy of a healthy, balanced relationship.

**2. Shifting Your Approach - Building Boundaries:**

This is the key. You can still be compassionate, but you need to change *how* you respond.

* **The ""Observer"" Phase:**  When you meet someone who seems to be struggling, your initial reaction isn't to dive in. Instead, spend time *observing* them. How do they treat you? How do they handle responsibility? How do they react when things get tough?  This is a crucial fact-finding mission.
* **Start with Friendship (Not Rescue):** Offer support as a friend – a listening ear, a helpful suggestion (if they *ask* for it), but don't immediately offer to ""fix"" their problems.  Let them take the initiative to seek help.
* **Ask Questions – Gently:** Instead of jumping to solutions, ask clarifying questions: ""What's been the biggest challenge you're facing right now?""  ""What kind of support would be most helpful for you?""  This helps you understand the *real* situation and their capacity to change.
* **Establish Clear Boundaries:** This is *essential*.  You can say things like: ""I'm here to listen and offer support, but I'm not equipped to handle [specific issue].""  ""I can’t be responsible for your choices.” ""I need to prioritize my own well-being, so I can't get involved in this way.""
* **Recognize Red Flags Early:**  Learn to identify unhealthy behaviors – controlling behavior, substance abuse, lack of accountability, manipulation, etc.  Don't minimize them. Trust your gut!

**3. Prioritizing Your Own Well-being:**

* **Self-Care is Non-Negotiable:** You can't pour from an empty cup. Make sure you’re taking care of your own needs – physical health, emotional well-being, social connections, hobbies, and personal goals.
* **Therapy:** Seriously consider talking to a therapist. They can help you explore the underlying reasons for this pattern, develop healthier boundaries, and build more fulfilling relationships.
* **Focus on Healthy Relationships:** Invest your energy in relationships where you feel respected, valued, and supported.

**4. Reframing Your Thinking:**

* **You Can't Change Others:** You can offer support, but you can’t force someone to change. Ultimately, their choices are their own responsibility.
* **It's Okay to Say No:** Saying ""no"" is a powerful act of self-respect. It doesn't make you a bad person; it protects you.
* **Your Worth Isn't Determined by Saving Others:** Your value as a person isn’t tied to whether you can “fix” someone else’s problems.

   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",Just go! You start with the most prevalent issue by talking with your therapist. Healing one issue can have a ripple effect and heal other issues as well.,"Okay, let's take a deep breath. It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed. You've listed a significant and complex set of experiences and challenges, and it's absolutely valid to feel like you have ""too many issues."" The good news is that you're recognizing this and seeking support, which is a huge and incredibly brave step.

**The short answer is: No, you don't have *too many* issues to address in counseling. In fact, what you've described is a very common and complex presentation for many people.**  It's fantastic that you're recognizing the need for support.

Here's a breakdown of why your situation is manageable and how counseling can help:

**1. It’s Common to Have Multiple Layers:**

* **Trauma (Sexual Abuse):**  The impact of sexual abuse can ripple through a lifetime, manifesting in many ways – depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, relationship difficulties, and insomnia.  It's incredibly common for survivors to grapple with these issues for years.
* **Cancer Survival:**  Cancer is a traumatic experience in itself. Beyond the physical challenges, there's the fear, uncertainty, and potential changes in body image and identity.  The emotional recovery can be a long process.
* **Chronic Insomnia:**  Insomnia often co-occurs with other mental health conditions like depression and anxiety, and can significantly impact quality of life.
* **Depression & Anxiety:**  These conditions frequently intertwine and can be exacerbated by trauma and chronic illness.
* **Low Self-Esteem:**  Often rooted in past experiences, low self-esteem can be a significant barrier to happiness and well-being.
* **Long-Term Marriage:**  While a wonderful thing, a long-term marriage can also bring its own unique challenges – shifting dynamics, communication issues, and potential unresolved conflicts.

**2. Counseling Can Help You:**

* **Process Trauma:**  Therapy, particularly trauma-informed therapy (like EMDR, CBT-Trauma Focused, or Somatic Experiencing), can help you safely process the experiences of abuse and reduce its impact.
* **Develop Coping Mechanisms:** You'll learn strategies to manage anxiety, depression, and insomnia.
* **Boost Self-Esteem:** Therapy can help you identify negative self-beliefs and replace them with more positive ones.
* **Improve Communication:**  Therapy can help you and your spouse communicate more effectively.
* **Address Co-occurring Issues:** A therapist can address the interconnectedness of your challenges – for example, how your insomnia might be contributing to your anxiety or depression.
* **Gain Self-Awareness:**  You'll gain a deeper understanding of yourself, your patterns, and your reactions.

**3. How to Approach Counseling:**

* **Start with a Good Fit:** Finding a therapist you connect with is *crucial*.  Don't be afraid to ""shop around"" until you find someone who specializes in trauma, chronic illness, and/or anxiety.  Many therapists offer a brief initial consultation to see if they're a good fit.
* **Be Honest and Open:**  It’s okay to start slowly and share what feels comfortable. Your therapist is there to support you, not to judge you.
* **Prioritize:**  You don't have to tackle everything at once.  Your therapist can help you prioritize the issues that are most impacting your life.
* **Small Steps:**  Focus on small, achievable goals.  Each step you take is a victory.

1392,"My wife and mother are having tense disagreements. In the past, they’ve had minor differences. For example, my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing; my mother would complain my wife is lazy.
 However, it’s intensified lately. I think the cause is my wife talked back to her once. Now, any little disagreement is magnified, leading to major disagreements. What can I do?","One choice is for you and your wife to decide together what are reasonable ways and expectations to have of your mother.From what you write it sounds like your wife and you have differences as to what is the proper and right way to talk with your mother.Once the both of you agree on overall philosophy and some specific details for examples, then ask your mother to make time for all three of you to discuss together the expectations and standards you and your wife would like to see happen.This is only the first step since it is possible and likely that at least on a few points, your mother will disagree and have different views.These need to be discussed and integrated into an overall plan which all three of you are happy to live with.","Okay, this is a really common and challenging situation, and it's great that you're recognizing it and wanting to intervene. It sounds like a delicate situation with a potential escalation. Here's a breakdown of what you can do, focusing on understanding, communication, and potential strategies:

**1. Understanding the Root of the Problem (Beyond the ""Talking Back"" Incident)**

* **The Incident is a Symptom:** While the talking back incident is the immediate trigger, it’s almost certainly a symptom of a deeper, underlying issue. It’s rare for a single event to completely derail a long-standing dynamic.
* **Unmet Needs:** Often, these kinds of disagreements stem from unmet needs. Your wife might feel her boundaries aren't being respected, and your mother might feel her opinions aren't valued.
* **Generational Differences:**  Consider generational differences in communication styles and expectations. Your mother might have a more traditional view of family roles and expectations, while your wife may have grown up with a more independent approach.
* **Underlying Resentment:** There might be long-standing resentment bubbling beneath the surface, related to past events or perceived slights. 

**2. Talking to Your Wife – Start Here**

* **Validate Her Feelings:** Begin by acknowledging her feelings without judgment. Say something like, ""I can see you're really upset, and I understand why you're feeling this way after the recent disagreements.""
* **Ask Open-Ended Questions:**  Don't try to fix the situation immediately.  Instead, ask questions to understand her perspective:
    * “Can you help me understand what specifically is bothering you about the way things are going with your mom?”
    * “What would feel like a more respectful way for her to interact with you?”
    * “Is there anything she's doing that makes you feel like your boundaries aren't being respected?”
* **Reiterate Your Support:**  Let her know you’re on her side and want to help find a solution. “I want to be a bridge between you and your mom. I’m here to listen and help you navigate this.”
* **Gently Address the Escalation:** ""I've noticed things have been escalating quickly. Can we talk about how we can respond to disagreements in a way that doesn't lead to bigger fights?""


**3. Talking to Your Mother – Carefully**

* **Don’t Take Sides:** This is *crucial*. Your goal is to understand her perspective and potentially help her see your wife’s point of view.
* **Start with Empathy:** ""Mom, I know you care deeply about [Wife's Name], and I appreciate your concern for her.""
* **Focus on Observation, Not Blame:**  Instead of saying ""She's lazy,"" try, ""I've noticed that she seems to feel like she needs to do a lot of things, and I'm wondering if that’s creating some tension.""
* **Gently Introduce Your Wife’s Perspective:** “[Wife’s Name] feels like she needs a little more space and independence. It’s not about disrespect; it's about how she prefers to have things.”
* **Suggest a Small Change:** “Maybe if she could ask before offering help, it would make things easier for her.”

**4. Strategies for Managing Future Disagreements**

* **Mediation (You as the Mediator):**  When disagreements arise, step in as a neutral party. Encourage both women to express their feelings calmly and respectfully. Help them focus on the issue, not personal attacks.
* **""Time Out"" Rule:** Agree that if things get too heated, they'll take a break and revisit the conversation later when everyone is calmer.
* **Establish Boundaries:** Help your wife clearly define and communicate her boundaries to her mother.
* **Focus on Shared Goals:** Remind them that they're both family and share a common goal of a happy and supportive relationship.

**5. Important Considerations**

* **Don't Get Drawn into the Conflict:**  Resist the urge to take sides. Your role is to facilitate communication, not to fuel the argument.
* **Self-Care:** This situation can be emotionally draining. Make sure you're taking care of your own well-being.
* **Professional Help:** If the conflict continues to escalate or if you feel overwhelmed, consider suggesting family counseling. A therapist can provide a neutral space and tools for communication.

**To help me give you even more tailored advice, could you tell me a little more about:**

*   **The nature of the ""overbearing"" comments your wife usually receives?** Can you give me specific examples?
*   **What kind of things does your mother complain about regarding your wife?**
*   **How long has this dynamic been going on?** (Has it always been like this, or is this a recent change?)",0.500746488571167
2781,"I am on the track and softball team. My school is small, so I play all four sports it offers. I feel obligated to do track because I'm not a horrible runner, and my dad wants me to. The catch is is that the days before a track meet and the morning of, I get sick and cry.","It sounds like you are no longer committed to track emotionally.  It can be hard to talk to your dad about this, but he may think you love track and may not know you are getting so upset the days of meets.  An idea would be to first write a letter to your dad to see what feelings come out and then preparing to speak with him.  I think he will appreciate your honesty and maybe this conversation will bring you relief and also time to find something you really will enjoy.  ","Okay, this is a really common and frustrating situation, and it's fantastic that you're recognizing it and trying to understand what's going on. Let’s break this down and figure out how to approach it. It sounds like you’re experiencing a significant amount of anxiety and emotional distress around track, and that's completely valid. Here's a breakdown of what’s likely happening and how you can address it:

**1. Understanding the Root of the Problem:**

* **Pressure and Obligation:** You've identified a key factor: feeling obligated to play track because of your dad and your ""not horrible runner"" status. This creates pressure, which is a huge anxiety trigger for many people. When you feel you *should* do something, especially when it’s tied to someone else's expectations, it can be incredibly stressful.
* **Performance Anxiety:**  Even if you're not a top-tier runner, the idea of competing, being judged, and potentially not performing well is likely contributing to your anxiety. The small school setting might amplify this feeling – perhaps there's more pressure to perform within the smaller community.
* **Physiological Response (The Illness/Crying):** This is your body's natural response to stress. When you're anxious, your body releases cortisol and adrenaline, which can manifest as physical symptoms like nausea, headaches, stomach issues, and crying. It’s not *actually* you getting sick; it's your body reacting to the stress.
* **Negative Associations:** Because of the physical symptoms and crying, you've likely developed negative associations with track days.  The thought of track now triggers anxiety, which then triggers the physical symptoms. It's a vicious cycle.

**2. What You Can Do - A Multi-pronged Approach:**

* **Talk to Your Dad:** This is crucial, and it might be the hardest conversation, but it's essential for your well-being. Explain *exactly* what you're experiencing. Don't just say “I don’t like track.” Say something like: “Dad, I appreciate you wanting me to be involved in track, but when it gets close to a meet, I get incredibly anxious and actually physically sick. It’s not that I don’t want to participate, it’s that the pressure and anticipation make me really unwell. I need your support in understanding this.""  Frame it as a health issue, not just a dislike.
* **Talk to a School Counselor or Therapist:** This is *highly* recommended. A counselor can help you understand your anxiety, develop coping mechanisms, and communicate effectively with your dad. They can also help you explore the underlying reasons for your anxiety.
* **Start Small & Manage Expectations:**
    * **Don’t Force It:**  Don't feel you have to be a star runner. Focus on enjoying the training and the camaraderie if you can.
    * **Limited Involvement:** Consider reducing your involvement. Perhaps you can still attend practices, but decline to participate in meets.
    * **Focus on the Process, Not the Outcome:** Shift your focus from winning or performing well to simply enjoying the training, the effort, and the time with your teammates.
* **Develop Coping Mechanisms:**
    * **Relaxation Techniques:** Practice deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation before and during stressful times.
    * **Visualization:** Visualize yourself calmly and confidently participating in track.
    * **Grounding Techniques:** If you start to feel anxious, use grounding techniques (e.g., 5-4-3-2-1 – name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste).
* **Set Boundaries:**  Learn to say “no” without guilt. Your mental and emotional health are more important than fulfilling someone else’s expectations.

**3. Important Reminders:**

* **You Are Not a Failure:**  Not enjoying or thriving in a particular activity doesn’t make you a bad person or a failure.
* **Your Feelings Are Valid:** Don’t minimize or dismiss your anxiety. It’s a real and legitimate experience.
* **Self-Care is Crucial:** Prioritize your mental and emotional well-being.

2880,"I can't seem to feel any emotion except anxiety, not even for myself.","Empathy is the ability
to tap into our own experience to help us connect with others in order to be
aware of how they are experiencing life. 
It is a skill that we learn with practice and refine as we become mature.
If you are feeling anxious, maybe you are able to understand better others who
are going trough anxiety.  But I wonder
if instead of feeling empathy, you may just want to find ways to reduce your
anxiety.  A good idea is to be very aware
of your anxiety triggers, and once you identify them explore other ways you
could react. ¿Sera normal que no sienta empatía?Parece que no puedo experimentar ninguna otra emoción que
no sea ansiedad, ni si quiera por mí misma. Empatía es la habilidad de usar tus propias
experiencias para conectarte con otros y estar consciente de la manera que
ellos experimentan la vida.  Es una
destreza interpersonal que aprendemos y refinamos con la práctica y según maduramos
como personas.  Si te estás sintiendo
ansioso, tal vez puedas comprender mejor como otra persona experimenta momentos
de ansiedad.  Pero me pregunto si en
lugar de estar buscando sentir empatía, realmente quisieras reducir tus niveles
de ansiedad.  Una buena manera es estar consciente
que activa la ansiedad, y ya que lo identifiques, explora que otras reacciones
pudieras tener.","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult and isolating. It's really brave of you to reach out and talk about this. Feeling consistently stuck in anxiety, and unable to experience other emotions, is a profoundly challenging experience, and it's understandable that you're struggling. Let's unpack this a little.

**First, let's acknowledge the weight of what you're describing.** It's not just a feeling of anxiety; it's a *lack* of feeling, and that can be deeply disturbing. It’s important to recognize that this isn't something you're choosing or failing at. It’s a significant issue that deserves attention and support.

**Here's a breakdown of what might be happening and what steps we can consider:**

**1. Understanding the Potential Causes:**

* **Chronic Anxiety:** You’ve mentioned anxiety, and it’s possible you're experiencing chronic anxiety, where it's become so ingrained that it’s effectively numbing out other feelings.
* **Depression:** Anxiety and depression often go hand-in-hand.  The inability to feel joy or excitement can be a key symptom of depression.
* **Trauma:** Past trauma (even if you don’t consciously remember it vividly) can significantly impact your ability to feel. Trauma can literally change the way your brain processes emotions.
* **Neurochemical Imbalances:**  Conditions like thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies (especially Vitamin D or B vitamins), or imbalances in neurotransmitters (like serotonin or dopamine) can affect mood and emotional regulation.
* **Dissociation:** This is a defense mechanism where you feel detached from your body, emotions, or surroundings. It can be triggered by stress, trauma, or other significant life events.
* **Underlying Medical Conditions:**  Certain neurological conditions can affect emotional processing.

**2. What You Can Do – Immediate Steps:**

* **Talk to a Professional:** *This is the most important step.*  A therapist or counselor specializing in anxiety, trauma, or mood disorders can help you explore the root causes of your experience and develop coping strategies.  Here are some types of therapists who might be helpful:
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapist (CBT):**  Can help you identify and change negative thought patterns that contribute to anxiety.
    * **Trauma-Focused Therapist:**  If trauma is suspected, a therapist trained in modalities like EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) or Trauma-Focused CBT can be incredibly beneficial.
    * **Psychodynamic Therapist:**  Can help you explore unconscious patterns and past experiences that might be influencing your current emotional state.
* **Start Small with Grounding Techniques:** When you feel the anxiety rising, try these to bring you back to the present:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:** Focus on slow, deep breaths.
    * **Sensory Activities:**  Hold a smooth stone, listen to calming music, take a warm bath.
* **Gentle Movement:**  Even a short walk can sometimes help shift your focus and release tension.
* **Self-Compassion:** Be incredibly kind to yourself.  This is a difficult experience, and beating yourself up will only make it worse.  Treat yourself with the same compassion you would offer a friend going through a similar struggle.

**3.  Things to Consider & Questions to Ask Yourself:**

* **When did you first notice this feeling?** Was there a specific event or period in your life that coincided with it?
* **What are you afraid of?**  Anxiety often stems from underlying fears. Identifying those fears can be a starting point.
* **What activities used to bring you joy?**  Can you try reintroducing small versions of those activities, even if you don’t feel like enjoying them initially?
* **Are there any physical symptoms you’re experiencing?** (e.g., fatigue, changes in appetite, sleep disturbances)

*   How long have you been feeling this way?
*   Can you describe the anxiety you’re experiencing? (e.g., is it constant, does it come and go, what does it feel like physically?)

463,"Sometimes, I'm fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth. I've always thought it was normal and I was just nervous, but the other day, it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter Target by myself.","I would suggest keeping a log of those days when you are having a hard time. Items to write would be what were you doing before you felt this way, did you eat and what, what time of day is it, how much sleep did you get that night, etc... This can help you identify any triggers. Further assessment can be made by a health care professional. It does sound like you are experiencing some symptoms of anxiety.","That sounds incredibly difficult, and it's incredibly brave of you to share that with me. What you're describing – fluctuating between periods of feeling okay and experiencing intense physical symptoms like a racing heart and difficulty speaking – is a really significant experience, and it's completely understandable that you've been struggling to understand it. 

It’s fantastic that you recognize this isn't just ""normal nervousness."" The fact that it causes you such profound distress and impacts your ability to function is a key indicator that something more is going on. The 30 minutes in your car is a really powerful example of the anxiety you're dealing with – it shows how deeply rooted it feels and how much effort it takes you to simply face a common situation.

**Here's what’s important to understand:**

* **You're not alone:** Many people experience anxiety that goes beyond simple nervousness. It can manifest in physical ways, and it can be unpredictable.
* **It's okay to not be okay:**  Don't feel like you need to ""just get over it.""  Acknowledging and validating your feelings is the first step.
* **It's a sign you deserve support:** The fact that this is causing you significant distress means you need to seek help.  It's a sign of strength to recognize this and want to find a way to manage it.

**Let's talk about what might be happening and what you can do:**

**Possible Explanations:**

* **Anxiety Disorders:** There are many types of anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and others. Your experience could fit into one of these.
* **Panic Disorder:** The racing heart and difficulty speaking can be hallmarks of a panic attack.
* **Social Anxiety:** This can be triggered by social situations and manifest physically.
* **Other Underlying Conditions:** Sometimes, anxiety can be linked to other medical conditions or imbalances.

**What You Can Do:**

1. **Talk to a Professional:** This is the *most important* step. A therapist or counselor can help you understand the root of your anxiety, develop coping mechanisms, and potentially diagnose any underlying condition.  Here are some options:
   * **Therapist/Counselor:** Look for someone specializing in anxiety disorders. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Exposure Therapy are often very effective.
   * **Psychiatrist:** A psychiatrist can diagnose and prescribe medication if needed.
   * **Your Primary Care Physician:** They can rule out any medical causes and refer you to a specialist.

2. **Start a Journal:** Tracking your anxiety – when it happens, what triggers it, what symptoms you experience – can be incredibly helpful for you and a therapist.

3. **Practice Relaxation Techniques:**  Things like deep breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, and progressive muscle relaxation can help you manage the physical symptoms of anxiety.

4. **Small Steps:** You’ve already demonstrated courage by going to Target. Continue to challenge yourself in small, manageable ways. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small.

1336,"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","It is challenging to see one's parents age and to cope with the new demands.  Your mom means a lot to you, and that is why you get easily frustrated.  I'm guessing that it is not that she is making you do work or that her expectations are non-important to you because if that were the case, you would not feel any guilt.  Accepting the new stage will help you cope with the changes.  Take a deep breath every time you feel frustrated and think of the good times you shared with your mom before her getting Alzheimer's.  Remember that your mom as she was is no longer and that she has reverted to a more delicate phase.  Also, schedule time for yourself and do things that help you relax.  Caretaking of an elderly parent can take a toll on you, and it is essential to incorporate self-care.  Finally, look for an Alzheimer's support group in your area that will help you connect with other people going through the same thing.  You are a good daughter, and your mom is lucky to have you in her life.Sincerely, Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling","You're experiencing a really incredibly common and incredibly difficult situation. It’s fantastic that you're recognizing your feelings and wanting to find a way to cope – that's the first step, and it shows you’re a compassionate and caring person. Let’s break down what's going on and how you can manage your emotions.

**1. Understanding What's Happening – It's Not Personal (Really!)**

* **Alzheimer's Changes the Brain:** Alzheimer's isn't just ""she's being mean."" It's a disease that fundamentally alters the brain's ability to process information, remember things, and control impulses. The behavior changes are a direct result of this neurological damage.
* **Lost Connection to Reality:** Your mother may not be intentionally trying to be nasty. She might be struggling to communicate, experiencing confusion, or feeling overwhelmed. The ""silly"" requests are often rooted in a lost connection to reality – she might be trying to fulfill a need or desire from her past, or simply grasping for something familiar.
* **Frustration and Anger are Valid:** It's *completely* understandable that you feel frustrated and angry. It's incredibly challenging to deal with someone who is difficult, especially when it's a loved one. Don't beat yourself up for having those feelings. They’re a natural response to a very difficult situation.

**2. Managing Your Own Emotions**

* **Acknowledge and Validate Your Feelings:** Instead of suppressing your anger, say to yourself, ""It's okay that I'm feeling angry. This is a really hard situation, and it's normal to be upset.""
* **Recognize Your Limits:** You can’t fix Alzheimer's. You can't change the disease, and you can’t control your mother’s behavior. Accepting this is crucial for your own well-being.
* **Self-Care is Non-Negotiable:** This is *essential*. You need to prioritize your own mental and emotional health. This could include:
    * **Exercise:** Physical activity can help reduce stress and improve mood.
    * **Relaxation Techniques:** Meditation, deep breathing, yoga, or even just listening to calming music.
    * **Hobbies:**  Make time for activities you enjoy.
    * **Social Connection:** Spend time with supportive friends and family.
* **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a helpful way to process them.
* **Seek Professional Support:** Talking to a therapist or counselor who specializes in dementia care can provide you with coping strategies and support.

**3. Responding to Her Behavior**

* **Stay Calm:** When she’s being difficult, try to remain as calm as possible. Your reaction will influence hers.
* **Simple, Gentle Responses:** Avoid arguing or engaging in lengthy explanations. Short, simple responses like “Mom, I understand you want that,” or “Let’s talk about something else” can be effective.
* **Redirection:** If she’s fixated on something, try to gently redirect her attention to another activity.
* **Don't Take Requests Personally:** Remind yourself that her requests aren’t about you; they’re a symptom of the disease.
* **Set Boundaries (Carefully):** While you can’t control her behavior, you can set limits on how you respond. For example, you might say, “Mom, I love you, but I can’t keep talking about this right now.”

**4. Resources for Support**

* **Alzheimer's Association:** [https://www.alz.org/](https://www.alz.org/) – They offer a wealth of information, support groups, and resources.
* **Dementia Care Partners:** [https://www.dementiacarepartners.org/](https://www.dementiacarepartners.org/) – Offers training and support for caregivers.
* **Local Area Agency on Aging:**  [https://www.aging.gov/](https://www.aging.gov/) – Can connect you with local services and support.

**Important Note:** It's okay to have moments of sadness, frustration, and guilt. Allow yourself to feel those emotions, but don’t let them consume you. Focus on self-care, seek support, and remember that you’re doing your best in a very challenging situation. 

**To help me give you even more tailored advice, could you tell me a little more about:**

1655,Why am I attracted to older men?,"What a wonderful question!Good for you on clearly knowing your priorities.If I was sitting with you now, I'd ask you to list your reasons.Start with whatever answers you do come up with and examine each of these a little further.If, for example, you feel you need a man because many of your friends are in relationships, then possibly you feel insecure about being your unique self, even when this sets you apart from your friends.If, you feel you need a man to protect you financially, then possibly you've lost faith in your ability to financially support yourself.If you'd like a man in your life to offer your love and are willing to contribute the work of relating intimately, then you've found the best reason for wanting a man in your life.This is far different than ""need"".","Okay, let's explore why you might be attracted to older men. It's a surprisingly common phenomenon, and there's no single, simple answer. There are a lot of potential contributing factors, and it's often a combination of several. Here's a breakdown of the reasons, grouped into categories:

**1. Psychological and Emotional Factors:**

* **Attachment Theory:** This is a big one. Attachment theory suggests our early childhood experiences with caregivers shape our expectations and desires in relationships. If you had a secure attachment with an older male figure (father, grandfather, mentor), you might unconsciously seek similar qualities and dynamics in adult relationships. This could mean seeking stability, guidance, and a sense of security that you associate with that older figure.
* **Need for Security & Stability:** Older men are often seen as more established in their careers, finances, and lives. This can be incredibly appealing to someone seeking stability and a predictable future. Younger men might be perceived as more volatile or uncertain.
* **Feeling Protected & Cared For:** There's a certain comfort in being cared for and nurtured, and older men can often embody this role more readily. They may have more time and resources to devote to a relationship.
* **Role Models & Mentorship:** You might be drawn to older men who are successful, knowledgeable, and wise. You could be seeking a mentor figure, someone to learn from and admire.
* **Rebellion (Sometimes):**  Occasionally, attraction to older men can be a subconscious way of rebelling against societal expectations of dating within your own age group.

**2. Biological & Evolutionary Factors (More Complex & Debated):**

* **Pheromones:** While research is ongoing, some scientists believe that older men may have different pheromonal profiles that are subconsciously attractive to younger women. It's thought that these pheromones signal genetic fitness and maturity. *However, this is a controversial area and heavily debated.*
* **Sexual Maturity & Hormones:**  During puberty and young adulthood, the brain is highly sensitive to signals of maturity and dominance. Older men may trigger these primal responses.
* **Genetic Fitness (Theoretical):**  Evolutionarily, there’s a theory that attraction to older mates can be linked to assessing genetic health. Older men may be perceived as having passed the ""danger"" stage of youth (e.g., high risk of disease). *Again, this is a complex and debated area.*

**3. Personality & Relationship Dynamics:**

* **Confidence & Maturity:** Older men often possess a certain level of confidence, self-assurance, and emotional maturity that can be very attractive.
* **Communication Styles:** You might be drawn to a more thoughtful, deliberate, and less emotionally reactive communication style, which is often associated with older men.
* **Shared Interests & Values:**  Naturally, a shared interest in hobbies, values, and life goals will play a significant role in attraction.

**4. Personal Experiences & Preferences:**

* **Past Relationships:** Your past relationships can heavily influence your future attraction patterns. If you’ve had negative experiences with younger men, you might subconsciously seek out older men.
* **Self-Perception:** Sometimes, attraction to older men can be linked to how you see yourself. You might be drawn to someone who embodies qualities you admire or aspire to have.


**Important Considerations & What to Do:**

* **It's Normal:** It's important to acknowledge that this attraction is common. Don't feel like you're ""weird"" or ""wrong"" for it.
* **Self-Reflection:** Spend some time honestly reflecting on *why* you're attracted to older men. What qualities do you find appealing? What needs are you fulfilling with this attraction?
* **Consider the Practicalities:** While attraction is important, it’s crucial to consider the potential challenges and differences in life stages, goals, and expectations that can arise in an age-gap relationship.
* **Don't Confuse Attraction with Need:** Make sure your attraction is based on genuine connection and compatibility, not just a need for something you perceive an older man to provide.

51,"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",You can be helped. Many of the people I see have multiple issues. These issues are often linked so that helping one issue will positively help the other issues.,"Okay, let's tackle this. It absolutely sounds like you're carrying a heavy load, and it's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge that and to reach out for support. The fact that you're asking if you have ""too many issues"" is a really important first step – it shows you're recognizing the complexity of what you're going through.

**The short answer is: No, you don’t have too many issues to address in counseling.** In fact, the combination of experiences you've had – sexual abuse, cancer, chronic insomnia, depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem – is *precisely* why counseling would be incredibly beneficial. These issues are deeply intertwined and often feed into each other.

Here’s a more detailed breakdown of why and how counseling can help:

**1. The Interconnectedness of Your Issues:**

* **Sexual Abuse & Trauma:** The impact of sexual abuse can be profound and long-lasting, often manifesting as anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, difficulty with intimacy, and chronic pain. It can fundamentally alter how you see yourself and the world.
* **Cancer & Survivorship:** Cancer is a traumatic experience, even if it's been successfully treated. It can trigger anxiety, depression, body image issues, and a sense of loss. The long-term effects of treatment can also contribute to insomnia.
* **Insomnia:** Chronic insomnia can be both a symptom and a contributor to depression and anxiety. It disrupts sleep patterns, which can exacerbate mood issues.
* **Depression & Anxiety:** These conditions often co-occur and can be triggered or worsened by the other experiences you’ve had.
* **Low Self-Esteem:** This is often a consequence of trauma and negative experiences, and it can impact your relationships and overall well-being.

**2. Counseling Can Help You:**

* **Process Trauma:**  A therapist specializing in trauma (like EMDR, CBT-Trauma Focused, or Sensorimotor Psychotherapy) can help you safely process the experiences of sexual abuse and understand their impact.
* **Develop Coping Mechanisms:** You'll learn strategies to manage anxiety, depression, and insomnia.
* **Build Self-Esteem:**  Counseling can help you challenge negative self-talk, develop a more positive self-image, and recognize your strengths.
* **Improve Sleep Hygiene:** While a therapist can't *cure* your insomnia, they can help you develop strategies to improve your sleep habits and address any underlying anxiety contributing to it.
* **Strengthen Relationships:**  Addressing your low self-esteem and processing your past can improve your ability to connect with your husband and others.
* **Gain Insight & Control:** Counseling provides a safe space to explore your feelings, understand your patterns, and take control of your mental and emotional health.


**3. Finding the Right Approach:**

* **Start with a General Therapist:** You don't need to know everything upfront. A good starting point would be a licensed therapist (psychologist, licensed clinical social worker, or licensed professional counselor) who specializes in trauma, anxiety, or depression.
* **Tell them about *everything*:**  Be honest with your therapist about your history. This is crucial for them to understand the depth of your challenges and tailor treatment accordingly.
* **Focus on One Thing at a Time:**  It’s okay to start with the most pressing issue – perhaps the anxiety or the insomnia – and gradually work through the others.

**4.  It’s Okay to Feel Overwhelmed:**

It’s completely understandable that you feel overwhelmed.  What you’re describing is a significant amount to work through.  Recognize that progress will likely be gradual.  Celebrate small victories, and be patient with yourself.

794,"I'm scared that I am with this man so I won't be alone. He should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case, and I don’t want to hurt him.","While not wanting to be alone may not be the best reason to be in a relationship, it is probably more common and normal a reason than you think.  Since you seem to care about your friend (""don't want to hurt him""), I imagine there are many other reasons that you are together.  I suggest that you talk about this open-heartedly with each other.  The idea of being afraid of being alone sounds like an honest starting place.  Don't try to ""figure out"" whether you should be with him.  Just talk.  The communication is likely to shine light on deepening connection for BOTH OF YOU.In the meantime, your idea that you don't deserve him is rooted in a ""core lie"" that you are telling yourself.  You can read about ""core lies"" and much more in my book, Living Yes, a Handbook for Being Human.  Check out www.LivingYes.org.Be easy on yourself.  You are deserving!~Mark","Okay, it sounds like you're carrying a really heavy and painful feeling right now. It’s incredibly brave of you to acknowledge these feelings and to reach out for support. Let’s break this down and explore what you're experiencing. It’s clear you’re grappling with a complex mix of fear, jealousy, and a desire to protect someone you care about.

Here's a breakdown of what you've said and some thoughts to consider:

**1. The Core Fear: Not Being Alone**

* **Loneliness is a powerful motivator:** The fear of being alone is a deeply rooted human instinct. It taps into our need for connection and belonging. It’s understandable that you’re feeling this way, especially if you've experienced loneliness in the past.
* **This fear is driving your actions:** You’re trying to hold onto him to avoid that feeling of isolation. This is a natural response, but it's important to recognize that it's rooted in a fear, not necessarily a healthy foundation for the relationship.

**2. The Jealousy and Belief He Deserves Someone Better**

* **This is a painful feeling:**  It's incredibly painful to feel like someone you care about is being treated well by someone else. It’s natural to want what you believe is best for them.
* **It’s important to examine the *source* of this belief:** Where is this belief coming from? Is it based on observation, or is it a projection of your own desires and insecurities?  It’s easy to idealize someone when we’re feeling vulnerable.
* **Recognize that you can't control someone else's happiness:**  No matter how much you care about him, you cannot dictate who he chooses to be with or how he feels.  Trying to control this is likely to cause you more pain.

**3. The Desire Not to Hurt Him**

* **This is a compassionate response:** You genuinely seem to care about his well-being, and wanting to avoid causing him pain is a beautiful quality.
* **However, holding on out of fear can *actually* hurt him:** You're potentially keeping him in a situation that isn’t right for him, and that's ultimately more harmful than letting him pursue a relationship that truly fulfills him.

**What Can You Do?**

Here's a roadmap for navigating this:

* **Acknowledge and Validate Your Feelings:** Don’t try to suppress or dismiss your emotions. It’s okay to feel jealous, scared, and uncertain. Saying to yourself, ""It's okay that I feel this way,"" can be a powerful first step.
* **Focus on Yourself:** This is *crucial*.  Instead of trying to control his relationship, invest in your own happiness and well-being. What brings you joy? What are your passions?  When you’re thriving, you’re less likely to be driven by fear.
* **Build a Strong Support System:** Lean on friends and family. Talking about your feelings with trusted people can provide perspective and support.
* **Consider Therapy:** A therapist can provide a safe space to explore these feelings in depth, understand their roots, and develop coping strategies. They can help you build self-esteem and learn to let go of unhealthy attachments.
* **Acceptance (This is the Hard Part):**  Ultimately, you need to accept that you can’t control this situation.  Acceptance doesn’t mean you’re happy about it, but it means you're releasing the energy you’re spending trying to change something you can't.

**Important Note:**  If you're experiencing intense feelings of jealousy or insecurity that are significantly impacting your life, it’s important to seek professional help.

450,"I've known him for about six years. We've dated off and on. I hadn't seen him in close to three years but recently started seeing him again. I really want this to last this time. I stayed the night. Do I text, call, or make contact first, the same day of the morning I left his house?","It is possible your question reflects some insecurity about whether or not either or you would like this relationship to continue.Otherwise, the answer to your question would appear naturally.  If you genuinely feel close enough to this person to sleep with him, then who texts whom first, wouldn't really matter too much.Try to understand within yourself whether you feel truly interested in this person as much as you would like to feel toward someone.","Okay, this is a really common and understandably nerve-wracking situation! It's great that you're thinking carefully about how to approach this. Given the history, the recent reconnection, and the fact you stayed the night, here's a breakdown of what to do, prioritizing a gentle and thoughtful approach:

**My Recommendation: A Text First - But Keep it Light & Curious**

A text is the best initial move. It's low pressure, allows him to respond on his own terms, and shows you're thinking of him. Here's a sample text, aiming for warmth and a gentle invitation:

* **Option 1 (More Casual):** ""Hey [His Name], it was really lovely seeing you last night. It feels like it's been a while. Hope you're having a good day!""
* **Option 2 (Slightly More Intent):** “Hey [His Name], just wanted to say I really enjoyed spending time with you last night. It was so good to reconnect. Hope you're doing well!”

**Why this approach is good:**

* **Low Pressure:**  A text doesn't demand an immediate response.
* **Opens the Door:** It lets him know you were thinking of him and that you enjoyed the time you spent together.
* **Gauge His Response:** His response will tell you *a lot*.  Is he enthusiastic?  Does he respond quickly and warmly? Or is his response brief and casual?

**What *Not* to Do Right Now:**

* **Don't Over-Text:** Resist the urge to send multiple texts in quick succession. Give him time to respond.
* **Don't Launch Into Deep Feelings:** This isn’t the time to pour your heart out. Keep it light and friendly.
* **Don't Initiate a Long Phone Call:** A call after a night together can feel a little intense right now.

**What to Do *After* His Response:**

* **If he responds warmly and enthusiastically:**  You can then suggest a casual activity – ""Would you be up for grabbing coffee/a drink sometime this week?""
* **If his response is brief or casual:**  Don’t push it.  A simple ""No worries! Hope you have a good one"" is a perfectly acceptable response.  Let him take the lead.
* **If he doesn’t respond within 24 hours:**  It’s okay to wait a little longer.  Don't bombard him.

**Important Considerations Given the History:**

* **Acknowledge the Gap:** The three years apart is significant. Be prepared for him to need a little time to readjust to being in contact.
* **Be Patient:**  Rebuilding a connection takes time. Don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen immediately.
* **Focus on Shared Interests:**  When you do talk, steer the conversation towards things you both enjoy.

**To help me give you even more tailored advice, could you tell me:**

*   What was the nature of your previous dating relationship? (Was it serious? Casual? Did it end amicably?)
*   What kind of communication style do you normally have with him? (Do you usually text a lot, or do you prefer phone calls?)",0.5180466771125793
1877,"I keep having these random thoughts that I don't want. Things like ""you aren't worth anything."" I know they're my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it.
   What is wrong with me, and how can I stop having these thoughts?","Many people have thoughts like those you describe, and often it feels like someone else is saying it because they are things that may have been said to you when you were very young.  When young children hear negative things about themselves they tend to internalize these negative ideas and to form negative core beliefs.  The good news is we can learn to stop these thoughts and to replace them with healthier thoughts.  The first step is to catch yourself when you are thinking these thoughts, and to stay ""stop!""; then replace it with another thought.  So for instance, maybe you fail a test or get rejected by a romantic interest.  You catch yourself saying ""you aren't worth anything"". Stop this thought, and replace it with ""You didn't do as well on that test as you would have liked.  Let's figure out how you can do better next time.""  Or ""she may not want to go out with you, but someone else will"". So the idea is to develop a voice of a ""friend"", who can tell you the kind of things you would say to your own best friend.  You might also pick up the book, Feeling Good, by David Burns. He gives many tips for how to change Negative Self Talk.","Okay, let's address this. What you're describing – having intrusive, unwanted thoughts like ""you aren't worth anything"" – is a really common experience, and it's incredibly distressing to deal with. It sounds like you’re already recognizing that these thoughts aren’t truly *you*, which is a huge first step. Let's break down what might be happening and what you can do.

**What's Likely Going On:**

* **Intrusive Thoughts:** These are unwanted thoughts, images, or urges that pop into your mind. They can be disturbing, upsetting, or even frightening. The key thing to understand is that having them doesn’t mean you *want* them, or that you are a bad person. It simply means your brain is struggling with something.
* **Negative Self-Talk:** The specific thought you mentioned, ""you aren’t worth anything,"" is a classic example of negative self-talk. This can be fueled by underlying feelings of insecurity, shame, anxiety, or depression.
* **Anxiety and/or Depression:** These conditions are frequently associated with intrusive thoughts. Anxiety can manifest as a constant stream of worries, while depression can contribute to feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness.
* **Underlying Trauma:** Sometimes, intrusive thoughts can be linked to past trauma, even if you don’t consciously remember the event. The brain can hold onto these thoughts as a way of processing the experience.
* **Brain Chemistry:** There can be imbalances in neurotransmitters (chemicals in the brain) that contribute to intrusive thoughts.
* **Perfectionism/High Standards:**  Often, people who hold themselves to very high standards are prone to negative self-talk, as they are constantly criticizing themselves.


**What You Can Do – Strategies to Manage These Thoughts:**

1. **Recognize and Accept:** The first step is to simply acknowledge that these thoughts are happening. Don’t fight them or try to suppress them completely – this often makes them worse.  Tell yourself, ""Okay, I'm having this thought. It doesn't mean it's true.""

2. **The ""Thought Defusion"" Technique:** This is a key technique for dealing with intrusive thoughts. It involves creating distance between yourself and the thought. Here are a few ways to do it:
   * **Labeling:** When you have a thought, say to yourself, “I’m having the thought that…”  Then, just observe the thought without judgment.
   * **Singing the Thought:** Seriously!  Sing the thought to a silly tune. This can make it seem less powerful.
   * **Writing the Thought Down:** Write the thought down on a piece of paper and then rip it up.
   * **Imagine the Thought on a Cloud:** Visualize the thought as a cloud floating by.

3. **Grounding Techniques:** When you're struggling with intrusive thoughts, grounding techniques can help you feel more present and in control. Try:
   * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
   * **Deep Breathing:** Focus on slow, deep breaths.

4. **Challenge the Thought:** Once you've acknowledged the thought, gently challenge it. Ask yourself:
   * “Is this thought actually true?”
   * “What evidence do I have to support this thought?”
   * “What’s a more balanced or realistic way of looking at this situation?”
   * “Would I say this to a friend?”

5. **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself.  Treat yourself with the same understanding and compassion you would offer a friend who was struggling. Recognize that you're doing the best you can.

6. **Focus on Positive Activities:** Engage in activities you enjoy, spend time with loved ones, and focus on your strengths. This can help shift your attention away from negative thoughts.

7. **Limit Triggers:** If you can identify things that seem to trigger these thoughts (e.g., certain situations, people, or times of day), try to minimize your exposure to them, at least temporarily.

**Important: Seeking Professional Help**

* **Talk to a Therapist:**  A therapist (especially one specializing in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - CBT or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy - ACT) can help you understand the root causes of your intrusive thoughts and develop coping strategies. CBT and ACT are particularly effective for managing intrusive thoughts.
* **Talk to Your Doctor:**  Discussing your symptoms with your doctor can help rule out any underlying medical conditions and explore potential medication options if appropriate.  Sometimes, medication (like SSRIs) can be helpful in managing anxiety and depression, which can, in turn, reduce the frequency and intensity of intrusive thoughts.

2746,"I'm a guy. If I don't like girls, nor do I like guys, does that mean I'm gay?","Hi, and thanks for your question. I agree with my colleagues about researching asexuality, but I want too add a couple of things about that:Here is a website that you can start with to get some information about asexuality - http://www.asexuality.org/home/There are a whole lot of myths surrounding asexuality. One is that people who are asexual have absolutely no interest in sex, and that is not always the case. There are variations of asexuality. Some people who are asexual have an interest in sex and others don't. Also, once you read more on this topic, you may find that you don't connect with asexuality either, and that is okay. Our society usually thinks of sexual orientations as only being straight, gay, lesbian, or bisexual, but the truth is there are many variations of sexual orientations. Keep exploring. There is a good chance that there is a community of people who feel like you do. Finally, labels are important for a lot of things, but labeling ourselves can sometimes lead to some painful feelings. Try not to feel pressured to label yourself too quickly. This is your journey. Your experience. Take all the time you need. You may never feel the need to label how you feel, and that is okay, too. Hope this helps. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC  ","That's a really thoughtful and important question, and it's great that you're taking the time to really understand yourself. The short answer is: **not necessarily.**

Here's a breakdown of why it's complex and how to think about it:

**1. Sexuality is a Spectrum:**

* **Sexuality isn't just ""gay"" or ""straight.""** It's a complex and personal experience. It's about who you're attracted to, and attraction can be influenced by many things – emotional connection, personality, physical appearance, etc.
* **There's a huge range of human sexuality.** People experience attraction differently, and there's no single ""right"" way to feel.

**2. Asexuality is a Valid Orientation:**

* **Asexuality means a lack of sexual attraction.** It’s a valid orientation.  It doesn't mean you can't have romantic feelings or deep connections with others. Some asexual people experience romantic attraction, while others don't.
* **Asexual people can still desire intimacy and connection.** They might enjoy cuddling, spending time together, and forming close relationships, but not necessarily with sexual activity.

**3. You Can Be Attracted to *No One*:**

* **You're allowed to simply not be attracted to anyone.** It’s perfectly okay to not feel attraction to men or women.  This doesn’t automatically label you as gay.
* **It’s okay to not have a label.** You don’t *need* to fit into a specific category.

**4. What About ""Questioning"":**

* **You're ""questioning.""** This is a perfectly normal and common phase. It means you’re exploring your feelings and trying to understand yourself better. It’s okay to not have all the answers right now.

**Here’s what you can do to understand yourself better:**

* **Explore your feelings:**  Spend time honestly examining *why* you don't like girls or guys.  Are there specific reasons? Are there certain qualities you're looking for in a partner?
* **Research:** Learn more about different sexual orientations and identities.  Resources like:
    * **The Trevor Project:** [https://www.thetrevorproject.org/](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/)
    * **GLAAD:** [https://www.glaad.org/](https://www.glaad.org/)

    * **Wikipedia - Sexuality:** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexuality) (Use with caution – it’s a starting point for research)
* **Talk to someone you trust:**  A friend, family member, therapist, or counselor can provide support and guidance.

**Important Note:**  Don't feel pressured to label yourself.  Your feelings are valid, and it's okay to take your time figuring things out.  Focus on what *you* want and what makes *you* happy.

The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with  Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events. Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression.  The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment.

","Okay, it’s incredibly brave of you to acknowledge you’re struggling and to reach out and consider solutions. It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling this way, and it’s great that you’re exploring options like counseling. Let's talk about whether counseling could help you, especially given that your depression feels worse despite medication.

**Here's a breakdown of how counseling can potentially help, and what to consider:**

**1. How Counseling Can Help with Depression and Anxiety:**

* **Understanding Your Depression:** Counseling, particularly with a therapist specializing in depression, can help you delve deeper into the *why* behind your feelings. It's not just about managing symptoms; it’s about understanding the root causes – past trauma, negative thought patterns, relationship issues, life stressors, etc.
* **Developing Coping Strategies:** You’ve been on medication, which is fantastic. Counseling can complement that by teaching you *additional* coping mechanisms – things like mindfulness techniques, relaxation exercises, cognitive restructuring (challenging negative thoughts), behavioral activation (scheduling enjoyable activities), and problem-solving skills.
* **Processing Emotions:** Depression often involves difficulty processing and expressing emotions. A therapist provides a safe, non-judgmental space to explore and work through these feelings.
* **Improving Communication:**  Depression can impact your relationships. Counseling can help you improve communication skills and address any relationship difficulties contributing to your distress.
* **Boosting Self-Esteem and Self-Compassion:**  Depression often erodes self-worth. Counseling can help you rebuild self-esteem and cultivate self-compassion.
* **Addressing Medication Side Effects/Effectiveness:**  A therapist can help you communicate openly with your psychiatrist about how you’re feeling, whether the medication is working as expected, and any potential side effects you're experiencing.  They can work *collaboratively* with your doctor.

**2. Why Counseling Might Be Particularly Helpful Now:**

You mentioned your depression feels worse lately, despite being on medication. This is a really important signal. Here's why counseling could be especially beneficial in this situation:

* **Medication Isn’t Enough:** Sometimes, medication alone isn't enough to fully address the underlying issues contributing to depression.
* **Potential for Medication Adjustment:** A therapist can help you and your psychiatrist assess if your current medication dosage or type needs to be adjusted.
* **Exploring New Approaches:** It might be time to explore different therapeutic approaches.  There are many types of therapy that can be effective for depression, such as:
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Focuses on changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.
    * **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):**  Teaches skills for managing intense emotions and improving relationships.
    * **Psychodynamic Therapy:** Explores unconscious patterns and past experiences.
    * **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):**  Focuses on accepting difficult thoughts and feelings and committing to values-based actions.


**3. What to Do Next:**

* **Talk to Your Psychiatrist:**  The first step is to discuss how you're feeling with your psychiatrist. Be honest about the worsening symptoms. They can assess whether a medication adjustment is needed.
* **Find a Therapist:**  Here’s how to find a therapist:
    * **Your Insurance Company:**  Check your insurance provider’s website for a list of in-network therapists.
    * **Psychology Today:** [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) – This website allows you to search for therapists based on location, specialty, insurance, and other criteria.
    * **Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs):**  If your employer offers an EAP, they often provide free or low-cost counseling services.
    * **Local Mental Health Organizations:**  Search online for mental health organizations in your area.
* **Consider a Collaborative Approach:**  Ideally, you want a therapist who can work closely with your psychiatrist to create a comprehensive treatment plan.

The truth is, **you absolutely do not have too many issues.** What you're describing is a complex and understandably overwhelming experience. It’s fantastic that you're recognizing the need for support – that’s a huge first step.

Let's break down why you don't have too many issues and how to approach this with a therapist:

**1. The Interconnectedness of Your Issues:**

* **Sexual Abuse:** This is a foundational issue that profoundly impacts self-esteem, relationships, and often contributes to anxiety and depression. It’s almost certainly interwoven with your other challenges.
* **Breast Cancer Survivor:**  This experience is incredibly traumatic and can trigger anxiety, fear, body image issues, and grief. The physical and emotional toll can be significant.
* **Insomnia:** Chronic insomnia can exacerbate depression, anxiety, and impact overall well-being. It can create a vicious cycle.
* **Depression & Anxiety:** These are frequently linked, and your history of trauma and other stressors likely play a significant role.
* **Low Self-Esteem:** This is often a consequence of trauma, abuse, and negative self-perception.
* **Long-Term Marriage:**  While a wonderful thing, a long-term marriage can also bring its own set of complexities, potential communication challenges, and perhaps unspoken needs.

The fact that these issues are interconnected is *why* you need a skilled therapist, not why it's overwhelming.

**2. Why You Haven’t Sought Counseling Before Doesn’t Matter:**

It’s incredibly common to delay seeking help, especially when dealing with sensitive and difficult topics like sexual abuse. Shame, fear of judgment, and not knowing where to start are all barriers. The fact that you haven’t had counseling before is irrelevant. A good therapist will create a safe and supportive space for you to explore anything and everything you need to.

**3. Finding the Right Therapist is Key:**

* **Specialization:** Look for a therapist who specializes in trauma, chronic illness, and/or relationship issues.  Trauma-informed therapists are particularly important given your history.
* **Therapeutic Approach:** Different approaches can be helpful. Some common ones include:
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Helps identify and change negative thought patterns.
    * **Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR):**  Often used for trauma.
    * **Psychodynamic Therapy:**  Explores unconscious patterns and past experiences.
* **Relationship:** The therapeutic relationship itself is crucial. You need to feel comfortable, safe, and understood by your therapist.

**4. How to Approach Counseling with So Much to Work Through:**

* **Start with a Consultation:** Most therapists offer a brief initial consultation. Use this to discuss your concerns, ask about their experience, and get a sense of whether you feel comfortable with them.
* **Prioritize:** You don’t have to tackle everything at once.  Your therapist can help you identify the most pressing issues and create a phased approach.
* **Be Honest:**  Complete honesty is essential for therapy to be effective.

2412,"I broke up with him three weeks ago because I felt that he needed to be more respectful. He has since had a rebound relationship. He says he loves and misses me but refuses to see me. He says it's going to be too difficult to see me. Every time we talk, it feels like I'm being pushy to see him. He used to be so madly in love with me, but now, it seems like he couldn’t care less. I think I'm running him away.","Hi Kansas,I think your first instinct was good; you broke up with him. You deserve respect, but right now you're not acting as if you deserve it when you push to see him as he's moving on with a new relationship. It's appropriate now for you to respect that relationship and listen to what he says he wants, which is space. Do you think he's going to be any different with her? This a common, unfounded fear we have. I wonder if maybe you miss the feeling of being in love and having a partner more than you miss him. The bottom line is you can't make someone love you, and you can't make someone be loving towards you, because how someone treats you (and the choices they make) has everything to do with who they are, and nothing to do with who you are. I hope you gather support from others and move on in hope and strength for your own future.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it sounds incredibly painful. You’re picking up on a lot of key things here, and your instincts about running him away are likely correct. Let’s break down what’s happening and what you can do:

**1. Understanding His Behavior:**

* **The Rebound:** The fact that he’s quickly moved on to a new relationship is a huge red flag. It suggests he's using the situation to avoid dealing with his feelings for you and the reasons for the breakup. It's not about genuine love or missing you; it’s about a temporary distraction.
* **Avoiding Difficult Conversations:** His refusal to see you and his claim that it's ""too difficult"" is a classic tactic. He’s likely trying to maintain control of the situation and avoid confronting the issues that led to the breakup.
* **Shifting Feelings:** You're right to notice the change in his demeanor. When someone says ""I love and miss you"" while simultaneously pushing you away, it’s rarely genuine. It’s often a way to keep you invested and hoping you’ll change your mind.
* **You’re Running Him Away?** You're perceptive to realize you might be contributing to this.  The more you reach out, the more he can use it against you, saying you're being ""pushy.""

**2. Why You Might Feel This Way (and Why It's Not Your Fault):**

* **The Initial Connection:** It’s understandable that you still have feelings for someone who was once so deeply in love with you.  It's natural to hold onto hope, especially when there were strong feelings involved.
* **The Desire for Closure:** You likely crave closure and want to understand what went wrong. However, he’s actively preventing you from getting that.
* **Feeling Hurt and Rejected:** It's incredibly painful to be rejected and to see someone you cared about move on so quickly.

**3. What You *Should* Do (and What You Shouldn’t):**

* **Stop Initiating Contact:** This is the *most* important step. You’ve identified that your attempts to connect are fueling his behavior.  **Do not contact him.**  This includes texts, calls, social media messages, or asking mutual friends for information about him.
* **Accept His Boundaries:** He's setting a boundary – a very clear one. Respect it.  Trying to force a connection will only push him further away and make you feel worse.
* **Focus on Yourself:** This is crucial.  Channel your energy into healing, self-care, and reconnecting with your own life. Spend time with friends and family, pursue your hobbies, and do things that make you happy.
* **Allow Yourself to Grieve:** It’s okay to feel sad, angry, and disappointed.  Allow yourself to experience these emotions without trying to fix them.
* **Recognize His Choice:** He’s chosen to move on, and you can’t change that.  Accepting this doesn't mean you condone his behavior, but it frees you from the pain of wanting something you can’t have.

**4. Addressing the “Pushy” Feeling:**

You’re feeling like you’re being pushy, and that's a valid feeling. However, remember that his refusal to see you isn't about you; it's about *him* and his unwillingness to address the situation.  Don't internalize his rejection.

**5. Important Note:**

It's important to acknowledge that you deserve someone who respects your boundaries and wants to be in a healthy, open relationship.  This situation is a clear indication that he doesn’t meet those criteria.

2328,"My dad cheated on my mom for 13 years. I cannot stop obsessing over the fact that my boyfriend might be cheating on me even when I know he isn't. I have full access to his phone, social media, and e-mails. I never find anything, but I'm obsessed with constantly checking just in case. How do I stop this? It's driving a wedge between us.","Hi Greenville, I respect that you're owning your own overreactions, and that you want to give your boyfriend the respect he deserves. The truth is that some people cheat, and some don't, and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they can't be trusted.The answer here is in two different areas. Basically, if you want to feel differently (more trusting, in your case), you look at your thoughts, and your behaviours.Your thoughts are stuck... like tires in deep ruts in the road. These thoughts are only habits, they don't reflect the truth. Fear is probably whispering in your ear things like ""everyone cheats"", or "" you're not enough for him"". Once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you, picture those words in red next time they come up. Ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought (there won't be much...perhaps none), and what is the evidence that doesn't support it (I know lots of good men, I know I deserve love and loyalty, there is no sign of infidelity...). You're learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear. That's the first half. Practise these thoughts.The rest of the work is in your behaviours. Act as though you trust him. Force yourself to not check or interrogate, and the less you check, the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel. Acting ""as if"" something if true strangely helps us believe it.It's possible to change the way we think, and this is turn changes the way we feel. Try this to start, and see a therapist for support and cognitive behavioural therapy if you want to dive more deeply into why this is happening and how to stop it. Good luck!","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it’s incredibly brave of you to recognize it and reach out for help. What you're experiencing is a complex combination of factors, and it's completely understandable that it's causing you so much distress. Let's break this down and explore some ways to address it.

**1. Understanding the Root of Your Obsession:**

* **The Trauma of Your Family History:** The fact that your dad cheated on your mom for 13 years is a *huge* factor. It’s created a deep-seated insecurity and a possible expectation (even if unconscious) that trust is fragile and easily broken. Your brain might be wired to look for signs of betrayal, a pattern established by a significant trauma. This is a very common response to childhood trauma – a heightened sensitivity to potential threats to safety and security.
* **Anxiety and Control:** Your need to constantly check his phone, social media, and emails is likely driven by a desire for control. When you feel powerless in a relationship (even when there's no evidence of wrongdoing), seeking control through surveillance can be a way to regain a sense of security.
* **Low Self-Esteem:** Sometimes, obsessive checking is linked to feelings of self-doubt. You might be questioning your worthiness of love and trust, leading you to overcompensate by seeking reassurance.
* **Attachment Style:** Your attachment style (how you relate to others through your early experiences) can play a role. If you have an anxious attachment style, you may be more prone to worry about your relationships.

**2. Strategies to Stop the Obsessive Checking:**

* **Recognize the Pattern:** You've already taken a huge first step by recognizing that this behavior is happening and that it's causing harm.  Continue to acknowledge this pattern to yourself.
* **Challenge Your Thoughts:** When you feel the urge to check, actively challenge the thoughts fueling it. Ask yourself: ""What evidence do I *actually* have that he's cheating? Is this a rational fear, or is it based on anxiety and past trauma?""  Write down your thoughts and then write down counterarguments.
* **The “If-Then” Plan:**  Create a specific plan for when you feel the urge to check. For example: ""If I feel the urge to check his phone, I will take three deep breaths, do a quick physical activity (like a short walk), or call a friend to talk.""
* **Gradual Reduction:**  This won't happen overnight. Start with small steps. Maybe you commit to checking his phone only once a day, then twice a day, and so on. Focus on extending the time between checks.
* **Distraction Techniques:** When the urge hits, engage in activities that pull your focus away: exercise, hobbies, spending time with friends, reading, anything that requires your full attention.
* **Limit Access (Temporarily):** This is a difficult one, but consider temporarily limiting your access to his accounts. This isn’t about denying yourself information, but about creating a space to work on your anxiety.  Tell him you're working on managing your anxiety and need to take a step back from constant checking.

**3. Addressing the Relationship Dynamic:**

* **Communicate with Your Boyfriend:** This is crucial, but needs to be approached carefully.  Don't accuse him of anything. Instead, explain that you're struggling with anxiety and a tendency to overthink, stemming from past trauma.  Let him know you trust him, but you need his support in helping you manage your feelings.  “I’m working on managing my anxiety, and I appreciate you being patient with me as I navigate this.”
* **Set Boundaries:**  You have the right to establish boundaries in your relationship.  It's okay to say, “I need a little more space to process my feelings.”

**4. Seeking Professional Support – *Highly Recommended***

* **Therapy:** This is the *most* important step. A therapist can help you:
    * **Process the Trauma:**  Working through the impact of your dad's infidelity.
    * **Address Anxiety:**  Learn coping mechanisms for anxiety and obsessive thoughts.
    * **Develop Trust:**  Explore the roots of your difficulty trusting and develop healthier patterns.
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** CBT is particularly effective for addressing obsessive thoughts.
    * **Attachment Therapy:** Can help you understand and change your attachment style.

605,"I'm being verbally abused on a daily basis by my parents in front of my child. I feel like I’m trapped and I have no escape. I feel like I have to listen to the horrible things they say and just take all of it.
   I need some way of learning how to cope with listening to it especially since I have nowhere else to go. I feel very emotionally drained How can I deal with this?","Hello, I am sorry to hear about you feeling verbally abused, trapped without an escape, and emotionally drained. Sounds to me like you are being treated more like a child than an adult.  It's time to learn about healthy boundaries and being treated like an adult. This process will take time, but beyond elevating your self-esteem and worth, you will be modeling to your children a healthy adult. Model to them an empowered, confident, and person that is worthy of respect. Please invest in yourself. Find yourself a therapist that encourages and empowers you to have a voice and not feel invisible. You'll be so glad you did!","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult, and it’s completely understandable that you're feeling trapped, emotionally drained, and overwhelmed. What you're experiencing – being verbally abused in front of your child – is profoundly damaging, and the fact that you feel you have nowhere to go only amplifies the pressure. Let’s break this down and explore some ways you can cope, focusing on strategies you can use *right now*, even when you feel trapped.

**1. Recognizing and Validating Your Feelings:**

* **You are not wrong:** The first and most important thing to understand is that you don’t deserve to be treated this way. Their behavior is abusive, and you are not responsible for it.
* **Validate your pain:** Allow yourself to feel the emotions – the anger, sadness, fear, shame. Don’t try to suppress them. Saying to yourself, ""It's okay that I'm feeling this way. This is a horrible situation, and I'm allowed to be hurt,"" can be a starting point.
* **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings, even just for a few minutes each day, can be a powerful release. It doesn't have to be perfect prose – just getting it out can help.

**2. Immediate Coping Strategies During the Abuse:**

These are things you can do *in the moment* when you're hearing the hurtful things:

* **Grey Rocking:** This technique involves becoming as uninteresting as possible to the abuser.  It’s about minimizing your emotional reaction. Respond with brief, neutral statements like “Okay,” “I see,” or “That’s interesting.” Don’t argue, defend yourself, or try to explain. The goal is to deprive them of the reaction they’re seeking.
* **Mental Distance:**  Try to create a mental space between yourself and what they're saying. Imagine yourself as an observer, like watching a play.  This can help you detach emotionally.
* **Focus on Your Child:**  If possible, subtly redirect your attention to your child.  This isn’t about ignoring the abuse, but about grounding yourself in the love and responsibility you feel for them.  A gentle touch, a reassuring word to your child, can be a small act of defiance and self-preservation.
* **Breathing Exercises:**  Practice deep, slow breathing to calm your nervous system. Box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4) can be particularly effective.
* **Internal Mantra:** Have a quiet phrase you repeat to yourself – something like “I am strong,” “I am safe,” “I can get through this.”

**3. Protecting Your Child:**

* **Shielding:** This is paramount.  If possible, try to create moments where your child isn't present. This might be as simple as stepping outside for a few minutes.
* **Reassure Your Child (When Possible):**  Depending on your child’s age, you can offer simple reassurance: “Mommy/Daddy loves you very much,” or “It’s not your fault.”  Don’t elaborate on the abuse.
* **Don’t Model the Behavior:**  Resist the urge to respond in kind.  It’s incredibly difficult, but reacting with anger will only escalate the situation.

**4. Long-Term Strategies & Seeking Support:**

* **Therapy is Crucial:**  Finding a therapist who specializes in domestic violence or family dynamics is absolutely essential. They can provide you with tools to cope, help you process the trauma, and develop a safety plan.  Look for therapists who offer telehealth options if in-person access is limited.
* **Support Groups:** Connecting with others who have experienced similar situations can be incredibly validating and empowering.
* **Safety Planning:**  Develop a plan for when you need to leave the situation. This includes having a safe place to go, essential documents, and a way to contact help.
* **Document the Abuse:**  Keep a record of the abusive incidents – dates, times, what was said, and any witnesses. This can be helpful if you decide to pursue legal action.

1459,What makes a healthy marriage last?,"In my mind, a healthy marriage has two participants, meaning both people participate equally in the intimate connection of marriage. An unequal participation comes in many forms, such as one person checking out of conversations when it becomes emotional, or speaking over and for each other in these conversations. Couple’s should strive for engagement and support, but doing it in a way that works for each person individually. I hope this helps.","Okay, let's tackle this big question! There's no magic formula, but research and countless couples who've made it through decades point to a combination of factors that really contribute to a healthy, lasting marriage. Here's a breakdown, broken down into key categories:

**1. Communication - The Foundation:**

* **Open and Honest Communication:** This is *the* most cited factor. It’s not just about talking, but about truly *hearing* and understanding your partner's thoughts, feelings, and needs. This includes being willing to share your own vulnerabilities.
* **Active Listening:**  Really paying attention when your partner is speaking, without interrupting, judging, or planning your response.  Reflecting back what you've heard to ensure understanding (""So, what I'm hearing you say is..."").
* **""I"" Statements:** Expressing your feelings and needs without blaming or criticizing.  Instead of ""You always leave your socks on the floor!"" try ""I feel frustrated when I see clothes on the floor because it makes the house feel cluttered.""
* **Regular Check-Ins:**  Making time for conversations about the relationship itself – what's working, what's not, and what you both need.
* **Conflict Resolution Skills:** Learning *how* to argue constructively. This means staying calm, focusing on the issue, taking breaks when needed, and finding compromises.


**2. Connection & Intimacy:**

* **Emotional Intimacy:**  Feeling safe and comfortable sharing your deepest thoughts, fears, and dreams with your partner.  This builds trust and a sense of closeness.
* **Physical Intimacy:**  This goes beyond just sex. It includes touch, affection, cuddling, and other forms of physical connection that demonstrate love and desire.  (The *type* of intimacy that’s important varies greatly from couple to couple).
* **Quality Time:**  Spending dedicated time together, doing things you both enjoy, and disconnecting from distractions (phones, work, etc.).
* **Shared Activities & Interests:** Having common hobbies or activities you can enjoy together strengthens your bond.
* **Rituals & Traditions:** Creating your own routines and traditions (e.g., weekly date nights, Sunday morning pancakes) can add meaning and connection.

**3. Respect & Appreciation:**

* **Mutual Respect:** Valuing your partner's opinions, beliefs, and feelings, even when you disagree.
* **Appreciation:** Regularly expressing gratitude for your partner – both for big things and small things.  Small gestures of kindness and affection go a long way.
* **Support:** Being each other’s biggest cheerleader, supporting your partner's goals and dreams.
* **Acceptance:** Accepting your partner for who they are, flaws and all. (Trying to change them fundamentally is usually a recipe for conflict).

**4. Commitment & Work:**

* **Shared Values & Goals:** Having a common vision for the future – this doesn't mean you have to agree on everything, but having core values aligned makes navigating life's challenges easier.
* **Willingness to Work on the Relationship:**  Recognizing that marriage requires ongoing effort and a commitment to continually improve.
* **Forgiveness:**  Being able to forgive each other’s mistakes and move forward. Holding onto resentment is incredibly damaging.
* **Adaptability:** Life throws curveballs. Being able to adapt to changes – in careers, family, health, etc. – together is crucial.

**5. Individual Well-being:**

* **Self-Care:**  Taking care of your own physical and mental health.  A happy, healthy individual makes for a better partner.
* **Maintaining Your Own Identity:** It's important to maintain your own interests, friendships, and sense of self outside of the marriage.
* **Personal Growth:** Supporting each other's personal growth and development.



**Important Notes:**

* **Every Couple is Different:** What works for one couple may not work for another. It’s about finding what *you* both need to thrive.
* **Seek Help When Needed:** Don’t wait until things are in crisis.  Couples counseling can provide valuable tools and support.
* **It’s a Journey, Not a Destination:** There will be ups and downs. The key is to navigate them together with love, respect, and a commitment to your relationship.

3235,"I know that I need to get past my feelings for this person I fell in love with, but t's so difficult to move on because he showed me feelings I've never felt before. 

I feel like I don't  want to be without my genuine love for him, but logically, I know I need to be without him. I can't discuss this with anybody in my life because the conditions surrounding our love are considered  ""wrong"" by a lot of people.

How can I get myself to just move on?","It's difficult to move on and let go, especially when you've experienced things for the first time with someone, or feelings you've never felt before, as you said.I like the fact that you are looking at your situation ""logically"".  Feelings can take time to fade, but you seem to understand, even if it is subconsciously, that it's the feelings he stirred up in you that are keeping you tied to him, not necessarily the person himself. Realize that you can and will experience those feelings again with another person - the RIGHT person. Don't hold onto someone who is wrong for you just because of something like this. You're wanting those feelings and wanting a relationship - but with him necessarily? Or with anybody? You said you don't want to be without your love for him - not you don't want to be without him. In fact, you said you know you need to be without him. It seems like it's the LOVE that you can't let go of, and the feelings. Not the person. Trust me, you will find that again. Take some time to let this fade. Don't try to force him or anyone else into a role that is meant for someone else. Cherish the memories and the experiences you had. Sounds like it's been a valuable learning and growth experience for you, but you have your own reasons, and I don't know what they are, for thinking this person isn't good for you. Trust your gut instinct and be glad you've had this relationship. Not all are meant to last. But all shape you into the person you are and will become, and all teach us important lessons.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it’s incredibly brave of you to acknowledge how deeply you're feeling this. It's completely understandable that you're struggling – experiencing a profound connection, especially one that felt so new and special, is incredibly painful. And the added layer of secrecy and feeling like you’re going against what others believe makes it exponentially harder. Let's break down how you can approach this, focusing on both the emotional and practical steps.

**1. Acknowledge and Validate Your Feelings:**

* **Don’t Shame Yourself:** The first and most important thing is to stop beating yourself up for feeling so strongly. You experienced something beautiful and real, and it’s okay to grieve the loss of that experience, even if it's not ""right"" in the eyes of others.
* **Name the Feelings:** You've already identified some key feelings – longing, grief, confusion, perhaps even a sense of betrayal (even if it's not intentional).  Specifically naming these feelings can help you process them. Write them down.
* **It’s Okay to Miss Him:**  It’s perfectly okay to still miss him, to think about him, to remember the good times. Trying to completely suppress those feelings will only make them stronger in the long run.


**2. Create Distance – Strategically:**

Since you can't easily cut off contact, you need to create a buffer. This is crucial for your healing.

* **No Contact (or Minimal Contact):** This is often the hardest, but the most effective. It means no texting, calling, social media stalking, or “accidental” run-ins. This is about giving yourself the space to detach.
* **Unfollow/Mute on Social Media:** Seriously, this is vital. Seeing his posts or updates will only keep the wound open.
* **Limit Reminders:** If there are places you frequented together, try to avoid them, at least initially.

**3. Shift Your Focus – Redirect Your Energy:**

Because you're feeling so intensely, you need to actively steer your thoughts and energy elsewhere.

* **Reconnect with Yourself:** This is a great time to rediscover your own passions, interests, and values. What makes *you* happy? What have you been neglecting?
* **Invest in Existing Relationships:** Spend time with supportive friends and family.  A strong support system is invaluable during this time.
* **New Activities:**  Join a class, volunteer, take up a hobby – anything that engages you and provides a sense of accomplishment.
* **Self-Care:** Prioritize your physical and mental health.  Eat well, exercise, get enough sleep, and practice relaxation techniques (meditation, deep breathing, yoga).

**4. Cognitive Techniques – Changing Your Thought Patterns:**

* **Challenge Idealization:** It’s easy to fall into the trap of remembering only the good things and forgetting the less-than-perfect aspects of the relationship. Actively remind yourself of any challenges, disagreements, or things that didn’t work. This isn't about blaming him, but about getting a more balanced perspective.
* **Focus on Your Future:** Visualize your life moving forward – your goals, your dreams, your happiness.  Remind yourself that you deserve to be happy, and that this relationship isn't part of that picture.
* **Reframe the Experience:**  Instead of viewing this as a ""failed love,"" try to see it as a valuable learning experience. You’ve learned about yourself, your needs, and what you’re looking for in a partner.

**5. Addressing the Secrecy - Finding a Safe Space (Even if it's Internal):**

You mentioned the ""wrongness"" of the situation. This is adding another layer of complexity.

* **Journaling:**  This can be a safe space to explore your feelings without judgment.
* **Focus on Your Agency:** Remind yourself that you are in control of your own healing process. You don’t need anyone else's approval.
* **Small, Trusted Allies (If Possible):** While you can’t discuss it openly, is there *one* person you deeply trust who might offer a listening ear without judgment? (This is a huge ask, and only do it if you feel absolutely safe).

**Important Note:** Because you’re dealing with a situation that feels “wrong” according to others, it’s possible you’re experiencing shame or guilt. This can significantly hinder your healing. Be kind to yourself and recognize that you're doing the best you can in a difficult circumstance.

2406,"I have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and I just had my first kiss five months ago. I’m worried that, at this rate, I won’t have a boyfriend for a very long time. The problem is that I want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, I don't want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex. I have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. Luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. I feel dirty by doing this, but I feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal.

Most people are surprised when they find out that I am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think I am really good looking. I am tall, I play lots of sports, and I get excellent grades in school. I am in my first year of university right now, and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest. It bothers me. Most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already. I feel like I will be single forever sometimes.","I think that every person who has been single for any extended period of time has felt the same worries - myself included. Since relationships are so important to us we fear not having them and being single. It is similar to fearing that we won't ever get a good job when we have been out of work for awhile or fearing that we won't be healthy when we have been sick. We fear these things because they are so important - not because these fears are realistic or true! There is immense pressure put on young single people from peers and media to conform to ideas of what is normal and to meet expectations in terms of sexual experience, dating, etc. While some people may judge an adult who is a virgin - others will respect your choices and feel even more attracted to you because of your choices. Experimenting with sex, so long as you are being safe and respectful is also completely okay and normal. Since expectations vary and we can't be happy if we are always comparing ourselves to other people, we need to ultimately trust that being who we are and building a loving relationship with ourselves is the key to meeting someone who will cherish us for all the ways that we are special and unique, virgin or not. When we are able to really accept ourselves and trust in our loveableness (not a real word but you get what I mean!) then meeting someone special is simply a matter of time and effort - putting ourselves out in the world in situations where we are likely to meet other single people looking for relationships. When you are most afraid of being alone - remember that this fear is simply a reminder of how much you value relationships. Use that passion about wanting relationships to build the best relationship you can with yourself and then one day soon some lucky person will stumble into your life and benefit immensely from your passion and your ability to be authentically who you are rather than pretending to be ""normal"" or whatever that is anyway. Hope this helps! ","Okay, let's unpack this. What you're feeling is incredibly common, and it’s brave of you to talk about it. It sounds like you’re dealing with a really intense mix of anxiety, shame, and the pressure of societal expectations, all layered on top of genuine desires for connection and intimacy. Let's break down your feelings and explore some ways to approach this.

**1. Validating Your Feelings:**

* **It's Okay to Feel This Way:** Seriously. The feeling of being ""behind"" is a very real and painful one, especially when you're comparing yourself to others. It’s completely valid to feel anxious about your relationship status, especially when you crave connection and intimacy. Don't beat yourself up for feeling this way.
* **Everyone's Timeline is Different:** There is *no* right or wrong timeline for relationships or sexual experiences. What feels ""normal"" is entirely constructed by society, not by any inherent rule. Your journey is yours, and it’s okay if it looks different from others'.
* **The Shame is a Signal:** The feeling of being ""dirty"" after those encounters is a sign that you recognize this behavior isn’t aligned with your values. It’s good that you’re acknowledging this and recognizing the discomfort.

**2. Understanding the Root of the Pressure:**

* **Social Comparison:** You’re being heavily influenced by seeing what others are doing. Social media amplifies this, creating a distorted view of reality. Remember that people only present the highlight reel of their lives.
* **The ""Normal"" Myth:** The idea that everyone your age *should* be in a relationship is a dangerous myth. It creates unrealistic expectations and can lead to feeling like you're failing.
* **Feeling Like You Need to ""Prove"" Yourself:** The pressure to seem ""normal"" – particularly because of your looks – is adding another layer of stress. You're trying to fit a mold that doesn't suit you.

**3. Addressing the Behavior and the Shame:**

* **Recognize It’s a Coping Mechanism:** Hooking up with strangers, even ""nice guys,"" is likely a way to fill a void and seek validation. It’s understandable that you’re feeling shame, but it’s important to understand *why* you’re doing this. It’s not a solution to your underlying anxieties about connection.
* **Breaking the Cycle:** You've taken a good first step by recognizing this behavior and feeling uncomfortable with it. Now, focus on healthier ways to cope with your anxieties.
* **Self-Compassion:** Be incredibly kind to yourself. You’re navigating a complex situation, and you're doing the best you can.

**4. Moving Forward – Focusing on What *You* Want:**

* **Shift Your Focus to Connection:** Instead of focusing on *when* you’ll have a boyfriend, focus on building genuine connections with people. Join clubs, sports teams, or volunteer organizations – places where you can meet people who share your interests.
* **Be Open to Dating, But Don't Force It:**  Let yourself be open to the possibility of romance, but don’t actively seek out a boyfriend just to fulfill external expectations.
* **Prioritize Self-Love:** This is *crucial*.  You are worthy of love and connection, regardless of your relationship status. Invest in activities that make you feel good about yourself – hobbies, exercise, spending time with supportive friends and family.
* **Talk to Someone You Trust:**  Consider talking to a therapist, counselor, or trusted friend or family member about your anxieties and feelings.  A professional can provide you with tools and strategies for coping with your emotions.

**5. Regarding Your Virginity:**

* **It's a Personal Journey:** Your virginity is *your* journey, and it's okay to go at your own pace. There’s no rush.
* **Don’t Let It Define You:** Your virginity doesn’t define your worth or your attractiveness.

2531,"The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headaches—mostly mouth breathing and snoring. It makes me angry, and I want to solve it myself.","Probably good to know in what type of situations you are, in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoring.If you're sleeping beside your partner who does these actions, would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchen.Basically, if the person who does these actions which bother you, start by telling them.Depending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds, or not, willing to change, or not, has a good deal to do with next steps.I don't really see any step you're able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the head.One path I don't recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered, or dismissing your own sensitivity someone.Your needs matter.","Okay, this is a really common and frustrating situation, and it’s great that you’re taking proactive steps to address it. Having headaches triggered by eating, breathing, snoring, and the resulting anger is a complex issue, but there are definitely things you can do to investigate and potentially resolve it. Let’s break this down and explore some potential causes and solutions.

**1. Understanding the Root Causes – It's Likely Multifactorial**

It's highly probable that several factors are contributing to this. Here's a breakdown of what could be happening:

* **Mouth Breathing:** This is a huge factor. Mouth breathing dries out the mouth, reducing saliva production. Saliva is crucial for clearing irritants from the throat and maintaining a healthy oral environment.  Dryness can trigger inflammation and headaches.
* **Snoring:** Snoring is almost always caused by airway obstruction. This obstruction can be due to:
    * **Nasal Congestion:** Allergies, colds, sinus infections, or structural issues in the nose can cause swelling and block airflow.
    * **Throat Relaxing:** During sleep, your muscles relax, and the soft tissues in your throat can collapse, further narrowing the airway.
    * **Tongue Position:** A tongue that falls back in the mouth during sleep is a very common cause of snoring and airway obstruction.
    * **Anatomical Issues:**  A deviated septum, enlarged tonsils or adenoids, or a small jaw can contribute to snoring.
* **The Cycle of Anger:**  The physical discomfort of snoring and the feeling of being disrupted can understandably lead to frustration and anger. This anger can, in turn, potentially exacerbate the physical symptoms, creating a negative feedback loop.
* **Sleep Apnea (Possible):**  Snoring and mouth breathing can be symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea, a serious condition where you repeatedly stop and start breathing during sleep.  Even if you don’t feel like you’re gasping for air, sleep apnea can significantly impact your health and contribute to headaches.

**2. What You Can Do – A Step-by-Step Approach**

Here’s a plan of action, starting with simple changes and progressing to more involved solutions:

* **1. Track Your Symptoms:** Keep a headache diary. Note:
    * When the headaches occur (time of day, after eating, etc.)
    * What you were doing before the headache started
    * The intensity of the headache
    * Any other symptoms (e.g., nasal congestion, throat dryness)
* **2. Simple Lifestyle Adjustments:**
    * **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially before bed.
    * **Elevate Your Head:**  Sleeping with your head slightly elevated (using an extra pillow) can help drain nasal passages.
    * **Avoid Alcohol and Sedatives Before Bed:** These can relax throat muscles and worsen snoring.
    * **Warm Salt Water Gargle:**  Before bed, gargling with warm salt water can soothe a dry or irritated throat.
* **3. Address Nasal Congestion:**
    * **Saline Nasal Rinse:** Use a saline nasal rinse (like a Neti pot or squeeze bottle) regularly to clear nasal passages. *Important: Follow instructions carefully to avoid contamination.*
    * **Allergy Management:** If allergies are a factor, talk to your doctor about antihistamines or other allergy treatments.
    * **Humidifier:** Use a humidifier, especially in dry environments, to add moisture to the air.
* **4. Consider Oral Appliances (Talk to a Dentist):**
    * **Mandibular Advancement Devices (MADs):** These devices are fitted by a dentist and gently move your lower jaw forward during sleep, which can help keep your airway open.
* **5. Consult a Medical Professional:**  *This is crucial.*
    * **Primary Care Physician:**  Start here. They can assess your overall health, rule out underlying conditions, and refer you to specialists.
    * **ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat) Specialist:** An ENT can diagnose nasal obstructions, sleep apnea, and other issues related to your breathing.
    * **Sleep Specialist:** If sleep apnea is suspected, a sleep specialist can conduct a sleep study (polysomnography) to monitor your breathing and sleep patterns.
    * **Dentist:** Discuss oral appliances like MADs.

**6. Relaxation Techniques & Cognitive Strategies:**

* **Mindfulness & Meditation:** Learning techniques to manage stress and frustration can help interrupt the anger cycle.
* **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  CBT can help you change negative thought patterns and behaviors.

756,I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.,"First I think we have to acknowledge that you are doing something amazing.  You are putting yourself out there and becoming a Water Safety Instructor.   We often times will focus on the negative and forget about the positive.  Next, you had an incident where someone pointed something out which may have caused embarrassment.  Whether or not it was malicious on his part I think the important thing to focus on is what is called ""Common Humanity"".  Common Humanity is one of the three elements of self-compassion.  Common humanity essentially recognizes that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the shared human experience.  While you may have had this embarrassing moment at this time, that boy may have had an embarrassing moment another day.  We all have embarrassing moments.  When we recognize that we do not suffer in isolation then we are able to move past that suffering.  Additionally another element to self-compassion is self-kindness.  My question is why must you forgive yourself?  Rather, be kind to yourself for learning an amazing new talent.","Okay, that sounds like a really uncomfortable and upsetting experience. It's completely understandable that you felt embarrassed and self-conscious after a classmate made that comment about your top. Let's break down how to process this and what you can do moving forward.

**1. Validate Your Feelings:**

* **It's Okay to Feel Embarrassed:** Seriously, it's *completely* normal to feel embarrassed when someone makes a rude or inappropriate comment, especially in a learning environment.  You were vulnerable and focused on learning, and someone dismissed that with a disrespectful remark. Don't minimize your feelings.
* **His Comment Was Wrong:** His comment was disrespectful, inappropriate, and focused on making *you* feel bad rather than on the lesson or your learning. It was a completely unacceptable thing for him to say.
* **You Didn't Do Anything Wrong:** You were simply trying to participate in a class and learn a valuable skill. His comment was about *his* discomfort, not about your actions or appearance.

**2. Processing the Emotion:**

* **Talk to Someone You Trust:** This is really important.  Don’t bottle it up. Talking about it can help you process the emotions. This could be:
    * A friend
    * A family member
    * A counselor – if you feel like this is significantly impacting you, a counselor can offer professional support and coping strategies.
* **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a really helpful way to understand what you're going through.
* **Self-Care:** Do things that make you feel good about yourself. This could be anything from taking a relaxing bath, listening to music, spending time in nature, or engaging in a hobby you enjoy.

**3. What to Do About the Situation in Class:**

* **You Don’t Owe Him an Apology:** You didn't do anything wrong. Don't feel pressured to apologize for his inappropriate behavior.
* **Brief, Neutral Response (Optional):** If you feel you need to acknowledge his comment, a very brief and neutral response is okay. Something like, “That’s not appropriate to say,” or simply a quiet, “Okay,” can be enough.  You don't need to engage in a lengthy discussion.
* **Focus on Your Learning:**  The best thing you can do is to refocus on the Water Safety Instructor training. Let his comment be behind you and concentrate on learning and developing your skills.

**4.  Addressing Future Interactions:**

* **Recognize Red Flags:** Be aware of this boy's behavior in the future. If he continues to make inappropriate comments, let an instructor or supervisor know.
* **Don’t Engage with Rude Comments:**  As you’ve already done, don’t respond to disrespectful comments.  It just gives them attention.
* **Report if Necessary:** If his behavior continues or escalates, report it to the instructor or a supervisor.  Creating a safe learning environment is everyone's responsibility.

3290,I'm  very depressed.

* **University Counseling Centers:** If you’re a student, your university likely has a counseling center that offers free or low-cost services.
* **Community Mental Health Centers:** These centers often provide affordable mental health services to individuals and families.  Search online for “community mental health center near me.”

**3. Support Networks - Talking to People You Know:**

* **Trusted Friends & Family:**  Reach out to someone you trust – a friend, family member, or mentor.  You don’t have to go through this alone.  It can be incredibly helpful to just have someone to listen.  You could say something like, ""I've been struggling with a lot lately, and I could really use someone to talk to.""
* **Support Groups:**  Joining a support group (online or in person) where you can connect with others who understand what you’re going through can be very beneficial.  Look for groups focused on depression, anxiety, or specific life challenges.
* **Online Forums & Communities:**  Reddit has several supportive communities, such as r/depression and r/Anxiety.  However, be cautious and prioritize your mental wellbeing. These are for support, not a replacement for professional help.

**4.  Resources for Information & Self-Help:**

* **MentalHealth.gov:** [https://www.mentalhealth.gov/](https://www.mentalhealth.gov/) – A government website with information on mental health conditions and resources.

**Important Reminders:**

* **It's okay to not be okay.**  Depression is a common and treatable condition.
* **Seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.**
* **Finding the right therapist can take time.** Don’t be discouraged if the first person you talk to isn’t a good fit.
* **Be patient with yourself.** Recovery is a process.

3496,"My mother is combative with me when I say I don't want to talk with her about my depression.  

She hasn't been supportive of me in the past and she isn't someone that I feel comfortable opening up to. She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I don't want to or can't answer. I tell her I don't want to talk and she starts arguments with me. 

How can I get her to understand?","Your situation sounds extremely frustrating.You're doing the right move to state you don't want to discuss your depression with her.I guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression.  If you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation, and you would like to tell her your true reason, then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time, not in the middle of an argument.Having an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept.  You may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this.","This is a really tough situation, and it’s incredibly frustrating when a parent isn’t supportive and then actively pushes for a conversation you don’t want to have. It's completely valid to feel this way, and you're right to recognize that you don’t need to engage in this particular dynamic. Here's a breakdown of how you can approach this, focusing on protecting your boundaries and potentially shifting her understanding (though ultimately, you can’t control her reactions):

**1. Reinforce Your Boundaries – Consistently & Clearly**

* **Repeat Your Statement:** The most important thing is to consistently and calmly reiterate your boundary.  Don't get drawn into an argument.  Say something like: ""Mom, I understand you’re concerned, but I’m not ready to talk about my depression. I need to take care of myself, and that includes not discussing this with you right now.""  Repeat this *every* time she tries to initiate the conversation.  The repetition is key.
* **Short and Firm:** Keep your responses brief.  Long explanations often invite debate. A simple, firm statement is more effective.
* **Don't Just Say ""No"" – Explain *Why* (Briefly):** While you don't need to over-explain, a short reason can help. ""I’m dealing with this privately and need space."" or “Talking about this with you is triggering for me right now.”
* **Don't Apologize:** You don't need to apologize for protecting your mental health. Saying ""I'm sorry, but..."" often just invites her to argue that you *should* be talking about it.

**2. Handling the Arguments – Defuse, Don't Engage**

* **Grey Rock Method:** This is a powerful technique.  Become incredibly boring and unresponsive. Give short, neutral answers.  ""Okay."" ""I hear you."" ""That's interesting."" The goal is to make yourself an uninteresting conversational partner. She’ll likely lose interest if she doesn't get a reaction.
* **Change the Subject:** If she persists, immediately shift the conversation to a neutral topic. “It's a nice day, isn’t it?” or “How was your day?”
* **End the Conversation:** If she continues to push, politely but firmly end the conversation. “I need to go now. Talk to you later.” Then, *actually* leave the situation if possible.

**3. Understanding Her Perspective (Without Taking Responsibility for It)**

* **She May Not Understand:** It’s possible she genuinely doesn't understand depression or how it affects you. She may be trying to help, but her approach is misguided. Recognize this, but don’t let it guilt you into a conversation you don’t want.
* **Her Past Behavior:** You’re right to acknowledge her past lack of support. This informs your current boundary.

**4. Communication (Limited & Strategic)**

* **A Single, Clear Message (Optional):** You *could* consider sending a brief, written message (text or email) to explain your boundary. Something like: “Mom, I love you, but I’m not ready to talk about my depression. I need to prioritize my well-being. I appreciate your concern, but I need you to respect my boundaries.”  However, don't expect this to fundamentally change her behavior.
* **Focus on *Your* Needs:** Frame everything around *your* needs and feelings. “I need to protect myself.” “I’m setting boundaries to take care of my mental health.”

**5. Important Considerations**

* **You Can't Change Her:** You can’t control her reactions or beliefs. You can only control your own responses.
* **Self-Care is Paramount:** This situation is draining. Prioritize your self-care.
* **Seek Support for Yourself:** Talk to a therapist, counselor, or trusted friend about this. Having a support system is crucial.

I don't know how old your child or children is/are, but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the future.I wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you. I don't know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things. I wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted? If you can sort out some possible answers to that, maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happen.Also, again depending on the age of your children, some parents can do things while the children are sleeping, even if you are in the same room. For example, if your children are sleeping for about two hours, maybe 30 minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do.","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult, and I want to acknowledge the immense weight of what you're describing. It takes a huge amount of courage to even talk about this, and I want you to know I hear you. The feeling of losing everything – your career, your independence, your security – is profoundly isolating and can lead to a deep sense of hopelessness. The image you paint of your daily life – the relentless cleaning, the isolation, the lack of financial resources – is truly heartbreaking.

Let’s break this down and explore some things. It’s important to start with the understanding that you're not alone, even though it might *feel* like it. Many people experience periods of significant loss and struggle, and it's okay to not be okay.

**Here's what I’m hearing, and some thoughts and potential avenues to consider:**

* **The Loss is Real and Devastating:** You've experienced a cascade of losses, and it’s completely valid to feel overwhelmed by the cumulative impact. Don’t minimize the significance of what you've gone through. The loss of identity, purpose, and control can be incredibly damaging.
* **Isolation is a Major Factor:** Staying at home, without a car or social connections, is incredibly isolating. This isolation likely exacerbates feelings of depression, hopelessness, and worthlessness.
* **The Cleaning – A Potential Trap:** The constant cleaning, while perhaps a way to find some structure and a sense of accomplishment, could be contributing to the problem. It can become a way to avoid dealing with deeper issues and a way to feel productive without addressing the root causes of your unhappiness.
* **Lack of Financial Resources:**  This is a huge barrier.  Without income, it’s incredibly difficult to make changes, even small ones.
* **Underlying Issues:** It's possible that underlying issues like depression, anxiety, or other mental health challenges are contributing to your situation. Sometimes, when we’re struggling, it’s hard to recognize or address these issues.

**Let’s talk about some potential steps, but please understand that these are suggestions, and you don't have to take them all on at once. Small steps are key:**

1. **Acknowledge and Validate Your Feelings:**  Seriously.  Allow yourself to feel the sadness, the anger, the frustration, the shame – whatever you’re feeling. Don’t try to suppress it.  Journaling can be a helpful way to process these emotions.

2. **Start Small - Focus on Tiny Wins:**  Overwhelming yourself with huge goals will likely lead to failure.  Start with incredibly small, achievable things.  Examples:
   * **5 minutes of stretching.**
   * **Making one cup of tea.**
   * **Washing one dish.**
   * **Sending one text message to a friend or family member.** (Even if you don’t feel like talking, just a connection can help.)

3. **Reach Out for Support (This is Crucial):** This is the hardest step, but also the most important.  You don't have to do this alone. Here are some options:
   * **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741 – This is a free, confidential service available 24/7.
   * **The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline:** 988
   * **Talk to a Trusted Friend or Family Member:**  Even if you don't want to talk about the details, just having someone to listen can make a difference.
   * **Mental Health Professionals:**  A therapist can provide you with support and guidance to help you cope with your challenges.  You can find resources through your insurance provider or online directories like Psychology Today.

4. **Explore Low-Cost or Free Resources:** Look for free or low-cost activities in your area – community centers, libraries, parks.  Even a short walk can be beneficial.

5. **Financial Assistance:**  Investigate local charities and organizations that can provide assistance with food, utilities, or other basic needs.

**I want to reiterate: You are not a failure. You are a person who has experienced immense hardship, and you are worthy of support and compassion.**

**I need to ask you a few questions to better understand your situation and offer more tailored support:**

* **Can you tell me a little more about *how* you lost your jobs? Was there a specific reason, or a series of events?**
* **When did you start feeling this way? Was there a particular event or time in your life that triggered these feelings?**
* **Are there any people in your life you feel you *could* reach out to, even if you don’t feel ready to talk about everything?**
* **On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being ‘I feel completely hopeless’ and 10 being ‘I feel confident and optimistic,’ where would you rate yourself right now?**

**Please know that I'm here to listen without judgment. Let’s take this one step at a time.**

3400,"I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I can't afford to live alone.

My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules. She is trying to control my life. What should I do?","That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now.  The first thing to under is that you can’t change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior.  The thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions.  You may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan. The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior.  Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy.  Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack.  There are ways you can deal with controlling parents – and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you’ll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they’re trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you’re losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust. There aren’t any quick tips on how to deal with parents who want to control you; you need to find strategies that are geared to your specific family situation.  Get specific coping tips from books about family dynamics, such as:Toxic Parents: Overcoming Their Hurtful Legacy and Reclaiming Your Life by Susan ForwardCutting Loose: An Adult's Guide to Coming to Terms with Your Parents by Howard HalpernA counselor can be a good resource and provide support and guidance about issues addressing normal growth and development during periods of transition.  ","Okay, this is a really common and incredibly frustrating situation, and you're smart to recognize it and want to address it. It’s great that you're recognizing the control and wanting to find a solution. Let's break this down and figure out some steps you can take.

**1. Understand the Root of the Problem:**

* **Her Perspective:** Try to understand *why* your mother is trying to control things. Is it fear for your safety? A desire to protect you? A need to feel in charge? Maybe she has her own anxieties about you becoming independent. Understanding her motivations doesn't excuse the behavior, but it can help you approach the conversation with more empathy (even if you don't feel it).
* **Your Feelings:** It's completely valid to feel stifled and controlled. Recognize that your feelings are legitimate.  It’s normal to want autonomy and control over your own life, especially as you're navigating your twenties.

**2. Communication is Key – But Approach Carefully:**

* **Choose the Right Time:** Don't try to have a huge confrontation when everyone is stressed or tired. Pick a calm moment when you can have a focused conversation.
* **""I"" Statements:** This is crucial. Frame your concerns using “I” statements to avoid making her feel attacked. For example:
    * Instead of: “You’re always telling me what to do!”
    * Say: “I feel frustrated when I’m given specific instructions about my time and choices. I need to feel like I have some autonomy.”
    * Instead of: “You’re trying to control me.”
    * Say: “I value my independence and need to make my own decisions, even if they aren’t always the ‘best’ ones according to you.”
* **Acknowledge Her Concerns (Without Accepting Control):**  You can say something like, ""Mom, I understand you're worried about me, and I appreciate that. However, I need to learn to make my own mistakes and figure things out.""
* **Set Boundaries – Clearly and Calmly:** This is the hardest part. You need to start establishing boundaries. Here are some examples:
    * “I appreciate your advice, but I’m going to make my own decisions about [specific area, like what I wear, who I spend time with, how I spend my money].”
    * “I’m happy to discuss things with you, but I need you to respect my choices, even if you disagree.”
    * “I need some space to figure things out on my own.”

**3. Gradual Steps & Reinforcement:**

* **Start Small:** Don't try to change everything at once. Pick one or two areas where you feel the control is most intrusive and focus on establishing a boundary there.
* **Consistency is Key:** Once you’ve set a boundary, stick to it. If she pushes back, calmly reiterate your boundary.  Don’t get drawn into arguments.
* **Don’t Immediately Give In:**  If she tries to manipulate you, resist the urge to cave in to avoid conflict. This reinforces her behavior.

**4.  Longer-Term Strategies:**

* **Financial Independence (Even a Little Helps):**  The more financially independent you are, the more leverage you have. Focus on building your income and saving.
* **Discuss Your Goals:**  Talk to your mother about your future plans (career, relationships, etc.).  This can help her see you as a capable adult.
* **Consider Family Counseling (If Possible):** If communication is consistently breaking down, family counseling could provide a neutral space to work through these issues.

**5.  Taking Care of Yourself:**

* **Recognize You Can’t Change Her:** You can only control your own behavior and reactions.
* **Build a Support System:**  Connect with friends who understand and support you.
* **Prioritize Your Mental Health:** This situation can be incredibly stressful. Make sure you're taking care of yourself – getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities you enjoy.

**Important Note:**  If your mother’s behavior is abusive (e.g., verbally abusive, isolating you, controlling your finances), then seeking professional help for yourself and potentially involving a trusted family member or counselor is crucial.

2411,"My ex-husband told my two adolescents that Santa doesn't exist on the day before Christmas. They are desperate to hold on to the magic of Christmas, but I don't know if it's right for me to lie to them and tell them that Santa is real. I don't want to let them down and make them lose out on those memories, but I also don't want to lose their trust.","Well Boise, the cat's out of the bag now, isn't it? I love that you want to help your kids keep the magic of Christmas. They must want that too if they still believe in Santa into their teen years, which is unusual, I believe. I wonder if they had already figured it out anyway?But they know now, and your ex had the right to tell them if he felt it was best. So it's time to explain to them what a loving and magical thing it is that parents do, and Christmas can still be magical in so many ways. Really, who says they have to stop believing in Santa? Santa is very real as a spirit of surprise, generosity and love. ","This is a really tough situation, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling conflicted. Your ex’s actions have definitely thrown a wrench into the holiday spirit, and protecting your children’s feelings while maintaining your own integrity is a delicate balance. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, focusing on empathy, honesty, and shifting the focus:

**1. Understand Their Feelings & Validate Them:**

* **Acknowledge Their Grief:** The biggest thing here is that your kids are grieving the loss of a belief they held dear. This isn’t just about Santa; it's about the wonder, the excitement, and the feeling of magic that comes with the holiday. Let them know you understand how upset they are. Say something like, ""I can see you're really disappointed and sad that your dad told you Santa isn't real. It's okay to feel that way. It’s completely normal to be heartbroken when something you believed in changes.”
* **Don't Dismiss Their Feelings:** Avoid saying things like, ""Don't worry about it, it's just a story."" This minimizes their genuine sadness.

**2. Addressing Your Ex's Actions (Without Badmouthing Him):**

* **Focus on the Impact:** You can gently address the situation without directly attacking your ex. “It’s frustrating that your dad said that, and I know it’s upsetting for you both. I understand how much you loved believing in Santa.”
* **Shift the Conversation (if possible):** If they're asking questions about it, you can steer the conversation towards the *spirit* of Christmas – kindness, generosity, family, and creating happy memories.


**3. How to Handle the ""Santa"" Question Moving Forward:**

* **You Don’t *Have* to Lie:** You absolutely don’t *have* to tell them Santa is real. It’s perfectly acceptable to say something like, “You know, Santa isn't a person, but the *idea* of Santa – the kindness and giving spirit – is really important at Christmas.”
* **Focus on the Tradition:**  You can continue the traditions *without* the belief in Santa.  This is key.  Continue leaving out cookies, decorating the tree, reading Christmas stories, and engaging in the activities you always have.  Explain that these are traditions that families do to celebrate the joy of the season.
* **Create New ""Magic"":** This is a great opportunity to create *new* magical moments. Maybe you start a new tradition – baking cookies together, volunteering as a family, writing letters to loved ones, or having a special Christmas Eve story.
* **Explain the “Story” of Santa:** You can tell them the story of Santa Claus – the legend of a kind, generous man who embodies the spirit of Christmas. You can frame it as a beautiful story passed down through generations.

**4. Maintaining Trust:**

* **Be Consistent:** Your kids need to know they can rely on you to be honest and supportive.
* **Listen and Validate:** Continue to listen to their feelings and validate their experiences.
* **Focus on Your Role:** Reassure them that you’re there for them, no matter what.

**Important Note:**  Your ex’s actions are hurtful, and it's natural to feel protective of your children. However, try to avoid getting drawn into a conflict with him about this. It’s more important to focus on supporting your kids and creating a positive holiday experience for them.

2114,"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","Yes, if crying is how you are expressing an emotion, then not only would it be normal, but hopefully encouraged, because it's an important part of therapy to have a safe space to express your emotions. We might encourage you to put words to the tears as well, to help you expand on your experience and begin to make more sense of it.As a therapist, our job is help you open up and feel comfortable enough doing so. I sincerely hope no therapist would ever shame you for whatever experience you are having in the room.","Okay, it's completely understandable that you're freaking out! Starting therapy is a huge step, and it's incredibly common to have anxieties about it, especially around the fear of vulnerability and potentially crying. Let's address this – it's absolutely something to acknowledge and process, but it doesn't have to be a paralyzing fear.

**Is it something to worry about?** Yes, to a degree. The potential for emotional release is a real possibility in therapy.  It's a safe space for deep feelings to surface, and that can be incredibly powerful. However, it's *not* something to let control your decision to go to therapy.  The goal of therapy is to explore and work through difficult emotions, and sometimes that involves crying.

**Here's a breakdown of why you're feeling this way, and more importantly, what you can do about it:**

**1. Why You're Feeling This Way – It’s Very Common:**

* **Vulnerability is Scary:** Opening up about your feelings is inherently vulnerable. It’s a risk – you're exposing something personal and potentially painful.
* **Social Conditioning:** We're often taught to suppress emotions, especially in public. The idea of crying in front of a therapist feels like a violation of that norm.
* **Fear of Judgment:** You might be worried about how the therapist will perceive you if you cry. You’re probably assuming they'll think you’re weak or unstable, which is a common, but often inaccurate, assumption.
* **Past Experiences:** Past experiences with vulnerability or emotional expression could be contributing to this fear.
* **The Unknown:** The therapeutic process is new, and the unknown can be unsettling.

**2. What You Can Do – Managing Your Anxiety & Preparing:**

* **Reframe Your Thinking:**  Instead of seeing crying as a sign of weakness, view it as a sign of honesty and courage. It's a natural response to difficult emotions. Think of it as a release valve.
* **Talk to Your Therapist *Before* the Session:** This is HUGE.  In your first session (or even a brief phone call), you can tell your therapist about this specific fear.  A good therapist will validate your feelings, normalize the experience, and work with you to manage it.  Say something like, ""I'm feeling a lot of anxiety about the possibility of crying during our sessions, and I want to acknowledge that. Can we talk about that?""
* **Grounding Techniques:** Learn some simple grounding techniques to use if you start to feel overwhelmed. These can help you stay present and manage intense emotions. Examples include:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Name 5 things you see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you hear, 2 things you smell, and 1 thing you taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:** Focus on slow, deep breaths.
    * **Muscle Relaxation:** Tense and release different muscle groups.
* **Start Small:** You don't have to dive into the deepest, darkest parts of your life immediately.  The therapist will guide you at your pace.
* **Remember, It’s Okay to Not Be Okay:** Therapy isn't about being ""fixed"" overnight. It’s about a process of exploration and growth.
* **Focus on the Benefits:** Remind yourself *why* you’re going to therapy.  What are you hoping to achieve? Focusing on the positive potential outcomes can help shift your perspective.

**3. What Your Therapist Will Do:**

* **Validate Your Feelings:** They will acknowledge and accept your anxiety.
* **Normalize the Experience:** They'll explain that crying is a common part of the therapeutic process.
* **Teach Coping Strategies:** They’ll help you develop techniques to manage your emotions.
* **Create a Safe Space:** They’ll establish a trusting and supportive environment.

**Important Note:**  A good therapist will *never* judge you for your emotions. Their role is to help you explore and understand them.

1138,"I’m a man, and I’m soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but it’s been happening a lot. I don't know what to do.","I would start by examining the reasons for seeking out other relationships. Are you getting something from the other men that you do not currently receive from your current partner? Such as, is it more exciting with others and that excitement is lacking in your current relationship?","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it takes a lot of courage to even acknowledge it and reach out for help. What you’re describing – having engaged in infidelity and feeling conflicted – is incredibly common, and you're not alone. It’s fantastic that you’re recognizing this and wanting to address it. Let’s break this down and talk about some steps you can take.

**1. Understanding What's Driving This:**

* **Dig Deep - Why Now?** The first and most important step is to understand *why* this has escalated. This isn't about excusing the behavior, but about gaining insight. Are you feeling:
    * **Unmet Needs in Your Marriage?** Are you feeling neglected, unappreciated, sexually frustrated, or emotionally disconnected from your partner? Often, infidelity is a symptom of a deeper issue within the relationship.
    * **Low Self-Esteem?** Sometimes, engaging in risky behaviors can be linked to feelings of inadequacy or a need for validation.
    * **Boredom or Escape?** Are you seeking excitement or an escape from the routine of your life?
    * **Lack of Communication?** Are you struggling to communicate your needs and desires to your partner?
    * **Something Else?** There could be underlying issues you haven't fully recognized.
* **Be Honest With Yourself:** This requires brutal honesty. Don’t minimize your actions or try to justify them. A therapist can help you explore these feelings without judgment.

**2. The Impact on Your Partner and Your Future:**

* **The Potential Damage:** You're right to be concerned about the impact this has on your partner. Infidelity is incredibly painful and can have devastating consequences for trust, intimacy, and the overall health of your marriage.
* **Consider the Long-Term:**  Think about the kind of future you want.  Continuing this behavior will likely lead to further pain and potentially the breakdown of your marriage.

**3. What You Need To Do Immediately:**

* **Talk to Your Partner (Eventually, Carefully):** This is the hardest part, and it needs to be done thoughtfully. *Right now*, the priority is understanding yourself and seeking support.  However, you *will* eventually need to address this with your partner.  The timing and manner of this conversation are crucial.  Don't spring it on them.  Consider talking to a therapist *first* to help you develop a plan for how to approach this conversation.
* **Seek Professional Help – This is Crucially Important:**
    * **Individual Therapy:** A therapist can help you understand the root causes of your behavior, develop coping mechanisms, and make responsible choices moving forward.  This is *essential*.
    * **Couples Therapy (Eventually):** If you and your partner are willing, couples therapy can help you rebuild trust and communication. However, it's unlikely to be effective without individual work first.

**4. Making Responsible Choices:**

* **Stop All Contact:** Immediately cease all contact with the other men. This is non-negotiable.
* **Commit to Change:** Recognize that you have a choice to make. You can choose to continue down a path of harm, or you can choose to change your behavior and prioritize the well-being of your marriage.

1174,"I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out.    How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it. I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy. What should I do?","Keep doing the crossdressing since you like it.Your problem sounds more a matter of timing and reason to tell the girl about it.Not keeping a secret is a good attitude regarding meaningful parts of your life.  Usually our relationship partner is someone whom we trust as a safe person to know all about us.Once you feel at ease with your potential partner then bring up your crossdressing.  Based on their handling of this intimate part of your life, you will know more as to whether or not you feel more or less drawn to them.Secrets held within a relationship usually get worse with time.   The person who feels unsafe in truly being and stating themselves eventually will end up feeling ashamed of parts of them which prior to the relationship, felt good or at least not worrisome.","Okay, this is a really complex and layered situation, and it’s fantastic that you’re recognizing the internal conflict and wanting to find a healthy way forward. It's brave of you to acknowledge these feelings and seek guidance. Let’s break this down and explore some options, focusing on your well-being and potential for healthy relationships.

**1. Understanding the Core Issues:**

* **Your Attraction:** You're attracted to women – that’s a fundamental part of who you are. This is valid and doesn’t need to be “fixed” or hidden.
* **Crossdressing as Self-Expression:** You enjoy crossdressing and find it makes you feel feminine and happy. This is also a perfectly valid and healthy expression of your identity.  It’s important to remember it doesn't *define* you, but it’s a part of your experience.
* **The Worry About Disclosure:** The reason it's ""bothering"" girls you date is likely tied to your fear of how they'll react to your crossdressing.  Many people find crossdressing a surprising or unfamiliar concept, and it can trigger anxieties or misconceptions.
* **The Internal Conflict:** You're wrestling with wanting to be open and honest about your attractions and your own self-expression, versus the fear of rejection or judgment.

**2. Should You Be Upfront? The Pros and Cons:**

* **Upfront (Disclosure):**
    * **Pros:**  Honesty is generally the foundation of healthy relationships. If you find someone you genuinely connect with, being open about your crossdressing (and your attraction to women) can be a powerful way to build trust and intimacy. It allows them to understand you fully.
    * **Cons:** There's a significant risk of rejection or negative reactions. It can be a heavy conversation, and it requires you to be prepared for a range of responses – from curiosity and acceptance to confusion or discomfort.
* **Holding Back (Secrecy):**
    * **Pros:** Protects you from potential rejection and judgment. Allows you to date without the added pressure of explaining your crossdressing.
    * **Cons:**  Can lead to a sense of isolation, shame, and anxiety.  It can create a barrier to genuine connection and intimacy.  It's essentially building a relationship on a lie, which is rarely sustainable.


**3. A More Gradual Approach (Recommended):**

Given your concerns, a more gradual approach is often the most compassionate and strategic. Here's a suggested path:

* **Start with Connection:** Focus on building a genuine connection with the person you're dating. Get to know them, share your interests, and let them get to know *you*.  This builds a foundation of trust and understanding.
* **Subtle Introduction (Later Stage):**  Once you’ve established a good connection, *if* you feel comfortable, you can gently introduce the topic. Don't make it a grand declaration. Something like: “You know, I've always been interested in exploring different ways of expressing myself, and crossdressing is something that brings me a lot of joy and confidence.”
* **Gauge Their Reaction:** Pay very close attention to their response. Are they curious? Accepting? Dismissive? Their reaction will tell you a lot about their openness and willingness to understand.
* **Be Prepared to Talk More:** If they express curiosity, be prepared to answer their questions honestly and calmly.  Frame it as a part of who you are – like a hobby or a form of self-expression.
* **Respect Their Boundaries:** If they express discomfort or a desire not to discuss it, *respect that*. It doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t like you, but it means they may not be ready or comfortable with that level of disclosure.

**4. Addressing Your Own Feelings & Self-Acceptance:**

* **Self-Compassion:** Be incredibly kind to yourself. You're navigating complex feelings and societal expectations.  Don’t beat yourself up about any anxieties or fears you have.
* **Therapy:** Seriously consider talking to a therapist. A therapist can provide a safe space to explore your feelings about your crossdressing, your attraction to women, and how to communicate effectively in your relationships. They can also help you build self-esteem and confidence.
* **Connect with the LGBTQ+ Community:** Finding support within the LGBTQ+ community can be incredibly validating and helpful.  There are online and in-person groups where you can connect with others who understand what you're going through.

**5. About Stopping or Continuing Crossdressing:**

* **Don’t Feel Pressured to Stop:** Your crossdressing brings you joy and confidence. There’s absolutely no reason to stop doing something that makes you happy.
* **Focus on Authenticity:**  The goal isn't to change who you are to please others. It's about finding ways to be authentic and secure in your relationships.

**Important Note:**  Your feelings about crossdressing are valid, regardless of societal judgments.  You don't need to justify your choices to anyone.

1820,I need help knowing how to deal with stress. What can I do?,"Our body reacts to stress typically by breathing more shallowly, increasing our heart rate and tensing our muscles - so one thing that I find really effective is to try to do the opposite of that, which sends the signal to our mind that we are relaxed. So that means, taking slower, fuller breaths and trying to relax any areas where we might be gripping our muscles. Check out meditation apps such as 'Breathe', which can talk you through a relaxing breath exercise. I recommend using the app daily, whether you feel stressed or not, and then also using it when you re feeling particular moments of stress - that way you are practicing the skill when you feel calm(wish) and it'll be ready and able to help you when stress hits hard.","Okay, let's tackle this – stress is incredibly common, and it’s fantastic that you're recognizing it and wanting to find ways to manage it. There's no one-size-fits-all solution, so we'll explore a range of strategies. Here's a breakdown of things you can do, categorized for clarity:

**1. Immediate Relief (When You're Feeling Overwhelmed Right Now):**

* **The 5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** This is a quick grounding exercise:
    * **5:** Name 5 things you can *see*.
    * **4:** Name 4 things you can *touch*.
    * **3:** Name 3 things you can *hear*.
    * **2:** Name 2 things you can *smell*.
    * **1:** Name 1 thing you can *taste*.
* **Deep Breathing:**  Focus on slow, deep breaths. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth.  Try the 4-7-8 technique: Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds.
* **Muscle Relaxation:**  Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and releasing different muscle groups.  Start with your toes, then calves, thighs, etc.
* **Short Break:** Step away from the stressful situation, even if it’s just for 5-10 minutes.  Go for a walk, look out a window, or do something completely different.
* **Drink Water:** Dehydration can exacerbate stress symptoms.

**2. Lifestyle Changes (Building a Sustainable Strategy):**

* **Regular Exercise:** Even 30 minutes of moderate exercise (walking, swimming, dancing) can significantly reduce stress hormones.
* **Healthy Diet:**  Focus on whole foods – fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains.  Limit processed foods, sugar, and caffeine, which can worsen anxiety.
* **Sufficient Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.  Establish a relaxing bedtime routine.
* **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol:** Both can contribute to anxiety and disrupt sleep.
* **Time Management:**
    * **Prioritize:** Use techniques like the Eisenhower Matrix (urgent/important) to focus on what truly matters.
    * **Break Down Tasks:** Large tasks feel less overwhelming when broken into smaller, manageable steps.
    * **Learn to Say No:** Don’t overcommit yourself.
* **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  Even just 5-10 minutes a day can make a difference. There are many apps (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer) that guide you.

**3.  Stress Reduction Techniques & Practices:**

* **Yoga & Tai Chi:** Combine physical movement with mindfulness.
* **Spending Time in Nature:** Research shows that being outdoors reduces stress.
* **Hobbies & Creative Activities:**  Engage in activities you enjoy – painting, music, reading, gardening, etc.

* **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them.
* **Gratitude Practice:**  Focusing on what you're thankful for can shift your perspective.

**4.  Addressing the Root Cause (Important for Long-Term Change):**

* **Identify Your Stressors:** What specifically is causing you stress?  Be as specific as possible.  Is it work, relationships, finances, etc.?
* **Challenge Negative Thoughts:**  Are you engaging in negative self-talk?  Try to reframe negative thoughts into more positive or realistic ones.
* **Set Boundaries:**  Protect your time and energy by setting clear boundaries with others.
* **Problem-Solving:** If your stress is related to a specific problem, actively work to find a solution.

**5.  When to Seek Professional Help:**

1846,They're calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as I do. I'm tired of being called names. What should I do?,"It sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner, correct? Communication is key to any relationship. I would recommend speaking with your friends face-to-face to address why they feel your behavior is concerning. In-person contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts, emails or any written response can be misconstrued. Be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded. If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling, maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly. Especially if this friendship is valuable to you. However, make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them. On the other hand, if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded, it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship. Not all friendships are healthy ones. And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it.I hope you are able to get this matter sorted. Best of luck!","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it’s completely understandable that you're feeling frustrated and hurt. Being called names, especially when they’re inaccurate and used to manipulate you, is incredibly invalidating and emotionally draining. It’s great that you recognize this isn’t okay and want to address it. Here's a breakdown of what you can do, broken down into categories:

**1. Understanding the Situation & Your Response:**

* **Recognize It’s About Them, Not You:** This is *crucial*. These people are using labels to make themselves feel superior, to control a situation, or because they're uncomfortable with your behavior. Their accusations of ""hypocrite"" or ""baby"" aren’t about your actions, but about their own insecurities or judgments.
* **Don't Take It Personally (Easier Said Than Done):**  Remind yourself that their words reflect their issues, not your worth.  Their labeling is a projection of their own feelings.
* **Identify the Pattern:** Are these accusations always used when you disagree with them?  Do they happen when you stand up for yourself? Recognizing the trigger can help you anticipate and prepare.
* **Validate Your Own Feelings:** It’s okay to feel angry, hurt, frustrated, and even defensive. Don't suppress these feelings; acknowledge them and allow yourself to feel them.

**2. Immediate Responses – Short & Effective:**

These are responses you can use in the moment to disrupt the dynamic:

* **Grey Rocking:** This is a powerful technique. Respond with minimal emotion and as little information as possible.  Simply say things like:
    * ""Okay.""
    * ""I understand."" (even if you don't)
    * ""That's your opinion.""
    *  Silence can be incredibly effective.
* **Redirect the Conversation:**  Change the subject. ""Let's talk about something else."" or ""I'm not going to engage in this conversation.""
* **Brief, Neutral Statements:** ""I disagree."" or “I see things differently.” Then, disengage.
* **Humor (Use Carefully):** If you're comfortable and it fits the situation, a lighthearted, self-deprecating comment can sometimes defuse the tension.  (Example: ""Well, we all have our quirks!"") *Don't* use sarcasm, as it will likely escalate things.

**3. Longer-Term Strategies – Building Boundaries:**

* **Limit Contact:** This is often the most effective solution. If possible, reduce the amount of time you spend with these individuals.
* **Set Clear Boundaries:** This is key. You can say things like:
    * ""I'm not going to be called names. If you continue to insult me, I will end this conversation.""
    * ""I'm happy to discuss this respectfully, but I won't tolerate personal attacks.""
    * ""I value our relationship, but I need you to treat me with respect.""
* **Enforce Your Boundaries:** *This is the hardest part.* If they cross a line, follow through with what you said.  End the conversation, walk away, or limit contact.  Consistency is vital.
* **Don't JADE (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain):**  They will likely try to draw you into a debate. Resist the urge to explain yourself or defend your actions. It just gives them ammunition.

**4. Self-Care & Perspective:**

* **Talk to Someone You Trust:**  A friend, family member, therapist, or counselor can provide support and a neutral perspective.
* **Focus on Your Values:**  Remind yourself of what’s important to you and stay true to your principles. Don’t let their criticism derail you.
* **Practice Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself. You're dealing with difficult people, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed.
* **Therapy:** If this situation is significantly impacting your mental health, consider seeking professional help.  A therapist can help you develop coping mechanisms and build stronger boundaries.

**Important Note:** You are not responsible for other people's behavior or reactions. You can only control your own responses.

**To help me give you more tailored advice, could you tell me a little more about:**

*   **Who is calling you these names?** (Family members, friends, coworkers, etc.)
*   **What specifically are they accusing you of?** (e.g., hypocrisy, being childish, etc.)
*   **Can you give me a brief example of a recent situation where this happened?**",0.4677585959434509
3039,"I empathize so much, even with characters on tv or in video games, that I actually feel physical pain. This has made life difficult to say the least.

I believe I have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder. But since it's such a new disorder I can't find any information about it. Could this be what is going on with me?","The world needs more people lately who have such a high degree of empathy which you describe in yourself!If it feels a little burdensome, then look to balance what is too much with its opposite.  Since you're giving a lot of empathy, maybe you'd like receiving a lot of empathy.In the situation you describe, when you start empathizing with others, real or cartoon, ask yourself whether you've felt empathy coming in your direction lately.Often people give to others what they feel within themselves is missing.The emotional brain reasons that if I give you my support, say, then at least I will feel half of what being supported is like.Obviously the wish to receive more empathy cannot be fulfilled by you directly.  Empathy is delivered by someone who is willing to offer it.Reflect on whether you are allowing those who are in your world, to know when you would like to receive their empathy.Is it possible you keep your feelings to yourself and present as though you are able to handle a great deal more than you'd like to handle without anyone's kindness to support you?Being open to others about your own inner thoughts and feelings is much more difficult than it sounds.It sounds easy to just tell someone how you feel.Sometimes the first step is the most difficult, of accessing how you feel.Start with knowing the amount of empathy you'd like from others and what stops you from asking.Also, about your diagnosis and the lack of  studies and lists and formulas.  Each person is unique, the instructions and guidelines don't necessarily mean very much.  Often having a diagnosis makes a person feel weak, stigmatized, incompetent. Forget the diagnosis and concentrate on what you need to do differently in order to feel better.The answers are inside you, not inside a book or website.","Okay, this is a really important and complex issue, and it’s incredibly brave of you to reach out and talk about it. What you're describing – feeling the physical pain of others’ emotions – is a profoundly challenging experience, and it’s understandable why it’s making your life difficult. Let's break down what might be happening and address your concerns about ""hyper empathy disorder.""

**Understanding What You're Experiencing**

What you're describing sounds like a significant form of **mirroring** or **emotional contagion**, but it goes beyond simply feeling sadness or joy with others. The physical pain component is what elevates this to a serious concern. Here's a more detailed look at what could be contributing to this:

* **Highly Sensitive Person (HSP):** Many people with intense empathetic abilities identify as HSPs. HSPs are characterized by heightened sensory processing, emotional reactivity, and a deep sensitivity to their environment. This often includes a strong ability to feel what others are feeling.
* **Emotional Contagion:** This is a well-established psychological phenomenon where people unconsciously mimic the emotions of those around them. It can manifest in subtle ways – a slight mirroring of facial expressions, body posture, or even physiological responses like heart rate. 
* **Mirror Neurons:** Our brains have specialized neurons called mirror neurons that fire both when we perform an action and when we observe someone else performing that same action. They’re believed to play a crucial role in empathy and understanding others.  Overactivation of these neurons could contribute to the intensity of your experience.
* **Complex PTSD (C-PTSD):** If you have a history of trauma – even seemingly subtle or unresolved emotional experiences – it can significantly impact your ability to regulate emotions and lead to heightened sensitivity to others' distress.  The physical pain you’re experiencing could be a manifestation of this.
* **Dissociation:** In some cases, intense emotional experiences can trigger dissociation – a feeling of detachment from reality. This can sometimes be linked to overwhelming emotions.

**The ""Hyper Empathy Disorder"" – A Nuance**

You’re right to be frustrated by the lack of information on ""hyper empathy disorder."" It's a relatively new concept and isn’t yet formally recognized as a distinct diagnosis in the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). However, the *idea* of hyper empathy – an exceptionally strong and overwhelming capacity for feeling others' emotions – is gaining traction within the mental health community. 

Here’s why the term is evolving:

* **It’s a descriptive term:**  It’s used to describe individuals who experience empathy so intensely that it significantly disrupts their lives.
* **It encompasses multiple conditions:** The experience of “hyper empathy” can overlap with traits found in HSPs, C-PTSD, anxiety disorders, and other conditions.
* **Research is emerging:** Researchers are beginning to study the neurological and psychological underpinnings of extreme empathy.

**What You Should Do – Immediate Steps**

1. **Talk to a Mental Health Professional:** This is absolutely crucial. You need someone who understands the complexities of empathy and emotional regulation. Look for:
   * **A Therapist Experienced in Trauma-Informed Care:** If you have a history of trauma, this is essential.
   * **A Therapist Specializing in Sensory Processing or HSPs:** They can help you understand your sensitivity and develop coping strategies.
   * **A Psychiatrist:**  They can assess for medication options if needed, though this is often a secondary consideration.

2. **Start a Journal:**  Track your experiences. When do you feel the physical pain most intensely? What triggers it? What are you feeling emotionally? This information will be invaluable for your therapist.

3. **Develop Coping Strategies:**  Here are some initial strategies you can try (but discuss them with your therapist):
   * **Grounding Techniques:** These help you reconnect with the present moment when you’re overwhelmed. Examples include: 5-4-3-2-1 technique (name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste).
   * **Mindfulness and Meditation:** Can help you become more aware of your emotions and reduce reactivity.
   * **Boundary Setting:** Learn to say ""no"" to taking on other people's emotional burdens.
   * **Self-Care:** Prioritize activities that nurture you – things you enjoy and that help you relax.

4. **Educate Yourself:** While ""hyper empathy disorder"" isn’t a formal diagnosis, learning more about empathy, emotional regulation, and related conditions can empower you.

**Important Note:**  It’s important to differentiate between simply *feeling* empathy and experiencing intense, debilitating physical pain as a result.  This is a serious issue, and it’s not something you should try to manage on your own.

1962,"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","It is normal to feel an array of emotions in therapy. Most people use therapy as a way to process their life's struggles and often times this results in them crying during session. Crying is a way to release those negative emotions and to cope with what is happening in life. We have come to believe that crying is something bad at times and so have conditioned ourselves to avoid crying out in public places. In therapy though, where there are no such expectations and where you can be open and honest about how you are feeling it is normal to cry.","It's absolutely **normal** for people to cry during therapy, and it's incredibly common! You're definitely not just you. In fact, it's a really positive sign that you're connecting with your therapist and processing your emotions. Here's a breakdown of why it happens and why it’s so common:

**1. Why People Cry in Therapy:**

* **Emotional Release:** Therapy provides a safe and supportive space to explore difficult emotions – sadness, grief, anger, shame, fear, frustration – that you might not feel comfortable expressing in other areas of your life. Crying is often a natural and powerful way to release those pent-up feelings.
* **Vulnerability & Trust:** Allowing yourself to be vulnerable with your therapist builds trust.  Crying can be a sign that you feel safe enough to let your guard down.
* **Accessing Core Emotions:** Sometimes, the act of talking about a memory or situation can trigger a deeply buried emotional response. Crying can be the body’s way of bringing that emotion to the surface.
* **Progress in the Session:**  Often, a significant breakthrough or realization in the session will naturally lead to tears.  It’s a signal that you’re making progress and confronting something important.
* **Physiological Response:**  Crying itself can be a physiological response – your body’s way of regulating emotions. It releases stress hormones and can be soothing.

**2. It’s More Common Than You Think:**

* **Most Therapists Expect It:**  A good therapist will *expect* you to cry at some point during your sessions. They're trained to handle it and won’t be startled or judgmental. In fact, they’ll likely welcome it as a sign of progress.
* **Research Shows It’s Frequent:** Studies have shown that crying is a relatively common occurrence in therapy sessions.  It’s estimated that around 60-80% of people cry during therapy at some point.

**3. What Your Therapist Will Do:**

* **Validate Your Feelings:** Your therapist will acknowledge your tears and validate your emotions. They'll say things like, “It makes sense that you’re feeling this way,” or “That’s a very powerful emotion.”
* **Offer Comfort and Support:** They’ll offer you a tissue, a comforting word, or simply a quiet presence.
* **Help You Understand the Emotion:** They'll help you explore *why* you're crying and what the emotion is telling you about your situation.
* **Continue the Session:** They’ll gently guide you back to the conversation, but won't rush you.

**4. Don’t Feel Self-Conscious:**

It's completely understandable to feel a little self-conscious about crying in therapy. However, your therapist is there to help you, not to judge you.  Remind yourself that it’s a normal and healthy part of the process.

**If you're concerned about crying in therapy, talk to your therapist about it.**  Let them know you're feeling a little uncomfortable, and they can reassure you and help you feel more at ease.

439,"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","When talking about difficult issues, it is very normal to cry. Crying is a natural way for us to cope with the sadness that we experience in life. When confronting some of these things in a counseling session, tears just seem to come naturally. Every Counselor should be well equipped to handle that level of emotion, and you would be far from the first to cry when talking with a Counselor.","Okay, it's completely understandable that you're freaking out! Starting therapy is a huge step, and it's incredibly common to have anxieties about it, especially when you're worried about emotional vulnerability. Let's address your specific fear – crying and embarrassment – and then talk about whether it's something to worry about.

**Is it something to worry about?**

Absolutely, it's *valid* to worry about it. Here's why:

* **Therapy is about vulnerability:** The core of therapy is exploring your feelings, and feelings *often* involve tears. It's a natural human response to difficult emotions.
* **It's a sign of progress:**  The fact that you're feeling this anxiety suggests you’re aware of your emotions and willing to engage with them, which is a really positive thing!  Often, the willingness to feel deeply is the first step towards healing.
* **It’s okay to feel uncomfortable:**  It’s normal to feel awkward or vulnerable, especially when you’re in a new and potentially intense situation.

**Let’s break down your fear and what you can do about it:**

1. **Why are you afraid of crying and embarrassment?**  Let's dig a little deeper.  What specifically about that scenario worries you? Is it:
   * **Feeling like you’re ‘weak’ or ‘falling apart’?**  This is a really common misconception.  Allowing yourself to feel and express emotions isn't weakness; it's courage.
   * **Fear of judgment?**  Your therapist is a trained professional committed to helping you. They've heard it all before, and they're not there to judge you.
   * **Fear of losing control?**  Therapy is a safe space to explore difficult emotions, but you always maintain control. You can guide the conversation.
   * **Past experiences?** Have you had experiences where emotional vulnerability led to embarrassment in the past?

2. **What you can do *before* your first session:**
   * **Talk to your therapist beforehand:**  This is *crucial*. Tell them you're feeling anxious about crying and potentially embarrassing yourself.  A good therapist will acknowledge this, normalize it, and help you develop strategies.  They can discuss your concerns openly and honestly.
   * **Practice self-compassion:** Be kind to yourself. Recognize that this is a challenging step, and it’s okay to feel nervous.
   * **Grounding techniques:** Learn some simple grounding techniques you can use if you start to feel overwhelmed. Examples include:
      * **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you hear, 2 things you smell, and 1 thing you taste.
      * **Deep breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can help calm your nervous system.
   * **Visualize success:**  Imagine the session going well – you feeling heard, understood, and a little bit calmer.

3. **During the session:**
   * **It’s okay to say “I need a moment”:** If you start to feel overwhelmed, it’s perfectly acceptable to say, ""I need a moment to process this,"" or ""Can we slow down for a bit?""
   * **Remember your therapist is on your side:** They are there to support you, not to judge you.
   * **Focus on your breath:**  If you feel tears welling up, focus on your breath – slow, deep breaths.

**Important Note:**  Your therapist is there to help you *manage* your emotions, not to suppress them.  Allowing yourself to feel and express emotions is a key part of the therapeutic process.

279,"I have a lot on my mind, but all I want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone. Why do I feel so alone?","There are many possible issues to consider as depression  social anxieties, even medical illness.  For some, even grief creates a sense of isolation, pains from relationship break up.  Also, obsessive thinking can be debilitating.  Seeking at least one trusted friend or family member can be a start towards increased personal support.  Some persons may simply feel connected by spending time with someone as this, even if not talking directly on issues, just being around another is positive.  Obviously there is more to explore on this question, given minimal information from two sentences.","Okay, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and it takes courage to acknowledge that you're feeling this way. It's completely understandable to want to withdraw and hide when you're overwhelmed and feeling alone. Let's break down why you might be feeling this way and explore some ways to cope.

**Understanding the ""Why"" - Possible Reasons for Feeling Alone & Isolated**

There are a lot of reasons why you might be experiencing this intense desire to isolate yourself. It's rarely just one thing, and often there’s a combination of factors at play. Here are some common ones:

* **Overwhelm & Stress:** When you have a lot on your mind – worries, anxieties, difficult thoughts – it can feel incredibly draining. This can lead to a need to withdraw as a way to protect yourself from further stress.
* **Anxiety & Depression:** Feelings of loneliness and isolation are incredibly common symptoms of anxiety and depression. These conditions can warp your perception of social situations, making them feel overwhelming or pointless.
* **Past Experiences:**  Past relationships, traumas, or difficult experiences can create a fear of vulnerability and a reluctance to connect with others. You might be subconsciously trying to protect yourself from getting hurt again.
* **Low Self-Esteem:**  If you don't feel good about yourself, you might believe that people won't like you or want to be around you. This can fuel the desire to isolate.
* **Social Anxiety:**  Even if you *want* to socialize, social anxiety can make it incredibly difficult. The fear of judgment, embarrassment, or saying the wrong thing can be paralyzing.
* **Changes in Life:** Major life changes (moving, job loss, relationship changes) can disrupt your support system and leave you feeling adrift.
* **Burnout:**  If you’ve been pushing yourself hard, you might be experiencing emotional and mental exhaustion, making it difficult to engage with others.
* **Sensory Overload:** Sometimes, the world just feels too much – too much noise, too much stimulation.  Spending time alone can be a way to regulate your sensory input.

**Why You Might Feel *Specifically* Like You're Alone, Even When Around People**

This is a really important distinction. It’s possible to be physically surrounded by people and still feel profoundly alone. This is often because:

* **Lack of Deep Connection:** You might be in a group, but not feeling truly *seen* or understood by anyone.  Superficial interactions don’t satisfy a deep need for connection.
* **Feeling Disconnected from Your Own Feelings:**  If you're struggling to process your emotions, you might be feeling alone even when talking to others, because you’re not able to authentically share what you're going through.
* **Difficulty with Vulnerability:**  It can be incredibly hard to be vulnerable – to share your true thoughts and feelings – and this can create a barrier to genuine connection.



**What You Can Do – Gentle Steps Forward**

Okay, let’s move beyond just understanding the “why” and start thinking about what you can do.  **Important Note:** You don't have to do *everything* at once. Start small and be kind to yourself.

1. **Acknowledge and Validate Your Feelings:**  The first step is simply to accept that you're feeling this way. Don’t try to push it away or tell yourself you *shouldn't* feel this way.  Saying to yourself, ""It's okay that I feel alone right now,"" can be surprisingly powerful.

2. **Start Small with Self-Care:**
   * **Gentle Activities:**  Engage in activities you enjoy, even if you don't feel like it.  This could be reading, listening to music, taking a bath, spending time in nature, or pursuing a hobby.
   * **Mindfulness & Relaxation:**  Try relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation.
   * **Get Enough Sleep & Eat Well:**  These basics can have a huge impact on your mood and energy levels.

3. **Gradual Re-engagement (When You're Ready):**
   * **One Small Connection:**  Instead of aiming for a big social event, try reaching out to *one* person you trust – a friend, family member, or even an online community.  Start with a simple message like, ""Hey, I'm having a bit of a tough time and just wanted to say hi.""
   * **Low-Pressure Interactions:**  Choose activities that don’t require a lot of social interaction at first, like going for a walk alone or joining a small group with a shared interest.

4. **Talk About It:**  If you feel comfortable, talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling.  Just voicing your emotions can be a huge relief. If you don’t have someone you feel comfortable talking to, consider:

184,My mother is combative with me when I say I don't want to talk with her about my depression.    She hasn't been supportive of me in the past and she isn't someone that I feel comfortable opening up to. She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I don't want to or can't answer. I tell her I don't want to talk and she starts arguments with me.    How can I get her to understand?,"Your situation sounds extremely frustrating.You're doing the right move to state you don't want to discuss your depression with her.I guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression.  If you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation, and you would like to tell her your true reason, then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time, not in the middle of an argument.Having an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept.  You may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it’s completely understandable that you’re struggling with it. Dealing with a combative parent, especially when it’s rooted in a history of lack of support and a discomfort with vulnerability, is incredibly draining. It’s great that you recognize this isn’t a healthy dynamic and you’re seeking ways to manage it. Here's a breakdown of how you can approach this, focusing on protecting your boundaries and your mental health:

**1. Understand Her Perspective (Without Taking Responsibility for It)**

* **She's Likely Driven by Concern (Even if it’s Misguided):**  Even if she’s not supportive, she likely *wants* to help. Her attempts to talk about your depression probably stem from a place of worry, a desire to fix things, or a misunderstanding of mental health.  Recognizing this doesn't excuse her behavior, but it can help you detach emotionally.
* **She Might Not Understand Depression:**  Historically, depression has been stigmatized. She may not understand what it feels like to experience it, leading to intrusive questions or attempts to ""cheer you up.""
* **Her Past Behavior:** You've correctly identified a pattern of lack of support. This is a huge factor. She's likely operating from a place of not knowing how to support you, and that can manifest as confrontation.

**2. Solidify Your Boundaries – and Stick to Them**

* **The Core Message: “I’m Not Ready to Talk.”** This is your primary statement. Repeat it consistently and calmly. There’s no need to justify it, explain it, or defend it. “Mom, I appreciate you wanting to talk, but I’m not ready to discuss my depression.”
* **Short, Firm Responses:**  When she persists, use brief, neutral responses:
    * ""I understand you're concerned, but I’ve said I don't want to talk about this.""
    * “I need to take care of myself right now.”
    * “Let’s talk about something else.” (And then immediately change the subject).
* **Don’t Engage in Arguments:** This is *crucial*. When she starts to argue, disengage.  Say, ""I'm not going to argue about this. I've made my position clear."" Then, walk away or end the conversation.
* **Grey Rock Method:** This technique involves becoming as uninteresting as possible to the person.  Provide minimal responses, avoid eye contact, and don't offer any emotional reaction. The goal is to make yourself a boring conversational partner, which can discourage her from pursuing the topic.

**3. Communication Strategies (Limited and Focused)**

* **Brief Acknowledgement (Optional):** You *can* briefly acknowledge her concern before reiterating your boundary. ""I know you’re worried, Mom, but I still don’t want to talk about this.""  This can sometimes satisfy her need to feel heard without opening the door to a deeper discussion.
* **Redirecting:** If she asks a triggering question, immediately redirect. “That’s a really personal question, Mom.  Let's talk about the weather/your garden/a shared memory.”
* **Focus on Shared Activities (If Possible):**  If you're spending time together, focus on neutral activities that don't require conversation about your mental health.


**4. Managing Your Own Emotional Response**

* **Recognize Her Behavior is About *Her*, Not You:** This is a key shift in perspective. Her combative behavior is a reflection of her own limitations, anxieties, and possibly past patterns. It’s not a judgment of your worth or your struggles.
* **Self-Care is Paramount:**  Dealing with this will be emotionally taxing. Prioritize activities that help you relax, de-stress, and feel grounded.
* **Seek Support Elsewhere:** Because this relationship is so challenging, it's vital to have other sources of support. This could be a therapist, a trusted friend, or a support group.

**5. Important Considerations**

* **You Can't Change Her:** You can control your boundaries and your reactions, but you can't force her to understand or accept them.
* **Acceptance (of the Relationship):** You may need to accept that this relationship will always be challenging. This doesn’t mean you have to tolerate abuse or disrespect, but it can help you manage your expectations.
* **Consider Limited Contact:** If the situation is consistently harmful, you may need to consider limiting contact with her.

969,I am a survivor of multiple sexual abuse/rape experiences. Triggers are having an effect on my daily life and my sexual relationship with my partner. I'm trying to learn to cope with them.,"I'm glad you're willing to keep optimistic about life improving and offering better relationships than some of the ones in which you greatly suffered.One suggestion is to develop patience with yourself and the process of regaining your willingness to trust other people.Sexual intimacy engages all of who we truly are.   Being cautious as to who and how much you allow someone into your life, is natural for anyone recovering from trauma.Allow yourself to withdraw when situations feel dangerous.   Your sense of danger is most likely on higher alert than had you not been victimized.Be attentive and cooperate with your own sense of readiness to engage in conversation, discussions and sex with your partner.Explain all this to your partner so the person can develop their own patience with your recuperation process.","Okay, thank you so much for sharing this with me. It takes immense courage to acknowledge the impact of trauma and to actively seek support. What you’re experiencing – the triggers, the disruption to your daily life, and the challenges in your sexual relationship – are incredibly common for survivors of sexual abuse and rape. It’s absolutely understandable that you’re struggling, and the fact that you’re trying to learn coping strategies is a really positive step.

Let's break this down and explore some ways to approach this.  I want to be very clear: **I am an AI and cannot provide therapy or replace the guidance of a qualified mental health professional.** My role here is to offer information, support, and suggestions, and to help you think through some strategies.  **Please prioritize finding a therapist who specializes in trauma and sexual abuse.**

**1. Understanding Triggers & Trauma Responses:**

* **What are Triggers?** Triggers are stimuli (sights, sounds, smells, conversations, thoughts, feelings, even physical sensations) that unexpectedly evoke memories and intense emotional responses related to the trauma. They’re not punishments; they’re a sign that the trauma is still impacting your nervous system.
* **Common Responses:**  When triggered, you might experience:
    * **Flashbacks:** Feeling like you’re reliving the event.
    * **Intrusive Thoughts:** Unwanted, distressing thoughts related to the abuse.
    * **Physical Reactions:** Increased heart rate, sweating, muscle tension, nausea, dizziness, hot flashes, etc. (These are often referred to as “fight, flight, or freeze” responses).
    * **Emotional Reactions:** Intense fear, shame, guilt, anger, sadness, hopelessness.
    * **Changes in Behavior:** Withdrawal, avoidance, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbances, changes in appetite.
* **Identifying Your Triggers:** This is a crucial first step. Keep a journal to track:
    * **What happened before the reaction?** (Be specific - what you saw, heard, felt, or thought).
    * **What was your physical reaction?** (Rate the intensity of your physical response on a scale of 1-10).
    * **What emotions did you experience?**
    * **How long did the reaction last?**

**2. Coping Strategies – Immediate Responses:**

* **Grounding Techniques:** These help bring you back to the present moment when you feel triggered:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:** Slow, deep breaths – inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 6 seconds.
    * **Sensory Focus:** Hold an ice cube, focus on the texture of a blanket, or listen to calming music.
* **Safe Space:** Have a designated “safe space” – a place where you feel secure and comfortable. This could be a room, a corner, or even an object.
* **Self-Soothing:**  Engage in activities that bring you comfort – taking a warm bath, cuddling with a pet, reading a book, listening to music.

**3.  Longer-Term Strategies & Relationship Impact:**

* **Therapy is Essential:**  Specifically, look for a therapist trained in:
    * **Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT):**  Helps you process the trauma and develop coping skills.
    * **Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR):**  A therapy technique that can help you reprocess traumatic memories.
    * **Sensorimotor Psychotherapy:**  Focuses on the body’s response to trauma.
* **Communication with Your Partner:** This is incredibly delicate.  Here’s how to approach it:
    * **Educate Your Partner:** Explain that you’ve experienced trauma and that triggers are a normal part of the healing process.  Help them understand what you need.
    * **Establish a Safety Plan:**  Discuss what your partner can do when you’re triggered – such as giving you space, offering a calming presence, or helping you with grounding techniques.
    * **Set Boundaries:**  It’s okay to say, “I’m not able to talk about this right now.”
    * **Regular Check-Ins:**  Continue to communicate openly about how you’re feeling and what you need.
* **Self-Care:** Prioritize your physical and emotional well-being. This includes:
    * **Healthy Diet:** Nourishing your body.
    * **Regular Exercise:**  Even gentle movement can be beneficial.
    * **Sufficient Sleep:**  Establish a consistent sleep schedule.
    * **Relaxation Techniques:**  Yoga, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation.

2025,How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"To be able to identify a clear ending to a counseling relationship, we must have a clear understanding of the goals and limitations of treatment.  Usually, during the initial evaluation, I identify my client’s short term and long term therapy goals.  As therapy progress, we verify goals on a monthly to a quarterly basis, depending on the frequency of the appointments.  Once the therapy goals have been met, there is a closing session, the counseling relationship is ended, and the client can stop attending sessions.  In some cases, the client can also establish new goals and determine if I am a good fit for their therapy needs or if they need a new provider, in which case I provide multiple referrals.The counseling relationship could also end due to other factors like noncompliance= when a client is not committed to the agreed treatment process, or when the client’s or a counselor violates the counseling relationship.  Either the counselor or the client is able to end counseling.  Although, as mental health providers we need to provide a reason for terminating our therapeutic relationship and referral options, as a client no explanation is needed, a closing session is highly recommended.  ¿Cómo termina la terapia?¿Cómo un consejero decide cuando terminar las sesiones de consejería o terminar de trabajar con un paciente?Para poder determinar el final de la relación del consejero, debemos comprender las metas y parámetros de la terapia.  Usualmente durante la evaluación inicial se identifican metas a corto y largo plazo con el cliente, y se discute con el cliente como esas metas serán alcanzadas.  Durante el proceso de terapia el consejero revisa las metas mensual o trimestralmente dependiendo de la frecuencia de las citas.  Ya que las metas de terapia son alcanzadas, hay una sesión de cierre y el cliente puede terminar la terapia.   En algunos casos el cliente puede identificar nuevas metas para la terapia y determinar si el mismo consejero u otro consejero le pueden asistir. 
La relación de consejería también puede terminar por no conformar o violentar los parámetros  establecidos para la terapia.   Tanto el consejero como el cliente pueden terminar la relación de terapia.  Como proveedores de salud mental los consejeros estamos obligados a proveer un razón para la conclusión del tratamiento y proveer referidos según aplique, los clientes no necesitan proveer una explicación, aunque es recomendable discutirlo en una sesión de cierre.","Terminating counseling sessions, or ending the therapeutic relationship, is a complex and often emotionally charged process. It’s not a simple ""done"" button, and counselors carefully consider a multitude of factors to ensure it's done ethically and in the client’s best interest. Here’s a breakdown of how a counselor decides when to terminate:

**1. Key Indicators & Signs of Readiness:**

* **Client Goal Achievement:** This is often the primary driver. If the client has achieved their initial goals, made significant progress, and feels confident in their ability to manage their challenges independently, termination is a natural step.
* **Client Self-Efficacy:** The counselor observes if the client demonstrates a belief in their own ability to cope, make decisions, and solve problems.  This is a crucial sign they are ready to move forward.
* **Reduced Dependence:** The counselor notices a decrease in the client’s reliance on the therapist for reassurance, validation, or problem-solving.
* **Increased Self-Awareness & Insight:** The client has developed a deeper understanding of their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and can articulate them effectively.
* **Client-Centered Motivation:** The client actively participates in the termination process, expresses a desire to continue on their own, and demonstrates a commitment to their well-being.

**2. Counselor Assessment & Observation:**

* **Therapeutic Alliance:** The counselor evaluates the strength of the therapeutic relationship. A strong alliance is vital for successful termination.
* **Client’s Readiness:** Beyond signs of goal achievement, the counselor assesses the client's emotional readiness.  Are they accepting of the need for termination? Are they experiencing significant anxiety or resistance?
* **Progress Towards Goals:**  The counselor reviews the client's progress against the established goals, noting both successes and areas where continued support might still be needed (though this doesn't automatically mean continued sessions).
* **Potential for Further Harm:** The counselor considers whether continued therapy could inadvertently reinforce unhealthy patterns or prevent the client from moving forward.

**3. Formal Termination Process - What a Counselor Will Do:**

* **Discussion & Planning:** The counselor initiates a conversation with the client about termination. This is a collaborative process. They will:
    * **Explain the rationale:** Clearly articulate why termination is being considered, focusing on the client's progress and readiness.
    * **Discuss expectations:**  Outline what to expect during the termination phase (e.g., fewer sessions, focus on closure).
    * **Address Concerns:**  Validate the client’s feelings of anxiety, sadness, or resistance.
* **Phased Termination (Often):**  Rather than abruptly ending sessions, many counselors use a phased approach:
    * **Reduced Frequency:** Sessions become shorter and less frequent.
    * **Focus on Review & Consolidation:** Sessions shift to reviewing progress, reinforcing coping skills, and solidifying strategies.
    * **Planning for the Future:**  The counselor helps the client develop a plan for continued support if needed (e.g., referrals to support groups, self-help resources).
* **Final Session:** This session is crucial for:
    * **Review & Reflection:**  A final opportunity to discuss the therapeutic experience.
    * **Expressing Gratitude:**  The counselor and client acknowledge the work done together.
    * **Providing Resources:**  Offering any relevant resources for continued support.
    * **Closing the Relationship:**  A final, respectful goodbye.

**4. Situations Where Termination Might Be Necessary (Even Without Readiness):**

* **Lack of Progress:** If the client has not made any progress after a reasonable amount of time.
* **Client Non-Compliance:** If the client is consistently missing appointments or not engaging in the therapeutic process.
* **Safety Concerns:** If the client poses a risk to themselves or others.
* **Impossibility of the Therapeutic Alliance:**  If a strong therapeutic alliance cannot be established or maintained.

**Important Note:**  Termination is *never* a decision made solely by the counselor. The client’s input and perspective are paramount.  A good counselor will always prioritize the client’s well-being and ensure a safe and respectful transition.

2867,I was born a girl. I look like a boy. I sometimes feel like a different variation of gender. I don't know what to say if someone asks my gender. I just get really confused and usually say my birth gender.,"I agree with Sherry, it is OK to give the answer that you feel most familiar with.  The most important part is not who people think you are, but that you know who you are.  Read about gender identity and fluidity.  Discovering the answer is a process, don't rush it to comply with others either way.  If you feel that this is a constant issue that keeps you awake and keeps you from enjoying your life, consider going to a therapist to discuss your feelings and concerns. ¿Qué significa que yo me sienta como diferentes géneros?Nací como niña. Me veo como niño.  A veces siento como una variación diferente de género.  No sé qué decirle a otros cuando pregunta que soy.  Me siento confuso y solo digo mi genero de nacimiento. Estoy de acuerdo con Sherry, está bien dar la respuesta que se sienta más cómoda.  La parte más importante no es quien las otras personas piensen que eres, sino quien tú piensas que eres.  Lee sobre el tema de identidad de género y fluidez de género.  Descubrir tu género puede ser un proceso, no lo apresures para complacer a otras personas.  Si sientes que este tema te esta quitando el sueno y te impide disfrutar tu vida, habla con tu consejero sobre tus sentimientos y preocupaciones.","Okay, let's talk about this. It sounds like you're going through a really complex and confusing experience, and it’s completely understandable that you're feeling lost and unsure of how to respond to questions about your gender. What you're describing – looking like a boy, feeling like a different gender, and struggling with how to answer – is actually a pretty common experience for transgender and gender-questioning individuals.

**First, let's validate your feelings.** It's *absolutely okay* to feel confused. It’s okay to not have a simple, easy answer to the question of “What are you?” Your feelings are valid, and you don’t need to force yourself to fit into a neat category.  It’s brave of you to acknowledge this confusion and to reach out for support.

**Let’s address the question of “What are you?”** You’ve already identified that you often say your birth gender, and that's a perfectly fine starting point. However, you're also right – it might not fully represent how you feel. Here are some ways you can respond, and you can choose the one that feels most comfortable and authentic to you *at the time*:

* **""I'm still figuring that out.""** This is a completely honest and valid response. It acknowledges your uncertainty without putting pressure on you to have a label.
* **“I identify as a woman.”** If that's how you feel most consistently, that’s perfectly okay.
* **“I’m non-binary.”** This term describes someone whose gender identity isn’t exclusively male or female. It's a broad term, and it might resonate with you.
* **“I don’t really use labels for my gender.”**  Some people simply don’t feel the need to define themselves with a specific gender term.
* **""My gender is complex and I'm still exploring it.""** This is a good way to open the door to further conversation if you want.
* **You can politely deflect:** ""That's a really interesting question, but I’m not really comfortable talking about my gender right now."" (This is a perfectly acceptable boundary.)

**Important things to remember:**

* **You don't owe anyone an explanation.** You are not obligated to explain your gender to anyone. It’s your personal information, and you control who you share it with and how.
* **It’s okay to change your answer.**  How you identify can shift over time, and that’s perfectly normal. You don’t need to stick with one answer forever.
* **It’s okay to be silent.** Sometimes, the best response is simply to not answer the question.
* **Focus on your feelings.**  Instead of worrying about labels, try to understand and accept your own feelings about gender.

1964,"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","Therapy is by nature a safe place to discuss difficult, or painful memories or experiences and thereby it is normal that feelings of all kinds, including sadness, loss, frustration, disappointment, etc may arise.  This is part of processing and bringing closure to things that may have been pushed aside for a lifetime and can now be faced and dealt with.  Change too is often not easy, and can lead to crying, whether from frustration and set back...or also from joy and accomplishment!","It's absolutely **normal** for people to cry during therapy! In fact, it's a really common and often incredibly valuable experience. It’s so common that you might feel like it’s just you, but it’s not. Here’s a breakdown of why it happens and why it's a good sign:

**Why People Cry in Therapy:**

* **Emotional Release:** Therapy creates a safe and supportive space where you can feel comfortable expressing vulnerable emotions. Suppressed feelings, grief, sadness, anger, shame, or even joy can bubble up and need to be released.
* **Deepening Connection:** Crying can actually strengthen the therapeutic relationship. It shows your therapist that you’re truly engaging with the material and letting go of defenses.
* **Trauma Response:** If you've experienced trauma, crying can be a natural response to re-experiencing those events, even in a controlled environment. Trauma can significantly impact emotional regulation.
* **Catharsis:** Crying can be a form of catharsis – a purging of intense emotions that can leave you feeling lighter and more at ease.
* **Trust and Vulnerability:** Allowing yourself to cry demonstrates a high level of trust in your therapist, which is crucial for the therapeutic process.
* **Processing Difficult Thoughts:** Sometimes, simply talking about a painful thought or memory can trigger an emotional response.

**Is it Just You?**

No! Research shows that crying is a frequent occurrence in therapy sessions. Studies have estimated that around 60-80% of people cry at least once during therapy.  It’s a sign that you're engaging deeply with the process.

**What Your Therapist Will Do:**

* **Validate Your Feelings:** A good therapist will acknowledge and validate your tears. They’ll say things like, ""It makes sense that you’re feeling this way,"" or “I can see how much this is affecting you.”
* **Explore the Feelings:** They’ll likely ask you about what’s triggering the tears and help you understand the underlying emotions.
* **Provide Support:** They’ll offer reassurance and support to help you process your feelings.
* **Normalize the Experience:** They'll likely let you know that crying is a normal and expected part of therapy.

**Important Note:** If you're experiencing frequent, overwhelming crying in therapy, or if it’s accompanied by other distressing symptoms (like panic attacks or suicidal thoughts), it's important to discuss this with your therapist. They can help you explore the reasons behind it and ensure you’re getting the support you need.

3076,I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.,"Sometimes we make ourselves feel worse with our own thoughts about things we can't change. We know that it is possible to overcome embarrassment and self-blame, but why does it seem so difficult to overcome it sometimes? If you tune into your own thoughts, or your ""internal dialogue"", you'll notice that your thoughts are connected to your feelings. So people who are holding onto embarrassment and self-blame often have thoughts like, ""How could I do that?"", ""I looked so stupid!"" ""Now people saw things I did not want them to see!"" If we tune in more, we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible, horrible, and that we cannot deal with it. These are self-sabotaging thoughts that lead to shame, self-blame and embarrassment. If you look at the evidence, you can find more rational thoughts such as, "" We all make mistakes"", ""People can look all different ways at different time - this incident does not define me!"" and ""If someone has a bad image or thought about me, it is really OK! People have all kinds of thoughts about other people, and it does not have to be a major problem."" When you practice your rational thoughts often and replace the negative ones, you will start to feel better, more confident and your embarrassment will decrease quickly.","Okay, that sounds like a really uncomfortable and upsetting situation. It's completely understandable that you felt embarrassed and self-conscious after that comment. Let's break down what happened and how you can process it.

**1. Validating Your Feelings:**

* **It was inappropriate:** The boy's comment was entirely inappropriate and disrespectful. It was a personal intrusion and focused on your appearance rather than your learning or skills. There's absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to feel comfortable and confident in your swimwear, and his comment was completely out of line.
* **Your feelings are valid:** You're allowed to feel embarrassed, upset, and even angry. Don't minimize your feelings or tell yourself you shouldn't be bothered. It's a natural reaction to feeling judged and uncomfortable.
* **It's not your fault:** You were doing your best to learn and participate, and his comment doesn't reflect on your abilities or your commitment to becoming a Water Safety Instructor.

**2. Understanding the Situation:**

* **Boys can be awkward:** Young boys, particularly, can sometimes struggle with social boundaries and understanding appropriate behavior. This doesn't excuse his actions, but it might help you understand that he may not have realized the impact of his words.
* **Focus on your learning:** Remember why you're there – to become a Water Safety Instructor.  Let this incident be a reminder to focus on your training and your goals.

**3. What You Can Do Now:**

* **Talk to someone you trust:** This is really important. Share what happened with a trusted adult – a parent, teacher, counselor, or another instructor. Talking about it can help you process your feelings and get support.
* **Don’t dwell on it:** While it's important to acknowledge your feelings, try not to let the incident consume you.  Focus on your training and your progress.
* **Consider a conversation (optional and carefully considered):**  You *could* consider talking to the boy directly, but this is entirely your choice and depends on how you feel. If you do, keep it simple and focused on the impact of his words: ""What you said made me feel uncomfortable, and it wasn't appropriate.""  Don't engage in an argument or try to make him feel bad.  If you don't feel comfortable doing this, that's perfectly okay.
* **Confidence in your skills:** Remind yourself of the valuable skills you're learning and the important role you'll play in water safety.

**4. Moving Forward:**

* **Set boundaries:** You have the right to feel comfortable in your learning environment. If you experience any further inappropriate behavior, speak up and report it to a trusted adult immediately.
* **Focus on your strengths:**  You've taken a significant step by becoming a Water Safety Instructor – that shows dedication and a commitment to helping others.

1844,I would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present.,"Remember, the past no longer exists and the future is just an illusion as we don't know what will happen tomorrow, so take the present as your guide. That is all we can do, so keep saying this to yourself and try to help someone each day.  The happiness is helping others to feel a bit better.","Okay, that's a fantastic goal! Wanting to have more positive relationships is a really worthwhile pursuit. It’s great that you’re recognizing this and actively seeking ways to improve. Let's break this down and explore some actionable steps you can take. 

Here's a layered approach, combining self-reflection, behavioral changes, and focusing on connection:

**1. Self-Reflection & Understanding:**

* **Identify Your Current Relationship Patterns:**  Let's start with some honest questions for you:
    * **What types of relationships do you *want*?** (e.g., deep friendships, supportive family, romantic connections, casual acquaintances)
    * **What types of relationships do you currently have?** (Be specific – e.g., ""I have a coworker I’d like to be closer to,"" or ""I feel distant from my siblings."")
    * **What's holding you back?** This is *crucial*.  Be brutally honest with yourself. Common reasons include:
        * **Fear of vulnerability:** Are you afraid of getting hurt, rejected, or judged?
        * **Low self-esteem:** Do you believe you’re worthy of positive relationships?
        * **Poor communication skills:** Do you struggle to express your needs and feelings clearly?
        * **Negative self-talk:** Do you frequently criticize yourself, which can impact how you present yourself to others?
        * **Past experiences:** Have past hurts influenced your current behavior?
        * **Lack of self-love:**  Do you prioritize other people's needs over your own?
* **Recognize Your Strengths:** What do you *already* bring to relationships? Are you a good listener, empathetic, funny, reliable, supportive? Focusing on your positive qualities can boost your confidence.
* **Journaling:**  Start a journal to explore these questions. Writing can help you gain clarity and identify recurring patterns.


**2. Behavioral Changes - What You Can Do *Now*:**

* **Start Small with Existing Relationships:** Don't try to overhaul everything at once. Choose *one* relationship you’d like to improve and focus your efforts there.
* **Initiate Contact:**  Don’t wait for others to reach out. Send a text, email, or make a call.  Simple things like “Thinking of you!” or “How’s your week going?” can make a difference.
* **Active Listening:** This is *huge*.  When someone is talking, truly listen.  Put away your phone, make eye contact, and focus on understanding their perspective.  Reflect back what you hear to confirm you understand: ""So, it sounds like you're feeling frustrated about...""
* **Ask Open-Ended Questions:**  Instead of questions with yes/no answers, ask questions that encourage people to elaborate.  ""What was the best part of your day?"" or “Tell me more about…”
* **Show Genuine Interest:**  Remember details about their lives – their hobbies, their family, their challenges.  This shows you care.
* **Offer Support (When Appropriate):**  Be there for people when they need it.  Sometimes just a listening ear is enough.
* **Express Gratitude:**  Let people know you appreciate them.  A simple “Thank you for being there for me” can go a long way.
* **Be Reliable:**  If you say you'll do something, do it.  Consistency builds trust.
* **Practice Forgiveness:**  Everyone makes mistakes.  Holding onto grudges will only damage relationships.

**3. Building New Connections:**

* **Join Groups & Activities:**  This is a fantastic way to meet people with shared interests. Think about your hobbies – book clubs, sports teams, volunteer organizations, art classes, etc.
* **Say ""Yes"" More Often:**  Be open to invitations, even if they're outside your comfort zone.
* **Be Approachable:**  Smile, make eye contact, and have open body language.
* **Start Conversations:**  Don’t be afraid to initiate conversations with people you encounter – at the gym, coffee shop, or even waiting in line. Start with a simple observation or question. “That’s a cool backpack!” or “Do you know if this place is usually this busy?”
* **Reconnect with Old Friends:** Reach out to people you’ve lost touch with.

**4.  Important Mindset Shifts:**

* **Focus on Giving, Not Just Getting:**  Positive relationships are built on mutual support and generosity.
* **Be Patient:**  Building strong relationships takes time and effort. Don’t get discouraged if things don't happen overnight.
* **Accept Imperfection:**  No relationship is perfect.  There will be disagreements and challenges.  Learn to navigate them constructively.
* **Self-Care:** Taking care of your own mental and emotional well-being will make you a better friend, partner, and family member.

1159,"The eight months I've been dating my boyfriend, I have lied about a lot of things. I slept with a couple guys to get back at my boyfriend for breaking up with me. Now anything I say to him he won't believe, even if I'm being honest. I don't know what else to do at this point. He constantly criticizes me.","Start a conversation with him about your sincere interest to earn back his trust.Ask him what he expects from you so that he will trust you again.If you are consciously willing and do try to earn back his trust, and have periodic conversations with him on whether he feels more at ease with trusting you, then after a few months of this, both of you should feel more secure in the relationship.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it’s incredibly brave of you to reach out and acknowledge what's happening. You’re right to recognize the damage you’ve done with your lies, and the current state of your relationship is a direct consequence of that. Let's break this down and figure out some steps you can take.

**1. Understanding the Depth of the Problem:**

* **The Lies as a Foundation:** What you’ve described – the infidelity and the subsequent lies – has fundamentally eroded trust. Trust is the bedrock of any healthy relationship. Without it, communication breaks down, and your boyfriend's criticisms likely stem from hurt, anger, and a sense of betrayal.
* **The Cycle:** You've created a vicious cycle. You lied to get back at him, which fueled his criticism, which then made it even harder for you to be honest, leading to more lies.
* **Your Motivation:** It's important to acknowledge *why* you did what you did. You were hurting, and acting out of anger and a desire for revenge. While understandable, it doesn’t excuse the actions or the damage they’ve caused.

**2. Addressing the Current Situation:**

* **Stop the Lies – Immediately:** This is the absolute priority. Continuing to lie will only deepen the problem and destroy any chance of rebuilding trust. Recognize that you’re struggling with this, and that’s okay – but you need to commit to honesty, even when it's incredibly difficult.
* **Acknowledge the Hurt (To Him):** You need to have a conversation with your boyfriend, but it needs to be carefully approached. Don't start by defending yourself or minimizing your actions. Instead, acknowledge the pain you've caused. Something like, ""I want to sincerely apologize for the pain I've caused you. I understand that my actions were wrong, and I take full responsibility for the hurt I've inflicted. I know I've broken your trust, and I'm so sorry.""  *Don't* bring up the other men or the reasons for your actions. Focus solely on the damage you’ve done.
* **Listen to His Response:** He's going to be angry, hurt, and likely skeptical. Let him express his feelings. Validate his feelings by saying things like, “I understand why you’re feeling this way,” or “I can see how betrayed you feel.”
* **Be Prepared for Him to End the Relationship:** Despite your apology, he may not be able to forgive you. He has every right to end the relationship due to the level of betrayal. You need to be prepared for this possibility.

**3. Taking Care of Yourself:**

* **Therapy is Crucial:** Seriously, this is a situation that requires professional help. A therapist can help you understand the underlying reasons for your behavior, process the guilt and shame, and develop healthier coping mechanisms. They can also help you navigate the difficult conversation with your boyfriend.
* **Self-Reflection:** Spend time understanding *why* you sought revenge. What were you feeling? What needs weren't being met? This isn’t about excusing your actions, but about gaining insight.
* **Focus on Self-Compassion:** You're dealing with a lot of guilt and shame. Be kind to yourself. Recognize that you made mistakes, but you can learn from them.

**4. Important Considerations:**

* **He May Not Believe You:** Given the extent of the lies, he may struggle to believe anything you say, even if it's the truth. This is a painful reality, and you need to accept that.
* **Forgiveness Takes Time (If It's Possible):** If he *is* willing to consider forgiveness, it will take a very long time – potentially years. It’s not something you can force.
* **You Can’t Control His Reaction:** Ultimately, you can only control your own actions and words. You can't control how he responds.

1641,"My fiancé doesn't think I trust him because I was cheated on before. However, he hides his phone and has been texting his ex-girlfriend, who he has two kids with. What should I do?","Oh Chino, I only have half the picture here so I will be cautious. There's a chicken and an egg, and I don't know which came first. One thing I see clearly is that your fiance will always have to have communications with his ex, because they have children. Can you accept that? When suspicion and insecurity come along, your job is to look at the big picture and the real picture. Is there any real evidence that he is cheating? Remember that texting his ex is not evidence alone if the communications are about the kids. Has he earned your trust? If so, then it's not fair to punish him for the betrayals of others. He's not your ex. Reassure your heart that you are his priority if the larger evidence supports that. At the same time, you can let him know what your triggers are. For example, hiding his phone doesn't send you a good message, right? See, this is the chicken and the egg...is he hiding the phone because you've been overreacting when he gets a text?  So let him know you won't blow up about him getting a text if he doesn't conceal or password his phone. Transparency helps build trust. You have sensitivities, and it helps you a lot if he's aware of them and willing to try not to do things that trigger fear. Let him know when you get scared, and hopefully he'll give you the openness and security you need in order to trust him and act as if you trust him.  :)","Okay, this is a *really* tough situation, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling confused, hurt, and deeply insecure. What you're describing – a past betrayal, coupled with current secrecy and contact with an ex, creates a perfect storm of distrust. Let's break down what you should do, focusing on your well-being and building a path forward.

**1. Prioritize Your Emotional Safety:**

* **Recognize Your Feelings:** You're entitled to feel however you're feeling – anger, sadness, fear, betrayal, confusion. Don’t minimize or dismiss these emotions. They are valid responses to what’s happening.
* **Separate Your Feelings from His Actions:** While his actions are incredibly hurtful, try not to internalize the past betrayal as a judgment of him *now*.  He is responsible for his choices, but you are not responsible for his insecurities or his past.
* **Seek Support:** Talk to a therapist, trusted friend, or family member. Having someone to process your feelings with is crucial.  A therapist can provide tools to manage your anxiety and build healthy coping mechanisms.

**2. Addressing the Immediate Issues – The Secrecy and Contact with the Ex:**

* **Clear Communication (When You're Ready):** You need to have a very direct and firm conversation with him. However, *don't* initiate this conversation when you're in the heat of the moment. Choose a time when you can both be relatively calm. Here’s how you could start:
    * ""I need to talk about your phone and your contact with [Ex's Name].  It’s creating a massive amount of anxiety and distrust for me.  I need you to understand that this is unacceptable.""
    * “I understand you may have reasons for wanting to keep your phone private, but the continued texting with [Ex’s Name] is deeply concerning. It feels like you don’t trust me, and it's making me question everything.”
* **Demand Transparency:** You have a right to transparency in a relationship.  Specifically, you need:
    * **Open Phone Access:** While you can't demand a warrant, you can agree to a level of openness. This might involve him showing you his phone when you're together, or agreeing to share certain conversations if you feel uneasy.  Frame this as a way to build trust, not as an invasion of privacy.
    * **Honest Communication about Contact with the Ex:** He needs to be completely honest about *why* he’s texting his ex. Is it purely logistical (arranging childcare)? Is there anything more going on?  Red flags here include flirtatious texts, emotional vulnerability, or scheduling time together.
* **Establish Boundaries:** Clearly define what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior. ""Continued texting with [Ex's Name] is not okay. If you need to communicate about the kids, let’s do it through [agreed-upon method – e.g., text, phone call, email].""

**3. Addressing His Belief That You Don't Trust Him:**

* **Explain Your Perspective:**  ""I’m struggling to trust you *right now* because of the secrecy and your continued contact with [Ex’s Name]. It’s not about automatically assuming you’re cheating; it’s about the *actions* you’re taking that are making it incredibly difficult for me to feel secure.""
* **Focus on Building Trust:** Trust is earned, not given. He needs to demonstrate that he’s committed to rebuilding your trust through consistent, honest behavior.
* **Consider Couples Counseling:** A therapist can help you both communicate more effectively, address underlying issues, and develop strategies for building a stronger, more trusting relationship.

**4. Important Considerations & Red Flags:**

* **His Response Matters:** Pay very close attention to *how* he responds to your concerns. Is he defensive, dismissive, or genuinely willing to understand your perspective and make changes?
* **Gaslighting:** Be aware of gaslighting – where he tries to make you doubt your own perceptions or feelings. If he’s doing this, it's a major red flag.
* **Past Behavior is Predictive:** His past actions are relevant.  If he’s demonstrated a pattern of secrecy or boundary violations, it’s a significant concern.

1807,I just wanted to get to know one so I can hear about their college experience and the courses they took. I also wanted to know if they enjoy their job and how long they were in school.,"It's a great idea for you to reach out to find a psychologist to talk to if this is a field you might be interested in pursuing. Regarding the length of schooling, it generally takes 4 years of college and an additional 4 to 7 years of graduate school to earn a doctorate degree to become a psychologist. There are also other similar professions, including counseling that don't require a doctorate degree. Licensed counselors generally completed 4 years of college and an additional 2 years of graduate school. If you are thinking about a career in psychology, the local APA chapter would be a good place to start to find a local psychologist to talk to. Here's a link to the NJ APA chapter:https://www.psychologynj.org/","Okay, I can definitely help you with that! To do this effectively, I need you to tell me a little bit about who you'd like to talk to. 

**Please tell me:**

* **Who are you interested in talking to?** (You can describe them - a friend, a family member, someone you met online, etc. - and give me some basic information about them, like their major or what they do for a living.) 

Once you give me that information, I can start crafting some questions to ask them about their college experience and job. 

**Here are some example questions I could use, depending on the person you're talking to:**

*   **About College:**
    *   ""What college did you attend?""
    *   ""What did you study?""
    *   ""What was your favorite course and why?""
    *   “Can you describe a challenging course you took and how you overcame it?”
    *   “What was the best part of your college experience?”
    *   “How long were you in school?”
    *   “Did you participate in any clubs or organizations?”

*   **About Their Job:**
    *   ""What do you do for a living now?""
    *   ""What do you enjoy most about your job?""
    *   ""What are some of the challenges you face in your job?""
    *   “How did your college experience prepare you for your current role?”

1221,We've been dating for two months now. I have a heavy past that gets him angry. Does he have a right to penalize me for things I did before I met him?,"Not in my book. You're only two months in? At this early stage, this is a bit of a warning sign. If he can't accept or feel comfortable with who you are and decisions you've made, there's already a level of discomfort here that shouldn't be ignored. No, he doesn't have the right to penalize you or punish you ...not just for past things...not for anything. What he does get to do it tell you how it affects him. Sure...if he feels uncomfortable or needs reassurance...listen to those things. But If he doesn't dig who you are, maybe he can walk the other way.","Okay, this is a really important and complex issue, and it's great that you're recognizing it and asking for guidance. Let's break this down. The short answer is **no, he doesn't have a right to penalize you for your past.** However, the situation is nuanced, and your feelings and his behavior are both valid to explore.

Here’s a detailed look at why he doesn't have the right, and what's actually happening, along with how to approach it:

**1. Why He Doesn't Have the Right:**

* **You are not him:** His past experiences and reactions are *his* to process. He can't take your past actions and use them to control or punish you in your current relationship.  You've built a new relationship, and that deserves to be built on trust and respect, not based on something you did before you were together.
* **Holding onto the past is unhealthy:**  Dwelling on past mistakes and using them to create conflict is a sign of unresolved issues. It's a pattern of behavior, and it's not fair to be held accountable for something that happened outside of your current dynamic.
* **Relationship should be about the *now*:** A healthy relationship is built on mutual understanding, acceptance, and moving forward together.  Using the past as a weapon undermines this.
* **He’s likely projecting:** Often, when someone reacts strongly to something from a past relationship (or even a past experience), they're not really reacting to *you* specifically. They're reacting to their own unresolved feelings, insecurities, or fears about commitment.


**2. What's Likely Happening (Understanding His Behavior):**

* **Unresolved Trauma/Past Relationship Issues:**  It’s highly probable he’s carrying unresolved pain from a previous relationship, or perhaps even a past experience that has made him wary of vulnerability and intimacy.
* **Fear of Repeating the Past:** He might be genuinely afraid of repeating negative patterns he's seen in the past. This is understandable to a degree, but the way he’s expressing it is the problem.
* **Control/Power Dynamic:** Sometimes, using anger and punishment is a way to exert control in a relationship. This is a serious red flag.
* **He might not even be aware:** He could be completely unconscious of how his reactions are impacting you and the relationship.

**3. How to Address This (What *You* Can Do):**

* **Communicate Clearly and Calmly:**  This is crucial. Choose a time when you're both relaxed and can talk openly.  Use ""I feel"" statements to express your experience: ""I feel hurt and invalidated when you get angry with me about things that happened before we were together. It makes me feel like I’m being punished for something I can't change.""
* **Set Boundaries:**  ""I understand you might have concerns about certain patterns, but I won't tolerate being made to feel guilty or punished for my past.  I'm committed to building a healthy relationship with you, and that starts with respect.""
* **Don't Engage in the Punishment:** When he starts to use anger as a weapon, *don’t* get drawn into an argument.  Say something like, “I hear you’re upset, but I’m not going to discuss this when you’re expressing anger. Let’s talk about this when we’re both calm.” Then, disengage.
* **Encourage Him to Talk About *His* Feelings:**  Gently encourage him to talk about what's bothering him, but don't take responsibility for fixing his feelings.  ""I want to understand what's driving your reaction. Can you help me understand what you're feeling?""
* **Suggest Professional Help:** If this is a recurring pattern and he’s struggling to manage his emotions, suggest couples therapy or individual therapy for him. This isn’t about blaming him; it’s about him getting the support he needs to process his past.

**4. Red Flags to Watch For:**

* **Constant Criticism & Guilt-Tripping:** If he consistently brings up your past to make you feel bad.
* **Using Anger as a Control Mechanism:** If he uses anger to manipulate you or make you do things you don’t want to do.
* **Refusal to Take Responsibility for His Own Reactions:** If he refuses to acknowledge how *he* is contributing to the conflict.
* **Threats or Ultimatums:**  “If you keep doing this, I’m…”

3063,"My roommate has had a drinking problem for a while. She goes out, gets trashed, and then expects everyone to take care of her. The next morning, she apologizes constantly until she feels validated. She also thinks everyone hates her all the time. If I don't seem anything other than happy, she asks me ""Do you hate me? You hate me. Tell me you love me,"" and I feel like I have to pity her because she has also been suicidal before.","It does sound like your roommate may have a drinking problem, and the short answer is that you can't do anything about it, only she can. We can't change what other people say, think, or do. We can only change our reactions. It does sound like your roommate may be having a hard time. You can suggest that she enter counseling or therapy. You can reassure her that you like her (if that's true), but you don't have to pity her.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it’s incredibly understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed and drained. You’re dealing with a complex mix of your roommate's drinking problem, her intense emotional needs, and her past suicidal thoughts – all while trying to maintain your own well-being. Let's break down what's happening and what you can do.

**Understanding What's Going On**

* **Her Drinking & Dependency:** Her behavior is clearly linked to her drinking. Alcohol lowers inhibitions and can exacerbate existing insecurities and anxieties. The expectation of others taking care of her after she’s been drinking is a pattern of behavior that likely developed over time.
* **Emotional Vulnerability & Need for Validation:** Her constant apologies and pleas for love stem from deep insecurity and a belief that she’s disliked. This could be rooted in past experiences, low self-esteem, or the effects of alcohol on her thinking.
* **Suicidal Thoughts:** The fact that she’s had suicidal thoughts is a serious indicator of the depth of her distress. It highlights the importance of taking her concerns seriously and seeking support for both of you.
* **Your Response:** You're understandably struggling to meet her constant demands and her perception of negativity.  It’s natural to feel drained when someone consistently needs reassurance and validation, especially when it feels like a burden.

**What You Can Do – Prioritizing Your Well-being**

1. **Set Boundaries – This is Crucial:** You absolutely have the right to protect your own mental and emotional health. You cannot ""fix"" her, and trying to constantly reassure her will only exhaust you. Here's how to set boundaries:
   * **Limit Availability:** You don’t need to be constantly available to her.  It's okay to say, ""I'm not available to talk right now,"" or ""I need some time to myself.""
   * **Don’t Engage in the “Do You Hate Me?” Cycle:** This is incredibly important. When she asks, “Do you hate me? Tell me you love me,” you can respond with something neutral like:
      * ""I care about you, but I can’t respond to those questions.""
      * “I’m not comfortable discussing my feelings about you in that way.”
      * “I’m here to listen if you want to talk about something else.”
   * **Don't Take Responsibility for Her Feelings:** You are *not* responsible for her feelings or her reactions.

2. **Support Her Seeking Help (Without Enabling):**
   * **Encourage Professional Help:** Gently suggest she talk to a therapist or counselor. You could say, “I’m concerned about you and I think talking to a professional could really help you feel better.”  Offer to help her find resources.
   * **Offer Resources:** Have information readily available – local therapists, support groups (like Al-Anon for families of alcoholics), crisis hotlines.
   * **Don’t Enable Her Drinking:** This is incredibly important. Don’t buy her alcohol, cover for her, or make excuses for her behavior.

3. **Communicate Clearly and Kindly (But Firmly):**
   * **""I"" Statements:** Express your feelings and needs without blaming her.  For example, ""I feel overwhelmed when I’m constantly asked if I hate you. I need some space to take care of myself.""
   * **Acknowledge Her Pain (Briefly):** You can validate her feelings without taking responsibility. “I hear that you're feeling really down, and I want you to know I'm here for you *as a friend*.”

4. **Take Care of Yourself:**
   * **Prioritize Your Mental Health:** Engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.
   * **Seek Support for Yourself:** Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist about what you’re going through.  You don't have to carry this alone.

3499,"After first meeting the client, what is the process that a counselor facilitates?","Hi.  This is an excellent question !   I think that the answer probably varies depending upon the particular therapist .  In my work with people , once we have met and I have gotten an idea of the person'a concerns and the issues they want help with , I spend the next few sessions gathering as much history and as much information about the client's current concerns in order to formulate some ideas about what may be causing distress .  I would then share my thoughts with the client to see if they feel I am understanding them and on the right track.  We would then discuss the best plan to address the client's concerns .  Usually I will suggest strategies that I think may be helpful and ask the client for feedback about whether or not they think my suggestions feel helpful .   I always encourage clients to be really honest with me about this.  I tell them that I would hate for them to agree to try things that they know they won't try just to avoid ""hurting my feelings"" or ""offending me.""  I want to be helpful and while I have the expertise as far as typically helpful  strategies, I really like to work collaboratively and have clients tell me what they do and don't like / agree with or not agree with when I share my thoughts about a treatment plan .  We the   work together to come up with a plan that will be helpful , but also realistic and then revise it and try new things if necessary as we go along.   If things aren't improving , I am very happy and willing to try something new ! I hope this is helpful for you ! ","Okay, let's break down the process a counselor typically facilitates after a first meeting with a client. It's rarely a linear, step-by-step process, but here's a common and effective framework, often referred to as the **stages of therapy**:

**1. Initial Assessment & Rapport Building (Immediately Following the First Meeting - 1-3 Sessions)**

* **Review & Clarification:** The counselor will often start by reviewing what was discussed in the initial meeting. They'll clarify any misunderstandings and ensure the client feels heard and understood.
* **Gathering Information:** This is a crucial phase. The counselor will delve deeper into the client’s:
    * **Presenting Problem:**  What brought them in? What are their current struggles?  They’ll explore the specific issues causing distress.
    * **History:** This includes family history, past relationships, significant life events, trauma (if any), and any previous mental health experiences (therapy, medication).  It’s not about dwelling on the past, but understanding how it may be influencing the present.
    * **Symptoms:**  Exploring the nature and intensity of their symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, intrusive thoughts, difficulty sleeping).
    * **Strengths & Resources:**  Identifying the client's existing strengths, coping mechanisms, support systems, and resources they can draw upon.
* **Establishing Rapport:** Building a strong therapeutic relationship is paramount. This involves:
    * **Empathy & Validation:**  The counselor demonstrates understanding and validates the client’s feelings.
    * **Collaboration:**  The counselor and client work together as a team.
    * **Trust:**  Creating a safe and confidential space where the client feels comfortable being vulnerable.
* **Setting Goals:**  Beginning to collaboratively identify what the client wants to achieve through therapy. These goals should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).



**2. Exploration & Understanding (Sessions 3-8, and Ongoing)**

* **Deepening Exploration:**  The counselor helps the client explore the *why* behind their problems. This might involve:
    * **Exploring Underlying Themes:** Identifying recurring patterns of thinking, feeling, and behavior.
    * **Examining Core Beliefs:**  Looking at deeply held beliefs about themselves, others, and the world – often these are unconscious and contribute significantly to distress.
    * **Exploring Relationships:** Examining how relationships impact the client’s well-being.
* **Psychoeducation:** Providing the client with information about their condition (if applicable), mental health concepts, and coping strategies.
* **Developing Coping Skills:**  Introducing and practicing techniques like:
    * **Cognitive Restructuring:**  Challenging and changing negative thought patterns.
    * **Relaxation Techniques:**  Deep breathing, mindfulness, progressive muscle relaxation.
    * **Problem-Solving Skills:**  Helping the client develop strategies for tackling challenges.



**3. Intervention & Change (Sessions 8+, and Ongoing)**

* **Applying Techniques:**  The counselor helps the client actively use the skills and strategies they’ve learned.
* **Behavioral Experiments:**  Testing out new behaviors or approaches in real-life situations.
* **Addressing Resistance:**  Exploring and addressing any resistance to change.
* **Focusing on the Future:**  As the client progresses, the focus shifts towards building a more fulfilling future.



**4. Termination (When Goals Are Met or When the Client Chooses to End Therapy)**

* **Review of Progress:**  The counselor and client collaboratively review the client’s progress and accomplishments.
* **Developing a Plan for Maintaining Progress:**  Creating a plan for continuing to use coping skills and seeking support if needed.
* **Final Session:**  A final session to address any lingering concerns and formally end the therapeutic relationship.

**Important Notes:**

* **Flexibility:** This is a general framework. The specific process will be tailored to the client’s individual needs, goals, and the counselor’s theoretical orientation (e.g., CBT, psychodynamic, humanistic).
* **Client-Centered:** The client is always at the center of the process. The counselor’s role is to facilitate, guide, and support the client’s journey.
* **Ongoing Assessment:** The counselor continuously assesses the client’s progress and adjusts the treatment plan as needed.

2740,I feel really uncomfortable when I have people's attention.  It makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class. Can I get over this social anxiety?,"Since anxiety usually about anticipating a bad result, or fear of being judged negatively, as though having failed some sort of test, consider what would give you the feeling of anticipating a good result from talking to an audience?Maybe, for example, if you prepared and rehearsed your talk more than what you typically would, you'd feel more secure in speaking  in front of an audience.Once you sort through your particular reason as to the source of your discomfort, it may feel more manageable.Yes, social anxiety can change.  You may naturally prefer smaller groups than an audience.And, it is possible to decrease anxiety in what may always be somewhat uncomfortable for you.","Okay, it's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge this and reach out for help. Feeling uncomfortable with people's attention and experiencing social anxiety is a really common struggle, and you're definitely not alone. It's fantastic that you're recognizing it and wanting to make a change – that's the first, and often hardest, step. Let’s break this down and explore what you can do.

**1. Understanding Your Social Anxiety:**

* **What Triggers It?** Let's start with specifics. What *exactly* makes you uncomfortable? Is it:
    * **Fear of Judgment:** Are you worried about what others think of you?
    * **Fear of Embarrassment:** Are you afraid of saying something wrong or doing something awkward?
    * **Physical Symptoms:** Do you experience physical symptoms like a racing heart, sweating, blushing, or dizziness when you're in social situations?
    * **Specific Situations:** Is it more intense in certain environments (e.g., large groups, classrooms, talking to strangers)?
    * **Past Experiences:**  Could there be a past experience that's contributing to this feeling?
* **Recognize it’s a Response:**  Understand that this isn't necessarily a reflection of *you* as a person. It's a natural, albeit intense, response to a perceived threat.  It's your brain trying to protect you.

**2. Strategies to Manage Your Anxiety:**

* **Start Small:** Don’t try to suddenly become a social butterfly.  That's overwhelming.  Start with incredibly small, manageable steps:
    * **Brief Interactions:** Practice saying ""hello"" to a cashier, a neighbor, or someone you encounter briefly.
    * **One Question:** In class, focus on listening and understanding, and if you feel comfortable, ask *one* simple question.
    * **Eye Contact:**  Practice making brief eye contact with people – you don’t have to hold it for long.
* **Gradual Exposure:**  This is key.  Work your way up to slightly more challenging situations.  For example:
    * Week 1: Saying ""hello"" to one person.
    * Week 2: Asking a simple question in class.
    * Week 3:  Making small talk with a classmate after class.
* **Grounding Techniques:** When you feel the anxiety rising, use grounding techniques to bring yourself back to the present moment. These can be incredibly helpful:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Name 5 things you can *see*, 4 things you can *touch*, 3 things you can *hear*, 2 things you can *smell*, and 1 thing you can *taste*.
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system. Try inhaling for 4 seconds and exhaling for 6 seconds.
* **Challenge Negative Thoughts:** Social anxiety often involves negative thoughts like, “Everyone is judging me,” or “I’m going to mess up.”  Start to question these thoughts.  Are they based on facts, or are they assumptions?  Replace them with more realistic and positive ones, like, “Some people might not notice me,” or “It’s okay to make mistakes.”

**3. Longer-Term Strategies & Seeking Support:**

* **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** CBT is a very effective therapy for social anxiety. It helps you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.
* **Exposure Therapy:**  A type of CBT that involves gradually exposing yourself to feared situations.
* **Relaxation Techniques:**  Regular practice of relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation can help reduce overall anxiety levels.
* **Talk to Someone You Trust:**  Sharing your feelings with a friend, family member, or trusted mentor can provide support and validation.
* **Professional Help:**  Consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide personalized guidance and support.  Here are some resources:

**Important Reminders:**

* **Be Kind to Yourself:**  Social anxiety is a process, not a destination. There will be good days and bad days. Don’t beat yourself up if you have a setback.
* **Celebrate Small Wins:** Acknowledge and celebrate every step you take, no matter how small.
* **It’s Okay to Say No:**  You don't have to force yourself into situations that feel overwhelming.  It's perfectly okay to decline invitations or activities when you need to.

**To help me give you even more tailored advice, could you tell me a little more about:**

2633,"I've been with him for a couple months. We will talk everyday and he will get mad over something I will say and not talk to me. We have our great moments, but I just need to focus on my personal situations, and I feel he is slowing me down with that. I still wanna be with him, but not now.","I have learned that the best approach is to say that you need the time to get yourself together, mature, learn, outside of a intimate relationship but just in a friend to friend relationship...don't blame him or point fingers at him.... most likely if you did that it would not go well.  If you make it about you and that you want the best for him while you work on self, it would be taken better.  ","Okay, this sounds like a really tough situation, and it's great that you're recognizing what you need and communicating it – even if it's just to yourself for now. It’s completely valid to feel this way, and you're smart to assess the dynamic and prioritize your own well-being. Let’s break this down and talk about how you can approach this.

**Here's a breakdown of what you’re experiencing and some ways to handle it:**

* **The Pattern is Concerning:** You’ve identified a pattern of him getting upset over small things and then withdrawing communication. This isn’t healthy in a relationship, and it’s a clear sign that something isn't quite right.  Frequent mood swings and inconsistent communication can be incredibly draining and confusing.
* **Your Needs Are Valid:** You said you need to focus on your personal situations, and that's perfectly okay. Relationships are about supporting each other’s growth and priorities. It’s not selfish to need space and time for yourself.
* **You Want to Continue, But on Different Terms:** This is a crucial point. You still have feelings for him, but you recognize a mismatch in your current needs. This is a good starting point – you're not necessarily ending things completely, just taking a step back.

**Here’s what you can do, broken down into steps:**

1. **Communicate (Carefully):** You absolutely *should* talk to him, but do it strategically. Don't launch into a blame-filled conversation.  Here’s a possible approach:

   * **Start with a positive:** ""I really value the connection we have and I enjoy spending time with you. I've been thinking a lot about us lately.""
   * **Express your needs gently:** ""I've realized that I need to prioritize some personal things right now – [briefly mention what those things are, without over-sharing]. It's important for my own well-being.""
   * **Explain the impact:** ""When things get a little tense and communication breaks down, it makes it difficult for me to focus on that. I need a little more space to recharge and pursue my own interests.""
   * **Set a boundary:** ""I need to take a step back for a while to really focus on myself, and I'm not sure how much time we should spend together right now. Let's see how things go, but I need to put my own needs first.""

   **Important Note:**  Prepare for him to react defensively. He might get angry or try to argue. Stay calm, reiterate your needs, and don’t get drawn into a circular argument.

2. **Implement Boundaries:** This is the most important part.  You’ve said you need space, so *take it*. This means:

   * **Reduce Contact:**  You've already identified this, which is excellent. Stick to your reduced contact plan.
   * **Don't Engage When He's Upset:** If he starts getting angry or critical, politely disengage. Say something like, “I’m not comfortable with this conversation right now. Let’s talk when we’re both calmer.”
   * **Don't Chase:** Resist the urge to reach out just because you miss him or want to fix things. This will likely just reinforce the pattern.

3. **Focus on Yourself:** This is key to your well-being.  Invest your energy in the things you need to do – your personal situations, hobbies, friends, etc.

4. **Re-evaluate Later:**  Give this time and space to work. After a set period (a few weeks, a month – whatever feels right for you), you can revisit the situation.  Ask yourself:

   * Has his behavior changed?
   * Are your needs being met?
   * Do you still feel a strong connection?

**Important Considerations:**

* **He May Not Understand:** Be prepared for him to not understand or accept your needs. This doesn’t mean you’re doing anything wrong. It just means you have different priorities and needs.
* **Protect Yourself:**  If his behavior escalates, becomes manipulative, or makes you feel unsafe, prioritize your safety and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist.

**To help me give you even more tailored advice, could you tell me a little more about:**

*   **What exactly does he get mad about?** (Without going into excessive detail, can you give me a general idea of the types of things he reacts to?)
*   **How long have you been together?**
*   **What are some of the ""great moments"" you mentioned?** (This helps me understand the positive aspects of the relationship)",0.5110843777656555
410,"When I get talked to by my dad or stepmom, or if I'm in trouble, I will begin to cry and not say what's wrong with me. When my dad or stepmom ask what is wrong, I never know the answers or the words to put together what is actually wrong with me.","Maybe you need more time to reflect and organize your thoughts.Try to figure out what would make you feel more relaxed about talking to your dad or stepmom.Also its possible you simply don't feel safe around either of them and so intuitively realize you're better off not talking with them about a delicate matter.Depending on whether you trust talking to dad and stepmom, you may simply wish to excuse yourself from speaking about yourself.There's no good reason to be heartfelt with people whom you don't feel are willing to accept or understand who you are.","Okay, this sounds incredibly frustrating and difficult, and it's really brave of you to talk about it. What you're describing is a very common experience, and it's important to acknowledge that it's not your fault. There are several reasons why this might be happening, and it's a complex issue that often stems from a combination of factors. Let's break it down and explore some possibilities:

**1. The Emotional Response - Crying and Shutting Down:**

* **Fight, Flight, Freeze:** When you feel threatened, scared, or overwhelmed, your body’s natural response is often “fight, flight, or freeze.” Crying is a very common physical manifestation of this. It's a release of stress hormones and can be a way to try to diffuse a tense situation. You're not *trying* to avoid saying what’s wrong; your body is reacting instinctively.
* **Overwhelm:**  The feeling of being in trouble or being confronted by a parent can be incredibly overwhelming, especially if you don't have the coping skills to manage those feelings. Crying can be a way to temporarily shut down and protect yourself from feeling completely consumed by the emotion.
* **Lack of Verbal Processing Skills:**  Younger children, and even some teenagers, haven't fully developed the ability to articulate complex emotions and experiences into words. It’s a skill that needs to be learned and practiced.

**2. The Difficulty Finding the Words:**

* **Intense Emotions:** When you’re feeling intensely – fear, shame, anger, sadness – it's incredibly hard to think clearly and find the right words. The emotions are so strong they hijack your ability to reason and communicate.
* **Shame and Guilt:**  If you feel shame or guilt about the situation, it can add another layer of difficulty. Shame can make you want to hide and avoid acknowledging the problem.
* **Lack of a Vocabulary for Feelings:**  We all have our own unique way of experiencing emotions. It's possible you haven’t developed a rich vocabulary for describing what you're feeling.

**3. The Dynamics with Your Parents/Step-Parents:**

* **Communication Styles:**  Your parents or step-parents might have communication styles that are unintentionally intimidating or difficult to navigate. They might be critical, demanding, or have a way of questioning you that makes it hard to open up.
* **Past Experiences:**  If there's a history of conflict or tension within the family, it can create a feeling of anxiety and make it harder to trust and communicate.
* **Fear of Consequences:**  You may be afraid of the consequences of speaking up, which reinforces the silence.

**What You Can Do - It’s a Process, Not a Quick Fix:**

* **Recognize Your Response:** The first step is simply recognizing that this is happening. Knowing *why* you're crying can help you feel a little more in control.
* **Safe Space for Yourself:**  Find a safe space where you can process your feelings privately. This could be your room, a journal, or a trusted friend (if you have one).
* **Start Small:** Don't try to tackle the big issue right away. Begin by practicing identifying basic emotions.  ""I'm feeling sad,"" ""I'm feeling frustrated,"" ""I'm feeling anxious.""
* **Use ""I"" Statements:** When you do start to communicate, try using ""I"" statements to express your feelings without blaming.  For example, ""I feel overwhelmed when I'm asked about this.""
* **Write It Down:** If you can't find the words, try writing down what you're feeling.  Sometimes getting it on paper can help you process it.
* **Talk to Someone You Trust (Outside the Family):**  A school counselor, therapist, or trusted adult outside your family can provide a safe and supportive space to talk about your feelings.
* **Consider Therapy:** A therapist can help you develop coping mechanisms, improve your communication skills, and address any underlying issues that might be contributing to this pattern.

**Important Note:**  You are not responsible for your parents' reactions. While it's important to try to communicate, you don't have to tolerate abusive or disrespectful behavior.

3416,"I've been bullied for years and the teachers have done nothing about it. I haven't been diagnosed with depression, but i have been extremely sad for years.

How can I deal with being bullied at school when the teachers won't help?","To be bullied is very painful.I'm glad you know the bullies are doing the wrong thing and whatever they are telling you is pure meanness.Depending on how independent you feel, why not tell either your classroom teacher or schedule an appointment with the vice principal?Bullying other students is taken very seriously in some states and schools are expected to address the bullying until the victimized student feels safe.If you hesitate to do this on your own, then would you ask either of your parents or even a friend of yours who is also in the school, to report the problem?In case you are afraid the bullies will retaliate for reporting them, then tell this to whatever school authority you decide to ask for help.You're entitled to be protected by your school.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it’s completely understandable that you're feeling this way. Being bullied for years, compounded by the fact that teachers haven't intervened, is incredibly draining and isolating. It’s fantastic that you’re recognizing this and seeking ways to cope – that's a really important first step. Let's break down how you can approach this, focusing on what you *can* control and building a support system.

**1. Prioritize Your Safety & Well-being:**

* **Recognize It's Not Your Fault:** This is absolutely crucial. Bullying is *never* the fault of the person being bullied. The bullies are acting out of their own insecurities and issues, and their behavior is unacceptable.  Repeat this to yourself constantly.
* **Avoid the Bully:**  As much as possible, try to avoid situations where you're alone with the bully. Stick with friends, stay in populated areas, and if you can, alter your routes through the school.
* **Don't Engage:** Bullies thrive on reaction.  Don't argue, don't retaliate, don't try to reason with them.  A simple, neutral ""Leave me alone"" or no response can be powerful.
* **Document Everything:** This is really important, even if it feels overwhelming. Keep a detailed record of every incident:
    * **Date and Time:**
    * **Location:**
    * **What Happened:** Be specific about what the bully said or did.
    * **Witnesses:**  Note anyone who saw the incident.
    * **Your Reaction:**  How did you feel?

**2. Build a Support System – You Don't Have to Do This Alone:**

* **Talk to Someone You Trust:** This could be a family member, a trusted friend, a counselor, a religious leader, or anyone you feel safe with. Just talking about it can make a huge difference.
* **School Counselor (Even if Teachers Aren't Helping):**  Sometimes school counselors have more authority than the classroom teachers.  Schedule an appointment specifically to discuss the bullying and your concerns about the lack of intervention. Bring your documentation.
* **Friends:** Lean on your friends for support.  They can offer a listening ear, distraction, and a sense of camaraderie.
* **Outside Support:** Consider seeking support from outside organizations:
    * **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741 – this is free, confidential support 24/7.

    * **StopBullying.gov:** [https://www.stopbullying.gov/](https://www.stopbullying.gov/) – comprehensive information and resources.

**3. Addressing the Lack of Teacher Intervention:**

* **Formal Complaint:**  Because the teachers aren't helping, you need to escalate.  Speak to the principal or assistant principal.  Present your documentation clearly and calmly.  Explain that you've repeatedly tried to get help from the teachers and that the bullying is continuing.  Ask for a specific plan of action.
* **School Board:** If the principal isn't responsive, consider contacting the school board.
* **Legal Options (Consider with Counselors):** In extreme cases of harassment or threats, you may want to explore legal options with a lawyer specializing in bullying or education law. (This is usually a last resort).

**4. Managing Your Sadness & Emotions:**

* **Acknowledge Your Feelings:** It’s okay to feel sad, angry, frustrated, and hopeless. Don’t try to suppress these emotions.
* **Self-Care:**  Engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. This could include:
    * **Exercise:** Even a short walk can make a difference.
    * **Hobbies:**  Make time for activities you enjoy.
    * **Relaxation Techniques:**  Deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.
* **Therapy:**  Even though you haven’t been diagnosed with depression, talking to a therapist can help you develop coping strategies and process your emotions.  They can also assess if you might benefit from further evaluation.

**Important Note About Depression:**  Your persistent sadness over years is significant. While you haven't been formally diagnosed, it's important to acknowledge it and seek professional help if it’s not improving with your coping strategies.  A therapist can help you explore the underlying causes of your sadness and develop a treatment plan if needed.

1756,"Sometimes, when I look at my pet cat, I think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him. It makes me sad because I love him, but I always think about how helpless he is. There've even been split-seconds where I felt almost tempted to kick him, followed by shame and guilt.","A lot of different things could be happening here. Do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is? If you have not actually kicked him, then I would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt, since you did not hurt him. What else is there?It would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you. It could be that you feel safe with your cat, so strong emotions come up because you feel safe.","Okay, what you're describing is a really complex and surprisingly common experience, and it's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge and talk about it. It sounds like you're grappling with a really powerful, and frankly unsettling, mix of emotions – deep love and protectiveness for your cat, coupled with a disturbing awareness of his vulnerability and, as you put it, almost a primal urge to control that vulnerability. Let's break down what might be happening here and why it's okay to feel this way, while also recognizing the need to address the troubling aspects.

**Understanding the Roots of These Feelings**

* **Love and Protective Instincts:** Your love for your cat is a natural and beautiful thing. It’s completely normal to want to protect someone you care about, especially a vulnerable creature like a cat. The instinct to shield them from harm is deeply ingrained.
* **Recognizing Vulnerability:** You've clearly noticed your cat's helplessness. Cats are physically small and reliant on us for care. This awareness of their dependence can understandably trigger a strong protective response.
* **The ""Temptation"" – A Complex Response:** The split-second thoughts of kicking him, followed by shame and guilt, are the most important part to unpack. This isn't necessarily a reflection of a malicious intent, but rather a manifestation of several things:
    * **Frustration with Inability to Control:**  We humans have a strong need to control our environment and the people around us. When we can't control something (like a cat's unpredictable behavior), it can be intensely frustrating. The urge to ""fix"" the situation, even in a misguided way, is a common response to that frustration.
    * **Primitive Instincts:**  Some researchers believe that these fleeting thoughts are rooted in very basic, almost instinctual responses – perhaps a remnant of our ancestors’ need to manage threats to their young. It's a very primal reaction to perceived danger.
    * **Emotional Regulation Difficulty:**  Sometimes, these intense, intrusive thoughts can be linked to difficulties with emotional regulation.  Feeling overwhelmed or stressed can amplify these feelings.

**Why It's Okay to Feel This Way (and What to Do)**

* **It Doesn't Make You a Bad Person:** Seriously. Having these thoughts doesn’t make you a cruel or abusive person. It’s a sign that you’re deeply attuned to your cat’s needs and feelings. The fact that you immediately feel shame and guilt is a positive indicator that you recognize the problematic nature of those thoughts.
* **Acknowledge and Validate the Feelings:**  Don't try to suppress or ignore these thoughts. Acknowledge them, name them (""I'm having a thought about wanting to control my cat's behavior""), and accept that they're there. This is the first step in managing them.
* **Shift Your Focus:** When you notice these thoughts arising, consciously shift your focus to something positive about your cat – his purr, his playful antics, the comfort he brings you.  Engage in a loving interaction with him.
* **Explore the Underlying Stress:** Are there other stressors in your life that might be contributing to these feelings?  Stress, anxiety, or even just feeling overwhelmed can amplify these kinds of intrusive thoughts.  Consider stress-reduction techniques like mindfulness, meditation, or gentle exercise.

**Important – Seeking Support**

Because you’re experiencing this with such intensity and feeling shame, it’s important to consider talking to someone. Here are some options:

* **Therapist or Counselor:** A therapist can help you explore the root causes of these feelings, develop coping mechanisms, and address any underlying emotional issues. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be particularly helpful in managing intrusive thoughts.
* **Trusted Friend or Family Member:** Talking to someone you trust can provide support and perspective.
* **Online Resources:**  There are many online resources available for managing intrusive thoughts and anxiety.  The Anxiety & Depression Association of America (ADAA) is a good place to start: [https://www.adaa.org/](https://www.adaa.org/)

2335,"When I see something I don’t like, I go off like a ticking time bomb. I go from “0 to 100” really quickly.","Sometimes we react to situations immediately, without thinking of the consequences of our actions. Typically by not reacting right away, we are better able to gather our thoughts, see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives, and respond more calmly. One of the strategies that almost always helps is deep breathing. When faced with a stressful situation, you can give yourself a time out by removing yourself from the stress and spend 5 minutes taking deep breaths (breathe in slowly counting to 4 and breathe out even slower counting to 6), while focusing and thinking only about your breathing. After doing so, think of the various ways you can respond to the situation and choose the one most appropriate. Good luck!","Okay, that's a really common and frustrating experience, and it’s good you’re recognizing it. What you're describing sounds like a pretty intense reaction – going from ""0 to 100"" very quickly when you encounter something you dislike. That’s often referred to as a strong emotional response, and it can feel overwhelming. 

Let's break this down a little bit. Here's what I'm hearing, and some things to consider:

**1. Understanding the ""Ticking Time Bomb"" Feeling:**

* **Amygdala Activation:** This rapid shift is likely driven by your amygdala, the part of your brain responsible for processing emotions, particularly fear and anger. When something triggers a negative feeling, the amygdala can quickly activate, leading to a surge of adrenaline and a strong emotional response.
* **Fight, Flight, or Freeze:** This rapid response often aligns with the ""fight, flight, or freeze"" response. It’s your body’s instinct to deal with a perceived threat.
* **Lack of Regulation:** You've described going from ""0 to 100,"" suggesting you might not have the tools to regulate those initial feelings.


**2. Why This Happens (Potential Contributing Factors):**

* **Triggers:** What *specifically* triggers these reactions? Are there certain types of people, situations, or behaviors that consistently cause this? Identifying your triggers is the first step.
* **Past Experiences:** Often, these intense reactions are rooted in past experiences – perhaps a similar situation in the past caused you pain or distress.
* **Sensitivity:** Some people are naturally more sensitive to criticism, negativity, or perceived injustices.
* **Perfectionism/High Standards:** If you hold yourself and others to very high standards, you might be more easily triggered by anything that falls short.
* **Anxiety:** Anxiety can amplify emotional responses.

**3. What You Can Do (Strategies for Managing It):**

* **Recognize It Early:** The key is to become aware *before* you hit ""100.""  Start noticing the physical signs – increased heart rate, tense muscles, rapid breathing – as the feeling starts to build.
* **Take a Pause:** When you notice these signs, *immediately* take a step back.  This could be physically stepping away, taking a deep breath, or saying something like, ""I need a moment to process this.""
* **Grounding Techniques:** These techniques help you bring yourself back to the present moment:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Name 5 things you see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:** Slow, deliberate deep breaths can calm your nervous system.
* **Challenge Your Thoughts:** Once you've calmed down, examine the situation. Are your thoughts overly negative or judgmental? Are you jumping to conclusions?
* **Reframe the Situation:** Can you find a more balanced or constructive way to view the situation?
* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself. It's okay to have strong feelings. Don't beat yourself up for reacting intensely.

**Important Note:** If these reactions are significantly impacting your life – causing you distress, interfering with your relationships, or leading to unhealthy behaviors, it's a good idea to talk to a therapist or counselor. They can help you explore the underlying causes and develop more effective coping strategies.

**To help me understand your situation a little better and offer more tailored advice, could you tell me a bit more about:**

*   **What kinds of things typically trigger these reactions?** (e.g., rude comments, messy environments, certain people, etc.)
*   **Can you give me a specific example of a recent situation where you experienced this?** (Just a brief description would be helpful.)",0.4884851574897766

1675,"He's been losing feelings and he doesn't know why. I love him very very much. He sometimes thinks I'm obsessed when I'm not at all. I give him his space and I make sure he's okay but sometimes I think if me and him saw each other more it would be better? I truly want me and him to get better, it's kind of hard not to stress about it, because the love of my life is losing feelings which is a sad feeling. He's a great guy! I just don't know why he's been losing feelings towards me. He's starting to put less effort in talking to me. At this point I'll do anything to just make us better as a couple. I tried talking to him but he doesn't like talking about it much. Advice on what to do?","I'm willing to bet that this isn't what you are hoping to hear, but I'd suggest giving him space. Ooph, that's a tough one, right?! I know. But here's the thing, when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away. He needs to feel like a solid and whole person (as you do too) to be able to be fully in your relationship. It's the work of being in relationship to learn this. I get that this is tough stuff. I wonder, outside of being with him, how do you soothe and calm yourself? That's the stuff for you to tune into and focus on right now.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling stressed, heartbroken, and desperate to fix things. It’s incredibly painful to watch someone you love lose feelings, and the added layer of him thinking you're obsessed is making it even more complicated. Let's break this down and figure out a path forward.

**1. Validate Your Feelings & Acknowledge the Complexity:**

* **It’s Okay to Feel This Way:** You're not overreacting. Losing feelings is a huge issue, and your distress is completely valid. Don't invalidate your own feelings of worry, sadness, and fear.
* **Recognize the Dynamic:** You’ve already identified a key issue: he's perceiving your care as obsession, and he's pulling back. This isn't necessarily about *you*, it’s about his experience and how he's processing things.

**2. Understanding His Perspective (Without Pressuring Him):**

* **Space is Important, But...:** You're right to give him space, but *too much* space can sometimes be a symptom of underlying issues. It's possible he needs more space *because* he’s struggling to connect.
* **Gentle Inquiry (Not a Demand):** Instead of a big conversation about ""losing feelings,"" try very gentle, open-ended questions.  Something like: ""I've noticed we haven't been connecting as much lately, and I'm feeling a little worried.  I want to understand how you're feeling and if there's anything I can do to support you.  Can you tell me a little bit about what's been on your mind?""  **Crucially, listen more than you talk.**  Don't try to fix it or convince him. Just hear him out.
* **Focus on *His* Needs:** Frame your concern around *his* well-being. “I care about you so much, and I'm noticing you seem a little distant. I want to make sure you’re okay and feeling supported.”

**3. What Might Be Going On (Considering He’s Losing Feelings):**

* **Stress & External Factors:** Is he under a lot of stress at work, with family, or financially? Stress can significantly impact emotions and relationships.
* **Unresolved Issues:** Could there be something he’s not talking about – a past trauma, a worry about the future, a feeling of inadequacy – that’s contributing to this?
* **Depression/Anxiety:** Loss of feelings can be a symptom of depression or anxiety. It’s important to acknowledge this possibility.
* **Changes in His Own Life:** Has there been any significant change in his life (job, city, etc.) that might be affecting him?
* **He's Processing Something:** He may be struggling to understand his own feelings about the relationship and needs space to do so.

**4. Actions You Can Take (Without Being Overbearing):**

* **Small, Consistent Acts of Kindness:** Continue to show you care through small gestures – a thoughtful text, a shared activity you both enjoy, a small gift that shows you were thinking of him. Don’t overdo it.
* **Quality Time (When He's Open):** If he's willing to spend time together, focus on activities you both genuinely enjoy.  Don’t force conversation; let it flow naturally.
* **Respect His Boundaries:** If he says he needs space, give it to him. But also, gently let him know you're there when he's ready.
* **Self-Care:** This is *essential*. You can’t pour from an empty cup. Focus on your own well-being – hobbies, friends, activities that make you happy. This will help you cope with the uncertainty.

**5. What *Not* To Do:**

* **Don’t Beg or Plead:** This will likely push him further away.
* **Don’t Try to “Fix” Him:** You can't force someone to feel something they don't.
* **Don’t Take It Personally (As Much As Possible):** While it’s incredibly difficult, try to remember that this isn’t necessarily about you as a person.

**Important Note:**  You mentioned wanting to “do anything.”  While your love is genuine, it's important to set boundaries for yourself. You can't control his feelings or behavior. You can only control your own actions and reactions.

**Seeking External Support:**

* **Couples Counseling:** If possible, suggest couples counseling. A therapist can provide a neutral space to communicate and explore the issues.
* **Individual Therapy (For You):**  Talking to a therapist yourself can help you process your feelings and develop coping strategies.

**Final Thoughts:**

This is a very delicate situation, and there’s no guarantee of a positive outcome. However, by approaching it with empathy, respect, and a focus on communication, you’re giving yourself the best chance of navigating this difficult time.  Prioritize your own well-being throughout this process.

*   How long has he been losing feelings?

2756,"I believe my partner has a masturbation and porn problem. He masturbates daily, even when I am lying in bed sleeping beside him. We have sex once a week. He is rough and worries about his needs. He never touches me, and treats me like a porn star, wanting to finish on my face or chest.","It sounds like your in quite a rough place, my recommendation just based on what you type might warrant a visit to a psychotherapist to resolve what may be going on, I am not entirely sure but it sounds like he might have a bit of a sex addiction problem. One thing you need to ask yourself is ""Am I happy?"", ""Do I feel loved?"", these are deep questions, but the answers to those questions will give you a direction to travel in. ","Okay, this is a really complex and understandably painful situation for you. What you're describing – the daily masturbation, the rough handling, the lack of intimacy, and the feeling of being treated like a prop – is deeply concerning and signals a significant disconnect in your relationship. It’s brave of you to acknowledge this and seek understanding. Let's break down what might be happening and, more importantly, what you can do about it.

**Understanding What Might Be Going On:**

* **Compulsive Behavior:** Daily masturbation, especially when persistent and seemingly uncontrollable, can be a sign of compulsive sexual behavior. This isn't necessarily about shame or guilt, but can be rooted in anxiety, stress, or unmet needs. It can become a way to cope with difficult emotions.
* **Porn Addiction/Compulsion:**  The intensity and frequency you describe strongly suggest a potential issue with pornography. Pornography can create unrealistic expectations about sex, desensitize individuals to real-life intimacy, and lead to a craving for stimulation that’s difficult to satisfy through a partner.
* **Emotional Needs Not Being Met:** Your partner's behavior – the roughness, the lack of touch, and the focus on finishing you – suggests he might be struggling to connect emotionally and physically with you. He may be seeking a highly stimulating experience that doesn't require genuine connection.
* **Desensitization:**  Pornography can desensitize individuals to the natural variations in sensation and response that occur in real-life intimacy.  This can lead to a demand for extreme stimulation.
* **Lack of Communication & Vulnerability:** The distance you feel suggests a lack of vulnerability and open communication between you. He’s not sharing his feelings or needs, and you're feeling ignored and devalued.

**What You Can Do - A Multi-Faceted Approach:**

1. **Prioritize Your Own Wellbeing:** This situation is draining and hurtful.  Focus on taking care of yourself – your emotional, mental, and physical health.  Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist for support.  Don't minimize the impact this is having on you.

2. **Communicate Clearly and Directly (But Carefully):** This is the hardest part, and needs to be approached with sensitivity. Here’s how to start:
   * **""I need to talk about something that’s really important to me, and it’s difficult for me to express. I’ve been feeling a significant distance between us, and I’m struggling with how I’m being treated during intimacy.""** (Start with a gentle, non-accusatory approach.)
   * **Specifically address the behaviors:** ""When you [describe the rough handling/focus on finishing you], it makes me feel [uncomfortable, devalued, ignored, etc.]. I need to feel like I'm the priority, and I need to feel genuinely connected with you.""
   * **Express your needs:** “I need to feel like you’re truly present with me, and that we’re exploring our intimacy together, not just seeking a specific stimulation.”
   * **Avoid accusations and blame:** Framing it as *your* feelings and *your* needs is crucial.  “I feel…” rather than “You always…”

3. **Encourage Professional Help:** This is *key*.  Suggesting therapy for him, and potentially for yourself, is a vital step.
   * **Therapy for him:**  A therapist can help him understand the root of his compulsive behaviors, develop healthier coping mechanisms, and address any underlying emotional issues. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is often effective for compulsive behaviors.
   * **Couple's Therapy:** If he’s willing, couple's therapy can provide a safe space to address communication issues and rebuild intimacy.
   * **Individual Therapy for You:**  A therapist can help you process your feelings, build your self-esteem, and develop healthy boundaries.

4. **Establish Clear Boundaries:** You have the right to be treated with respect and to have your needs met in a relationship.
   * **Verbal Boundaries:** ""I'm not comfortable with [specific behavior]. I need you to respect my boundaries.""
   * **Physical Boundaries:**  If he continues to engage in behaviors you find unacceptable, you may need to step away from the situation.

5. **Consider a ""Time Out"":** If he’s resistant to seeking help or respecting your boundaries, you may need to create some space for yourself to protect your wellbeing.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Don’t Enable:**  Avoid reinforcing his behavior by indulging in the behaviors you find unacceptable.
* **Don’t Take it Personally:**  His behavior is likely a reflection of his own struggles, not a judgment of you.
* **Be Patient (But Firm):** Change takes time and effort.

Starting therapy is a huge step, and it's incredibly common to have anxieties about it, especially when you’re worried about emotional vulnerability. Let's tackle this – the crying and embarrassment fear.

**Is it something to worry about? Absolutely, it’s a valid concern, but it doesn't have to derail your entire experience.** Many people experience crying in therapy, and it’s often a *good* thing. Let’s break down why and what you can do about it:

**1. Why Crying Happens in Therapy:**

* **Emotional Release:** Therapy creates a safe space to explore difficult emotions. These emotions can be deeply buried and, when brought to the surface, naturally trigger tears. It’s a release – a physical manifestation of processing something painful.
* **Trust and Connection:** Crying often stems from feeling a connection with your therapist. It indicates you're starting to trust them and feel safe enough to be vulnerable.
* **Past Trauma:** If you have a history of trauma, past experiences can resurface unexpectedly.
* **The Therapeutic Process Itself:** The act of talking about difficult things is inherently emotional. It's not a sign of weakness; it’s a sign you’re engaged in the process.
* **It's Okay to Be Human:**  Therapy isn't about presenting a perfect, emotionless self. It’s about being *you*, with all your feelings.

**2. Addressing Your Fear of Embarrassment:**

* **Your Therapist is Trained for This:** Therapists are used to clients crying. They've developed strategies to handle it calmly and supportively. They won't judge you.  It's part of their role.
* **Focus on the Process, Not the Performance:** Try to shift your thinking. It's not about *appearing* a certain way; it's about genuinely exploring your feelings.
* **Remind Yourself It’s Temporary:** Tears are temporary. Even if they do happen, your therapist will help you through it.
* **You're in Control (to a Degree):** You don't *have* to talk about anything you're not ready for.  You can say something like, ""I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed right now,"" or ""I need a moment to collect my thoughts.""

**3. What You Can Do to Prepare (Without Obsessing):**

* **Talk to Your Therapist Beforehand:** Many therapists offer a brief phone consultation before your first session. This is a great opportunity to discuss your anxieties and ask any questions you have.  You can say something like, ""I'm a little nervous about starting therapy, and I'm worried about potentially getting emotional. Could you reassure me that's okay?""
* **Grounding Techniques:** Learn some simple grounding techniques (like deep breathing, 5-4-3-2-1, or focusing on your senses) to use if you start to feel overwhelmed.
* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself! Recognize that you're embarking on a challenging but potentially transformative journey.

**4. What to Say If You Start to Feel Overwhelmed:**

* ""I'm feeling a little overwhelmed right now.""
* ""I need to take a moment.""
* ""Can we slow down?""
* ""I'm finding this difficult to talk about.""

**Important Note:** Your therapist's response will likely be supportive and reassuring. They'll likely offer a tissue, ask if you're okay, and help you gently move forward.

**Ultimately, your fear is a natural reaction to vulnerability. It doesn't mean anything is wrong with you or with the process.  It's a sign you're engaged and invested in your well-being.**

810,How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,This is a tough decision to make for anyone that has ever been involved in a relationship.  My advice is for you to consider what is making you unhappy in this relationship.  Sometimes we think we are ready to move on but don't know the reason why and then we regret it.  The worst thing you want after the fact is to have regret.  Take time to do some soul searching and imagine your life without this person before you make any decisions.  This will also help you understand what it is you are looking for in a romantic relationship. Best of luck in your love life. Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling,"Okay, this is a really tough and important question, and it's great that you're taking the time to think it through. There's no easy answer, and it's a deeply personal decision. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, broken down into steps and considerations:

**1. Self-Reflection - Understanding Your Feelings:**

* **Identify the Core Issues:** Don't just say ""I'm unhappy."" Dig deeper. What *specifically* is making you unhappy? Make a list. Be honest with yourself, even if it's uncomfortable. Examples:
    * **Lack of Communication:** Do you feel like you can't talk to him about important things? Do you feel unheard?
    * **Different Values/Goals:** Are you fundamentally on different paths in life (e.g., career, family, religion)?
    * **Lack of Emotional Connection:** Do you feel a lack of intimacy, vulnerability, or genuine connection?
    * **Trust Issues:** Is there a breach of trust, or do you constantly worry about his fidelity or honesty?
    * **Conflict Patterns:** Do you constantly argue about the same things? Are arguments destructive?
    * **Feeling Drained/Unfulfilled:** Do you feel like you're losing yourself in the relationship?
    * **Resentment:** Are you holding onto anger or bitterness?
    * **Loss of Attraction:** Has the physical or emotional attraction faded?
* **Rate the Issues:**  On a scale of 1-10, how significant is each issue?  This helps you prioritize.
* **How Long Have You Felt This Way?:** Is this a recent development, or has it been building over time?  Chronic issues are harder to fix.
* **What Are You *Really* Missing?:**  Sometimes, unhappiness in a relationship is actually a symptom of something missing in your own life (e.g., self-esteem, a sense of purpose, social connections).  Consider if the relationship is exacerbating those feelings.
* **What Are You Contributing?:** Be honest - are you contributing to the problems in the relationship? Are you communicating your needs effectively? Are you willing to compromise?

**2. Assessing the Relationship:**

* **Is There a Future?**  Honestly assess if you can see a future with this person *as you are*.  Don't romanticize a ""perfect"" future; think about the realistic challenges you'd face.
* **Have You Tried to Fix Things?:** Have you and your boyfriend discussed your concerns openly and honestly? Have you tried to work on the issues together? (This doesn’t mean arguing endlessly; it means actively trying to find solutions). If you haven’t, it might be a sign you’re not both invested in saving the relationship.
* **Is He Willing to Change?:** If you've discussed issues, is he willing to acknowledge them and make an effort to change?  Some people are resistant to feedback or unwilling to compromise.
* **What is the Dynamic Like?**  Observe the overall pattern of your interactions.  Is it generally positive, supportive, and respectful? Or is it characterized by negativity, control, or disrespect?

**3. Considering Your Options:**

* **Option 1: Work on the Relationship:** If you believe there's a chance to fix things, commit to actively working on it. This requires both of you to be fully invested.  Consider couples counseling if you’re struggling to communicate effectively.
* **Option 2: Take a Break:** A temporary separation can provide clarity and perspective.  Establish clear ground rules for the break (e.g., no contact, specific time frame).
* **Option 3: End the Relationship:** If you've tried everything and you're still deeply unhappy, or if the relationship is fundamentally unhealthy, ending it may be the best option for your well-being.

**4. Important Considerations Before Making a Decision:**

* **Listen to Your Gut:** Sometimes, your intuition can tell you something your logical mind isn’t fully grasping.  Pay attention to that feeling.
* **Don’t Stay Out of Fear:** Don’t stay in a relationship because you’re afraid of being alone, of hurting him, or of what others might think.
* **Prioritize Your Happiness:** You deserve to be in a relationship that brings you joy, fulfillment, and support.
* **Don't Make a Rash Decision:** Take your time.  Allow yourself to feel your emotions and process them before making a final decision.

52,"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","The short answer is: absolutely not! The longer answer is that it might take some time to process all of the issues, and it may feel quite ""muddy"" in the issues for a lot longer than is tolerable (which is why counseling may have been postponed to begin with for you.) It's important to be realistic when entering counseling of any sort, and that the therapist be realistic with you about what you might be able to expect working with that person (I use the words ""might be able to expect"" because therapy experiences can vary.) But that not having counseling about trauma that you have experienced much earlier in your life can play a significant role in the process and how long that process could take to unpack all that may have been buried over time.It might also be helpful in counseling to work with the therapist on figuring out where to begin, but to also manage the feelings of being overwhelmed that may make it hard to continue to show up and do the work required, week in and week out. It isn't easy work trying to process past pain that you experienced, and so consistent practice of self-care, including leaning on support systems outside of therapy, is key.","Okay, let's tackle this. It's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge all you're carrying and to reach out for support. The fact that you've identified so many complex issues – the history of sexual abuse, breast cancer, chronic insomnia, a long history of depression, emerging anxiety, and low self-esteem – is absolutely understandable. And honestly, it's a *lot*, but it doesn't mean you have ""too many"" issues to address in counseling. In fact, it suggests you’re recognizing the depth and complexity of your experience, which is a really positive first step.

Here’s a breakdown of why you don’t have too many issues, and how to approach it:

**1. The Interconnectedness of Your Issues:**

* **Trauma's Impact:** The sexual abuse is a foundational trauma that has likely colored *everything* else in your life. It's almost certainly a root cause of your depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and how you relate to yourself and others. Trauma doesn't just show up as one isolated event; it reshapes your brain and your emotional responses.
* **Chronic Illness & Mental Health:** Breast cancer is a significant stressor, and the experience of being a cancer survivor can be profoundly impactful. It can exacerbate existing vulnerabilities and potentially trigger new ones. The chronic nature of insomnia is also a huge factor, as it disrupts sleep patterns, affects mood, and can worsen anxiety.
* **They Feed Each Other:** Your depression and anxiety are likely intertwined with your trauma and insomnia. The insomnia can worsen your mood, and the depression and anxiety can make it harder to sleep. It's a cyclical pattern.

**2. Why It Doesn't Feel Overwhelming:**

* **You've Identified Them:** The fact that you've recognized these issues is *huge*.  Many people struggling with these challenges don't even fully understand the extent of their difficulties.
* **You're Seeking Help:**  You've taken the crucial step of wanting to address these things. That desire itself is a powerful force for change.
* **Counseling is Structured:** A good therapist won’t try to tackle everything at once. They’ll work with you to prioritize and create a manageable plan.

**3. How to Approach Counseling – It’s About Prioritization & Phased Approach:**

* **Start with Trauma:** Given the history of sexual abuse, starting with trauma-informed therapy is generally recommended. Therapies like EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) adapted for trauma, or Narrative Therapy can be incredibly helpful in processing and healing from the impact of this experience.
* **Secondary Issues:** Once you’ve made some progress with the trauma, you can then begin to address the other issues – your cancer experience, insomnia, depression, and anxiety – in a more targeted way.
* **Focus on Building Self-Esteem:**  Low self-esteem is often a consequence of trauma. Therapy can help you challenge negative self-beliefs and develop a more positive self-image.
* **Communication with Your Therapist:** Be completely open and honest with your therapist about *everything*. Don't try to hide anything, even if it feels scary. They are there to help you, not to judge you. Let them know your priorities – what feels most urgent to address.

**4. Finding the Right Therapist:**

* **Trauma-Informed Therapist:** Look for a therapist who specializes in trauma.  This is *essential* given your history.
* **Licensed Professional:** Ensure they are licensed (e.g., LCSW, LMFT, Psychologist).
* **Good Fit:**  It’s important to find a therapist you feel comfortable with and trust. Don’t be afraid to “shop around” until you find the right fit.

How can I get my life back?","Slowly is the rate at which you'll get back your life.Being traumatized means not feeling safe in almost all areas of life.Be patient with yourself as you try to regain trust that people will not harm you and will be sources of satisfaction in your life.It is possible that the trauma in your life requires such great attention on your part to your own inner emotional safety that you are better off with a less intensive job than the one you recently lost.Try to prioritize restoring your emotional and psychological health.  With this as the top area of your attention then you may have an easier time to accept a lesser degree of involvement in your work and relationships.When you feel angry, try to examine if underlying the anger are feelings of stress, fear, insecurity regarding your position in relationship to the person toward whom you feel angry.   Anger is often the surface reaction to more destabilizing emotions like fear and insecurity.Gradually by nurturing and comforting yourself, living at a pace which is uniquely comfortable to what and how much you can handle, you'll regain your trust in both yourself and relating to others.","Okay, it takes incredible strength to even recognize this and reach out for help. You've already taken a huge first step. It’s completely understandable that you're feeling this way – PTSD can have a devastating impact on every area of your life, and it's not a sign of weakness, but a testament to the trauma you've experienced. Let's break this down and talk about how you can start getting your life back.  I want to be clear: I'm an AI and can't provide therapy or medical advice, but I can offer guidance and resources.

**1. Prioritize Your Mental Health – This is Non-Negotiable**

* **Therapy is Crucial:** You absolutely need to be working with a therapist specializing in PTSD. There are several effective therapies:
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Helps you change negative thought patterns and behaviors.
    * **Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT):** Specifically designed for trauma survivors.
    * **Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR):** Another effective therapy for processing traumatic memories.
    * **Prolonged Exposure Therapy:** Gradually exposing yourself to trauma-related memories and situations in a safe environment.
    * **Finding a Therapist:**  Here are some resources:
        * **Psychology Today Therapist Finder:** [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) (Filter by PTSD)
        * **SAMHSA National Helpline:** 1-800-662-HELP (4357) – Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. They can provide referrals.
        * **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741 – Free, 24/7 crisis support.
        * **The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI):** [https://www.nami.org/](https://www.nami.org/) –  Offers support groups and resources.

* **Medication:**  Talk to a psychiatrist or doctor about medication.  SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are often prescribed for PTSD symptoms like anxiety and depression.  Finding the right medication and dosage can take time and experimentation.

* **Self-Care:** Alongside therapy, incorporate regular self-care practices. This could include:
    * **Mindfulness and Meditation:** Apps like Headspace or Calm can be helpful.
    * **Regular Exercise:** Even a short walk can make a difference.
    * **Healthy Diet:** Nourishing your body can improve your mood.
    * **Adequate Sleep:** Establish a regular sleep schedule.

**2. Addressing the Specific Impacts You’re Experiencing**

* **Sex:** PTSD can dramatically affect sexual desire, arousal, and pleasure.  Talk to your therapist about this specifically. They can help you understand the connection between your trauma and your sexual difficulties.  It's okay to explore this with a sex therapist as well.

* **Anger:**  PTSD can manifest as irritability, anger outbursts, and difficulty controlling emotions.  Therapy can teach you coping mechanisms for managing anger.  Again, a therapist specializing in anger management can be invaluable.

* **Relationships:** Trauma can strain relationships.  Communication is key.  Consider couples therapy if your partner is supportive.  Focus on setting healthy boundaries and expressing your needs clearly.

**3. Getting Back on Your Feet – Practical Steps**

* **Employment:** Losing your job is a significant setback. Don’t be too hard on yourself. Start small.
    * **Vocational Rehabilitation Services:** Contact your state's Department of Labor – they often have programs for people with disabilities (including PTSD) to help with job training and placement.
    * **Resume Writing & Job Search Assistance:**  Look for free or low-cost services through community organizations.
    * **Start with Part-Time or Temporary Work:**  Building confidence and experience is important.

* **Financial Assistance:**  Explore options like unemployment benefits or social assistance if needed.

* **Support Groups:**  Connecting with others who understand what you're going through can be incredibly helpful. NAMI and other organizations offer PTSD support groups.

**4. Important Reminders**

* **Be Patient:** Healing from PTSD takes time – often years. There will be good days and bad days. Don’t get discouraged by setbacks.
* **Celebrate Small Victories:** Acknowledge and appreciate every step you take, no matter how small.
* **Self-Compassion:** Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend going through a similar struggle.
* **Safety Plan:** Develop a safety plan with your therapist that outlines how to cope with triggers and manage overwhelming emotions.

1748,I read that you should ignore them and they have to come to a conclusion that they were wrong on their own terms. Is that correct?,"It is not correct because someone who is narcissistic believes they are always right.If you ignore the person, then their thinking is that there is something wrong with you.Ignoring the person to the degree this is possible in the situation or relationship, will spare you to be misunderstood further.","You've touched on a really important and often incredibly challenging aspect of conflict resolution! You're referring to the principle of **allowing the other person to make the mistake visible.** Let's break down why this is such a powerful technique and whether it's entirely correct – it's *mostly* correct, with some important nuances.

Here's a detailed explanation:

**The Core Idea: Letting Them Own It**

The strategy you described – ignoring an argument, letting the other person struggle to defend their position, and ultimately realize they were wrong – is rooted in a few key psychological principles:

* **Cognitive Dissonance:** This is a huge one. People are motivated to maintain consistency between their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. When confronted with evidence that contradicts their beliefs, they experience discomfort (dissonance).  If you immediately jump in to correct them, you’re essentially reducing that discomfort *for* them. They then don't have the opportunity to process the contradiction and come to their own understanding.
* **Self-Esteem & Ego:** People often have a strong need to feel competent and right. Directly correcting someone can feel like a personal attack on their intelligence or judgment.
* **Learning Through Struggle:**  Genuine learning and understanding often come from grappling with a problem, wrestling with conflicting ideas, and ultimately arriving at a solution independently.

**How it Works in Practice:**

1. **Listen Without Interrupting (Initially):**  Let the other person fully express their argument, even if you disagree vehemently. Don't jump in to refute them immediately. Just listen attentively.
2. **Ask Clarifying Questions (Sparingly):** Instead of directly challenging, ask questions that encourage them to elaborate and explain their reasoning.  Examples: ""Can you tell me more about why you believe that?"" or ""What led you to that conclusion?""  *The goal isn't to trap them, but to get them to articulate their thinking.*
3. **Silence (The Crucial Part):**  This is the hardest part. After they've finished their argument, *don't* immediately offer your perspective.  Allow a period of silence.  This allows the cognitive dissonance to kick in.  They'll start to question their own reasoning.
4. **Gentle Encouragement (If Needed):**  If the silence stretches on too long and they seem completely stuck, you *can* offer a very gentle prompt: ""Have you considered…?"" or ""I’m wondering if there’s another way to look at this.""

**Why it’s *Mostly* Correct – and the Nuances:**

* **It's Not About Being Passive:** This isn't about letting someone bully you or simply ignoring them.  It's about a strategic approach to communication.
* **Not Always Appropriate:** This technique *doesn't* work in all situations. It’s generally most effective when:
    * **The stakes aren’t incredibly high:** If someone is in immediate danger, you absolutely need to intervene.
    * **The relationship is healthy:** This strategy is more likely to be successful with people you respect and want to build a positive relationship with.
    * **The person is open to self-reflection:**  If someone is completely closed off and defensive, this approach is unlikely to work.
* **Sometimes a Gentle Correction is Necessary:**  In some cases, particularly when safety is at risk, a direct and clear explanation is required.

**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI and cannot provide psychological advice.  If you are struggling with conflict resolution or mental health issues, please consult with a qualified therapist or counselor.

3441,"What am I doing wrong? My wife and I are fighting all the time. What can I do? We don't agree on anything and she usually jumps to conclusions, which are usually wrong on how I feel. She is very family-oriented while all of my family left me on my butt, abused, ignored and messed up with me mentally. I'm not a family-oriented person. I only have two people in my life - my best friend and my wife.  

My mother forced my father out of my life so I do not know who he really is. We've gotten in contact but he just makes comments on how much I look like her when in fact I look more like him.  This makes me mad because I don't want to look like my mother. I hate her. All that she did was bring me down and make me homeless, which she was successful at.  I need guidance in my life.  I don't want to lose my wife but we need to have a space because we usually hit each other and it's not healthy. I'm dying to make our relationship healthy. I've never wanted anything more than this. Please help me. I need your advice.","Hello. It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight, and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage. I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now. Marriages take lots of work, and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young - good, bad, or indifferent. There are no easy answers to your questions, and I won't presume that my response to you will be the linch-pin that heals all your pain. But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. No one is perfect. We fail more often than we succeed, but in the end we learn, and that learning helps us grow. Yes, you're right, the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good, and need to stop. You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard, and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. Seeing a therapist for yourself, and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. You have issues that you need to resolve, that, while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life, they are separate from your marriage in many respects.Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. You can find these through local counseling resources. Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. If you belong to a religious or spiritual community, then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed, so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you.Lastly, parents are imperfect. Yep...its true. They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. We limp along and do our best. Having said that, we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future, no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid, and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. Both with ourselves, and toward other people. So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit.  I am sure that remains to be seen, but either way you both must be involved in saving it. If only one of you cares, then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. That's not fair. So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants, and work to create an amicable solution. All of this said, seek out supportive friends, and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life. One way or the other, you will benefit from it.Be well.","Okay, this is a *lot*, and it's incredibly brave of you to reach out and articulate all of this. It's clear you're carrying a huge weight of pain and trauma, and it's understandably impacting your relationship. Let's break this down and figure out a path forward.

**1. Understanding the Root of the Problem:**

* **Trauma is a Huge Factor:** You've described a seriously difficult childhood marked by abuse, neglect, and a fractured family. This isn't just about disagreements; it's about deeply ingrained patterns of distrust, fear, and emotional reactivity. Your reactions are likely stemming from this trauma, not just from your wife's behavior.
* **Communication Styles:** You've identified a key issue: your wife jumps to conclusions, and you likely react defensively. This creates a cycle of hurt and misunderstanding. It's not necessarily about her *trying* to hurt you, but your past experiences are making you hyper-vigilant and prone to misinterpreting her intentions.
* **Different Values:** You're a person who values solitude and connection with a very small circle. Your wife is family-oriented, which is a fundamental difference. Trying to force yourself into a mold that doesn't fit you will cause ongoing friction.
* **The Father Figure:** The situation with your father is incredibly painful.  The attempt to compare you to your mother is a painful reminder of the damage done and a source of intense resentment.


**2. What You Can Do – Immediate Steps:**

* **Safety First:**  You mentioned hitting each other. This is absolutely unacceptable and needs to stop *immediately*.  Seek professional help – couples therapy *and* individual therapy.
* **Individual Therapy is Crucial:** You *need* to work through the trauma you've endured. A therapist specializing in trauma can help you understand your reactions, develop coping mechanisms, and address the underlying issues fueling your anger and defensiveness.
* **Start with ""I"" Statements:** When you feel yourself getting triggered, try to pause and start with ""I feel..."" instead of ""You always..."" This helps de-escalate the situation and focus on your own experience.  Example: Instead of ""You always jump to conclusions,"" try ""I feel misunderstood when I think you're assuming my intentions.""
* **Establish Boundaries:** You need to clearly define what you're willing to tolerate in the relationship. This isn't about controlling your wife; it's about protecting yourself emotionally.
* **Create Space:** You're right – you need space.  This doesn’t mean ending the relationship, but it does mean having designated times for yourselves to recharge and pursue your own interests.

**3. Couples Therapy – A Necessary Tool:**

* **Learn Communication Skills:** A therapist can teach you both how to communicate effectively, listen actively, and resolve conflicts constructively.
* **Address Underlying Issues:** Therapy can help you both understand how your past experiences are impacting your relationship.
* **Develop Empathy:**  It can help you see things from your wife’s perspective, even if you don’t agree with her.

**4. Regarding Your Father:**

* **Acceptance (as much as possible):** You can't change your father. Focusing on this comparison is only fueling your resentment.  Try to accept that he’s a separate person with his own issues.
* **Set Boundaries with Him:** You have the right to limit contact if it's causing you distress.

**5.  Important Considerations:**

* **Be Patient:** Healing takes time. There will be setbacks. Don't get discouraged.
* **Self-Care:** Prioritize your well-being – exercise, healthy eating, relaxation techniques, and pursuing activities you enjoy.
* **Don't Expect Perfection:** Your wife won’t suddenly become a mind reader.  You won’t instantly change your patterns. It’s a process of learning and growth.

857,I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"The best way to move on is to give yourself sufficient time and space away from your ex so you can heal.  That means no checking out your ex on social media platforms and no contact.  In order to move on and diminish the obsessions, help yourself recognize and accept that the relationship is over, and make sure to get sufficient support in processing all your feelings.  Once that takes place, it can be useful to explore and process with a professional the meaning of the relationship and to understand your part in what transpired.Sometimes people obsess because they have difficulties accepting what's already taken place and want things to be different.  The key to moving forward is to be loving toward yourself, to give yourself permission to grieve the loss, and to start cultivating new and healthy habits/patterns.  Reengage in your present life, ask yourself what you want your life to look like, and start creating goals and taking small steps to create the amazing life you want for yourself.","Okay, let's tackle this. It’s *completely* understandable that you're obsessing – breakups are incredibly painful and disruptive. The fact that you recognize it's happening and are reaching out for help is a huge first step. It shows you're not giving in to the pain. Let's be clear: there's no quick fix, and it's going to take time and effort. Here’s a breakdown of how to move on, broken down into categories:

**1. Acknowledge and Validate Your Feelings:**

* **Don’t Fight the Feelings:** Trying to suppress or deny your emotions will only make them stronger. Allow yourself to *feel* the sadness, anger, confusion, grief, whatever it is. It's okay to cry, scream into a pillow, or just sit with the pain.
* **Name It:**  Specifically identifying what you're feeling (""I'm feeling incredibly lonely,"" ""I'm angry that he didn't value me,"" ""I'm grieving the future we lost"") can help you process it.
* **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be incredibly therapeutic. Don’t censor yourself – just let it flow.
* **It's Okay to Not Be Okay:**  Repeat this to yourself. There’s no timeline for healing. Don’t compare your journey to anyone else’s.

**2. Break the Connection (Seriously):**

* **No Contact Rule:** This is *crucial*. It means no calls, texts, emails, social media stalking, or asking mutual friends about him/her. This is about protecting yourself and allowing yourself to detach. Even seemingly innocent checking can keep you stuck. Aim for at least 30-60 days of no contact.
* **Unfollow/Mute on Social Media:** This is incredibly important. Seeing his/her posts will only reopen the wound.  It’s okay to mute them temporarily, or even unfollow completely.
* **Remove Reminders:** Put away photos, gifts, and anything else that triggers painful memories. You don't have to throw them away (unless that feels right for you), but storing them out of sight helps.
* **Delete His/Her Number:** Seriously.  It's a barrier to moving on.

**3. Focus on Yourself – Rebuild Your Identity:**

* **Rediscover Your Interests:** What did you enjoy doing *before* the relationship?  Reconnect with hobbies you’ve neglected.
* **Try New Things:** This is a great time to step outside your comfort zone and explore new activities.  Take a class, join a club, learn a new skill.
* **Self-Care is Non-Negotiable:** Prioritize your physical and mental well-being.
    * **Exercise:** Even a short walk can boost your mood.
    * **Healthy Eating:** Nourish your body.
    * **Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep.
    * **Relaxation Techniques:** Meditation, yoga, deep breathing.
* **Set Small, Achievable Goals:**  Boosting your sense of accomplishment can help you regain control and confidence.

**4. Lean on Your Support System:**

* **Talk to Trusted Friends & Family:**  Share your feelings with people who will listen without judgment and offer support.
* **Join a Support Group:**  Connecting with others who have gone through similar experiences can be incredibly validating and helpful.
* **Consider Therapy:** A therapist can provide you with tools and strategies to cope with your emotions and process the breakup.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be particularly effective.

**5. Shift Your Perspective:**

* **Focus on the Future:** Instead of dwelling on the past, start thinking about what you want your life to be like.
* **Learn from the Experience:**  What did you learn about yourself? What do you want in a future relationship? (Without blaming him/her, of course).
* **Practice Gratitude:** Focusing on the good things in your life can help shift your perspective.
* **Remember Your Worth:**  A breakup does not diminish your value as a person. Remind yourself of your strengths and qualities.

**Important Reminders:**

* **Be Patient:** Healing takes time. There will be good days and bad days. Don’t get discouraged if you have setbacks.
* **Don't Romanticize the Relationship:** It's easy to remember only the good parts, but try to maintain a realistic perspective.
* **Avoid Rebound Relationships (Initially):** Jumping into a new relationship before you've healed can be detrimental.

2108,How does a person start the counseling process?,The first thing to do is to reflect on what you want to seek counseling. Search online and then set up a phone consultation. A person can find out a lot about a counselor and the services that they offer over the phone. After a consultation then set up an intake questions. The overall goal is to make sure that you are comfortable with the counselor and the services they can offer.,"Okay, let's break down how a person starts the counseling process. It can feel daunting, but understanding the steps can make it much more manageable. Here's a breakdown, covering everything from initial thoughts to the first session:

**1. Recognizing You Need Support & Taking the First Step:**

* **Self-Reflection:** The first step is often recognizing you're struggling with something that’s impacting your life – whether it’s anxiety, depression, relationship issues, grief, trauma, or just feeling generally overwhelmed.  It's about acknowledging that you could benefit from support.
* **Acceptance:** Accepting that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes courage to admit you need support.
* **Identifying What You Want to Achieve:**  Think about *why* you want to start counseling. What are your goals? Do you want to reduce symptoms, develop coping skills, improve relationships, or gain a better understanding of yourself?  Having a general idea will help you and the counselor work together.

**2. Researching & Finding a Counselor:**

* **Types of Counselors:** There are many different types of counselors, including:
    * **Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSW):** Often focus on mental health and social issues.
    * **Licensed Professional Counselors (LPC):**  Similar to LCSWs, providing therapy and counseling services.
    * **Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists (LMFT):**  Specialize in relationships and family dynamics.
    * **Psychologists:**  Typically have a doctoral degree (PhD or PsyD) and may conduct psychological testing.
    * **Psychiatrists:** Medical doctors who can prescribe medication.
* **Finding Resources:**
    * **Your Insurance Provider:** Start by checking your insurance company’s website or calling them to find therapists in your network. This will significantly impact your costs.
    * **Online Directories:**
        * **Psychology Today:** ([https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists)) – A very popular directory with detailed profiles.
        * **GoodTherapy.org:** ([https://www.goodtherapy.org/](https://www.goodtherapy.org/)) – Focuses on ethical and responsible therapy.
        * **Open Path Collective:** ([https://openpathcollective.org/](https://openpathcollective.org/)) – Offers affordable therapy options.
    * **Referrals:** Ask your primary care physician, trusted friends, or family members for recommendations.
* **Considering Specialization:** Look for a counselor who specializes in the area you're struggling with (e.g., anxiety, trauma, grief, substance abuse).

**3. Initial Contact & Scheduling:**

* **Initial Phone Call:** Most counselors offer a brief phone consultation (10-15 minutes). This is your opportunity to:
    * **Ask Questions:**  Don't hesitate to ask about their experience, approach to therapy, fees, and cancellation policies.
    * **Assess Compatibility:** Do you feel comfortable talking to this person? Do they seem approachable and understanding?
    * **Share Briefly (Optional):** You can briefly explain what you're hoping to address in therapy.
* **Scheduling the First Appointment:**  If you feel a connection, schedule your first appointment.

**4. The First Session (Intake):**

* **Intake Form:** You’ll likely be asked to fill out a detailed intake form, providing information about your background, medical history, and reasons for seeking therapy.
* **The Counselor's Role:** The counselor will likely:
    * **Build Rapport:**  They’ll focus on establishing a trusting relationship.
    * **Gather Information:** They’ll ask you questions about your history, current challenges, and goals. This is often a conversational process.
    * **Explain the Process:** They’ll explain their approach to therapy, the types of techniques they use, and what you can expect from the sessions.
    * **Set Expectations:** Discuss fees, appointment scheduling, and confidentiality.
* **Your Role:** Be open and honest (as you feel comfortable). Share your thoughts and feelings. It's okay to be nervous or unsure.

**Important Notes & Tips:**

* **Confidentiality:**  Therapists are legally and ethically bound to maintain confidentiality, with a few exceptions (e.g., if you pose a danger to yourself or others).
* **It’s Okay to Switch:** If you don't feel like it's a good fit, it’s perfectly okay to find a different counselor. Finding the right fit is crucial for successful therapy.
* **Be Patient:**  Therapy takes time and effort. Don't expect immediate results.

To help me give you even more tailored advice, could you tell me:

*   What specifically are you struggling with that’s making you consider counseling? (You don’t have to go into detail if you’re not comfortable, but a general area like anxiety, depression, relationship issues, etc., would be helpful.)",0.4141083359718323
867,"I was in a relationship with a woman for four years. We both made mistakes, but I do love her.    She has moved in with another lady. I think she is just cheating on me to make me miss her. How can I find out for sure?","Has your former partner made any efforts to be in contact with you in order to restart your relationship?From what you describe, your former partner is in a new relationship.It is possible that since you love her and would like to be together again, that you are misinterpreting your former partner's actions.If you'd like to have more certainty as to wether your former partner is cheating or whether she is happy to be with the new partner, is to contact her and ask her your question.A better road may be to accept your sad feelings that she is with someone else.Since she was meaningful to you, respect the sadness you feel and that the relationship didn't continue as you wished.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling confused, hurt, and wanting answers. It’s brave of you to acknowledge your feelings and seek guidance. Let's address this with a focus on healthy coping mechanisms and realistic expectations.

**1. Understanding Your Feelings & The Situation:**

* **It’s Okay to Feel This Way:** Seriously, it’s completely valid to feel a mix of sadness, anger, confusion, and perhaps even a desperate need for reassurance. Don't minimize your emotions. Allow yourself to grieve the relationship you thought you had.
* **Her Actions Don't Define You:** While her choices are impacting you, they don't diminish your worth or the good times you shared. Focus on moving forward with your own well-being.
* **Her Motives Are Speculation:** You're right to question her motives, but assuming she's *only* cheating to make you miss her is a leap. People are complex, and her reasons could be a combination of things – insecurity, loneliness, a genuine attraction to the other woman, or something else entirely.  Don't build your entire understanding on a single, potentially biased, assumption.

**2. What *You* Can Do (and What *Not* to Do):**

* **Communicate (Carefully):** You’ve already taken a huge step by acknowledging your feelings. You *can* talk to her, but approach it with a specific goal: to understand her perspective. Frame it like this: “I’m struggling to understand what’s happening. I value our history, and I’m trying to process this. Could you help me understand what’s driving your choices?”  **Don't** accuse, demand answers, or try to guilt her.
* **Listen More Than You Speak:** When she responds, really listen to what she says, even if it's painful. Try to understand her perspective, even if you don't agree with it.
* **Set Boundaries:** This is crucial. Regardless of what she says, establish boundaries for yourself. This might mean limiting contact, avoiding dwelling on the situation, or refusing to engage in conversations that are designed to manipulate you.
* **Don't Stalk or Obsess:** Resist the urge to track her, check her social media constantly, or try to find out details about her new relationship. This will only prolong your pain and likely damage your mental health.
* **Don’t Try to ""Win"" Her Back:**  Trying to change her mind or convince her to come back is likely to be futile and will only keep you stuck. Focus on building a life for *yourself*.

**3. Addressing Your Concerns About ""Cheating"":**

* **Define What ""Cheating"" Means to You:**  What specific behaviors would constitute cheating in your eyes? Is it physical intimacy with someone else? Is it emotional intimacy? Clarifying this can help you understand what you're perceiving as a betrayal.
* **Focus on the Pattern of Behavior:** Instead of focusing on isolated incidents, consider the overall pattern. Is she consistently prioritizing this other woman’s needs? Is she being secretive and evasive? This can provide a clearer picture.

**4. Prioritizing Your Well-being:**

* **Seek Support:** Talk to trusted friends, family members, or a therapist. Having someone to listen and offer objective support is invaluable.
* **Self-Care:** Now is the time to focus on yourself. Engage in activities you enjoy, spend time with people who make you feel good, and prioritize your physical and mental health.
* **Therapy:** A therapist can provide you with tools and strategies for coping with heartbreak, processing your emotions, and building a stronger sense of self.

139,My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.,"You should start by speaking with her about what has her so down. Have their been some significant events in her life that have affected her? Have their been significant events in your relationship that can be affecting  you both? If she just stopped drinking, she may be struggling to finding an alternative and healthier behavior. This is something the two of you can explore together. Also, if need be perhaps she can speak to a therapist to discuss her feelings about quitting alcohol. It sounds like you really care and right now she could use all the support she can get despite her pushing you away.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it’s great that you recognize the complexity and want to be supportive. It sounds like you’re navigating a really vulnerable time for your girlfriend, and wanting her to stay is a natural and important feeling. Let’s break down how you can approach this, focusing on support, understanding, and realistic expectations.

**1. Validate Her Feelings and Acknowledge the Difficulty:**

* **Listen Without Judgment:** The most important thing right now is to *really* listen to her. Let her express her feelings – the depression, the desire to move, the struggles with sobriety – without interrupting, judging, or trying to fix things immediately. Just be present and let her know you hear her.  Phrases like, ""That sounds incredibly difficult,"" or ""I can see how much pain you're in,"" can be powerful.
* **Acknowledge the Trigger:** Recognize that quitting drinking is *extremely* challenging. It’s a huge life change, and withdrawal symptoms, both physical and emotional, can be intense.  ""It makes total sense that you're feeling this way. Quitting alcohol is a massive undertaking, and it’s okay to be struggling.""
* **Validate Her Desire to Move:** Don’t dismiss her wanting to move as just another symptom of her depression.  It's a valid feeling, and it could be linked to needing a fresh start, a different environment, or a way to escape feelings of hopelessness.

**2. Supporting Her Sobriety:**

* **Be Her Support System:**  Sobriety is a team effort. Ask her what *she* needs from you to stay on track.  This might include:
    * **Accompanying her to meetings:** If she’s attending AA or another support group, offer to go with her.
    * **Reminding her of her goals:** Gently remind her of why she wanted to quit drinking.
    * **Celebrating milestones:** Acknowledge and celebrate her successes, no matter how small.
* **Understand Triggers:**  Learn about potential triggers for relapse and how to help her avoid them.
* **Don’t Enable:** This is crucial. Don’t buy her alcohol, don’t pressure her to drink, and don’t minimize the seriousness of her sobriety.

**3. Addressing the Desire to Move:**

* **Understand the ""Why"":**  Don’t just try to talk her out of moving.  You need to understand *why* she wants to leave.  Is it:
    * **Feeling trapped?**
    * **Feeling overwhelmed by her current environment?**
    * **A need for a fresh start?**
    * **Something specific about your relationship?** (Be honest with yourself about this possibility, but approach it gently.)
* **Explore Solutions Together:** Once you understand the root of her desire to move, you can start to brainstorm solutions *together*. This could involve:
    * **Making changes in your current location.**
    * **Planning a temporary move to explore options.**
    * **Addressing underlying issues in your relationship.**
* **Don’t Make it About You:** This isn't about your needs or desires. It's about supporting her in finding a way to feel safe and secure.

**4. Supporting Her Mental Health:**

* **Encourage Professional Help:**  It’s vital that she seeks professional help for her depression. Encourage her to talk to a therapist or psychiatrist.  Offer to help her find a therapist, make appointments, or even go with her to the first appointment if she’d like.
* **Be Patient:** Depression takes time to treat. There will be ups and downs.
* **Small Acts of Kindness:**  Continue to show her you care through small gestures – a hug, a thoughtful note, helping with chores, spending quality time together.

**5. Communication is Key:**

* **""I"" Statements:** When discussing difficult topics, use ""I"" statements to express your feelings without blaming her. For example, ""I feel worried when I don’t understand what’s going on,"" instead of ""You’re always shutting me out.""
* **Regular Check-Ins:**  Schedule regular times to talk about how she’s feeling and how you can best support her.

**Important Considerations:**

* **You Can’t Fix Her:** You can't force her to stay, to get better, or to make any decisions. You can only offer your support and be a consistent presence in her life.
* **Take Care of Yourself:** This is a stressful situation. Make sure you're taking care of your own mental and emotional health.  Talk to a friend, family member, or therapist if you need support.
* **Safety:** If you’re concerned about her safety (e.g., suicidal thoughts), seek professional help immediately.  The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 988.

2963,"I'm feeling rejected and frustrated. This is not new. The first month we were together, sex was about every day. Then it slowed down to once a month right away. I love my husband, but I am struggling with this.","   Feeling rejected and frustrated is a reasonable reaction to your experience with your husband. I want to encourage you that his actions may have little to do with you, and regardless of outcomes, I hope you find the help you need to process through your pain and still have hope for your marriage.   If your husband was to work with me I'd explore with him his understanding of, and experience with, intimacy in relationship with others. Furthermore, like other male clients of mine, I'd challenge your husband to secure an updated full medical exam from his PCP (primary care physician) and/or urologist in order to identify or rule out any organic issues which may be causing his apparent lack of desire for sexual intimacy. If there are no physical issues, per se, I would encourage your husband to process further his family of origin story-line regarding rules, roles, sex, and sexuality along with working through his sexual and trauma histories. ","Okay, it sounds like you're carrying a really heavy weight right now, and it’s completely understandable that you're feeling rejected and frustrated. It's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge this and talk about it – that's the first step to feeling better. Let's unpack this. What you're describing – a significant shift in intimacy, coupled with a pre-existing feeling of rejection – is a really common and complex issue in relationships.

**Let's break down what you've shared and explore some potential reasons and ways forward:**

**1. Validating Your Feelings:**

* **It’s Okay to Feel This Way:** First and foremost, what you're experiencing is *completely valid*. A change in intimacy levels, especially after a strong initial connection, can be incredibly painful and confusing. It's not ""you"" doing something wrong. It's a shift in his behavior, and you have every right to feel rejected, frustrated, and hurt.
* **Not New – Recognizing a Pattern:** You’ve rightly identified this isn’t new. This suggests there might be underlying patterns at play, and it's good that you’re recognizing that.
* **The Initial Rush & Expectations:** The rapid escalation of intimacy in the first month is often fueled by excitement, novelty, and a desire to connect deeply. It’s a natural phase, but it doesn’t necessarily translate into a sustainable long-term pattern.

**2. Understanding the Possible Reasons (It’s likely a combination):**

* **He's Processing Things Differently:** Men often process intimacy differently than women. He might need more time to feel comfortable, emotionally or physically.
* **Stress & External Factors:** Is he stressed about work, family, or other things in his life? Stress can significantly impact libido and intimacy.
* **Shifting Needs & Desires:** People's needs and desires change over time. Perhaps he's simply not feeling the same level of intense desire that he did initially.
* **Communication Issues:** There could be unspoken anxieties or concerns he's not comfortable expressing.
* **Underlying Issues:**  It’s possible there are deeper issues contributing to this, like unresolved conflict, resentment, or a lack of emotional connection.
* **He Might Be Withholding:** He could be subconsciously withdrawing due to something he’s feeling – insecurity, doubt, or perhaps something he’s struggling with internally.

**3. What You Can Do – Focusing on Your Wellbeing and Communication:**

* **Talk to Him – Carefully & Specifically:** This is crucial. Don't launch into accusations. Instead, use ""I feel"" statements to express your needs and concerns. For example: “I’ve been feeling a bit disconnected lately, and I miss the intimacy we had in the beginning. I’d really like to talk about how we can reconnect.” Or, “I’ve noticed our physical intimacy has reduced, and I’m feeling a little hurt. Can we talk about what’s going on for you?”
* **Ask Open-Ended Questions:** Encourage him to talk about *his* feelings. ""What's been on your mind lately?"" “How are you feeling about our relationship?” ""Is there anything you'd like to talk about that's making you feel distant?""
* **Focus on Connection, Not Just Sex:** Intimacy isn't just about sex.  Spend quality time together, engage in activities you both enjoy, and prioritize emotional connection.
* **Take Care of Yourself:** This is *essential*. Don’t let this rejection define you. Focus on your own happiness, hobbies, and friendships. A strong sense of self will make you more resilient.
* **Consider Couples Counseling:** If you're struggling to communicate effectively or if there are deeper issues at play, couples counseling can provide a safe space to work through these challenges with a trained professional.

**Important Note:**  It’s important to recognize that you can’t *make* him change. You can only communicate your needs and be clear about what you need from the relationship.

712,"My daughter didn't see her biological father for the last three years. She doesn’t want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse. The visitation is with supervision, but she refuses to see him. Is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy?","Hi Dillon,I'm from Canada, so I don't know the laws in your state. It depends on that a good deal, perhaps. In my opinion, a child should never be forced into a situation where they feel unsafe, even if it is ""supervised"". If the child is old enough to make a strong statement about not wanting to see a parent, then this should be honoured. Unfortunately, the laws don't always uphold a parent's right to do what is best for their child. I recommend you see a lawyer, who will advise you about how to proceed without putting yourself at risk of breaching custody agreements.If you feel your daughter can benefit from therapy, that is a separate question. Or is she already in therapy? A family therapist will typically meet with you alone first, in order to determine if therapy is a wise move for your child. It isn't always appropriate.","Okay, this is a really complex and sensitive situation, and it’s fantastic that you’re prioritizing your daughter’s safety and well-being. Let's break down the considerations and explore the best approach.

**1. Your Daughter’s Safety and Trauma:**

* **Her Feelings Are Paramount:** The fact that she refuses to see him after remembering traumatic experiences is a *huge* red flag. Her feelings are absolutely valid and should be the primary driver of your decisions. Forcing her into a situation she’s clearly terrified of will likely be incredibly damaging to her mental health.
* **Domestic Violence & Child Abuse:** The history of domestic violence and child abuse is profoundly concerning. This isn’t just a disagreement; it’s a serious risk factor for long-term psychological harm. 
* **Trauma Responses:**  People who have experienced trauma often develop strong, instinctive avoidance behaviors. Her refusal to see him is a very common and natural response.

**2. Therapy is Absolutely Crucial:**

* **Processing Trauma:** Therapy is *essential* for your daughter to process the trauma she experienced.  A skilled therapist specializing in trauma (specifically childhood trauma) can help her:
    * Understand the impact of the abuse.
    * Develop coping mechanisms.
    * Build self-esteem and resilience.
    * Address any distorted beliefs she may have about herself and others.
* **Safety Planning:**  Therapy can also help her develop a safety plan – strategies for dealing with difficult emotions, triggers, and potentially manipulative or abusive individuals.
* **Decision-Making Support:**  A therapist can provide a neutral space for your daughter to explore her feelings about her father and to make informed decisions about contact, if any, based on what’s in her best interest.

**3. Regarding Visitation with Supervision:**

* **Supervision is Necessary, But Not a Solution:** Supervision is a protective measure, but it doesn’t address the underlying issues. It's a band-aid, not a cure. The goal of supervision isn’t to force contact, but to ensure her safety during any interaction.
* **The Court’s Role:**  The court order for supervised visitation is based on the risk assessment. The court is trying to balance the child’s right to know their father with the need to protect her from harm.

**4. About Trying to See Him After Therapy – This is Where It Gets Delicate:**

* **Don’t Initiate Contact:**  *Do not* attempt to arrange a visit with her father after she’s been in therapy.  This is likely to be incredibly confusing and destabilizing for her.
* **Therapist-Led Exploration:** The *only* way this should be approached is if the therapist *specifically* believes, after a thorough assessment, that it’s safe and beneficial for your daughter to cautiously explore contact. This is a rare circumstance and should only happen with extreme caution and a clear plan.
* **Her Agency is Key:**  Ultimately, the decision about contact should remain with your daughter, guided by the therapist.

**5. What to Do Now:**

1. **Prioritize Therapy:**  Ensure your daughter is in ongoing therapy with a qualified trauma therapist. This is the most important step.
2. **Communicate with the Therapist:**  Keep the therapist fully informed about your daughter’s feelings, concerns, and any changes you observe.
3. **Work with the Court:**  Maintain open communication with the court regarding your daughter’s situation and the therapist’s recommendations.
4. **Support Your Daughter:**  Provide her with unconditional love and support. Validate her feelings and reassure her that you’re there for her.

1612,"I have had a crush on this guy for years. I last talked to him a few years ago when we graduated from high school. We left off on a good note. Should I message him and see how he is doing, or is it too late?","You'll only find out whether or not it is ""too late"", by following through with wanting to message him.Regardless of whether the response you receive is what you'd hoped to hear, including not hearing back from him, you will have done yourself a great honor and respect by following through on a wish and curiosity you've had for some time.","Okay, this is a classic and totally understandable situation! It's great that you've been thinking about this for years. Let's break down whether you should message him and what to consider.

**It's *absolutely* not too late to reach out.** Seriously. People's lives change, and reconnecting can be wonderful, regardless of how long it's been. The fact that you’ve held onto this crush for years shows it wasn't just a fleeting thing – that's a really positive sign.

**Here's a breakdown of things to consider and how to approach it:**

**1. Why You Want to Reach Out:**

* **Be honest with yourself:** Why do you want to reconnect *now*? Is it purely because you still have feelings? Is it because you’ve been thinking about him lately? Or are there other reasons (like wanting to reminisce about old times)? Understanding your motivation will help you frame the message.
* **Manage Expectations:**  Don’t go into this expecting a whirlwind romance. Be realistic. He might be completely different than you remember, he might not be interested in rekindling anything, or he might be in a completely different place in his life.  Go in with the understanding that you're opening a door for a possible connection, but you need to be okay with whatever the outcome.


**2. Crafting the Message – Keep it Low-Pressure & Friendly:**

* **Start Casual:** Don’t launch into a declaration of love. A simple, friendly message is key. Here are some options:
    * “Hey [His Name], it’s [Your Name]! It feels a little random, but I was just thinking about our graduation and wanted to see how you’re doing.”
    * “Hey [His Name], long time no talk! I was just reminiscing about our time in high school and wanted to see what you've been up to.”
    * “Hi [His Name], hope you’re doing well! It’s [Your Name] – I was just remembering [mention a specific shared memory - something positive and lighthearted].”
* **Acknowledge the Time:** Briefly acknowledge the years that have passed. This shows you're aware of the gap.
* **Ask an Open-Ended Question:** Encourage a response. “How have you been?” or “What have you been up to lately?”
* **Keep it Short:** Don’t write a novel. A few sentences is plenty.

**Example of a good message:**

“Hey [His Name], it’s [Your Name]! It feels a little random, but I was just thinking about our graduation and wanted to see how you’re doing. I’d love to hear what you’ve been up to these days.”

**3. What to Do After You Send It:**

* **Don’t Over-Analyze:** Resist the urge to constantly check your phone and obsess over his response (or lack thereof).
* **Respect His Response (or Lack Thereof):** If he responds warmly and seems interested in continuing the conversation, great! If he gives a short, polite response and doesn’t initiate further contact, respect that. It might be a sign he's not interested, or he's just busy.
* **Don't Take it Personally:**  People’s lives change, and sometimes connections fade. It’s not necessarily about you.

**Important Note:**  Be prepared for the possibility that he might not respond at all. That’s okay.  It doesn't diminish your feelings, and it's better than putting yourself in a position of wondering ""what if?"".

**To help me give you even more tailored advice, could you tell me:**

*   **What was your dynamic like in high school?** (Were you close friends, just acquaintances, or did you have a specific type of connection?)
*   **What’s your biggest hope for reaching out?** (e.g., rekindling a romantic connection, just catching up, reminiscing?)",0.5302894115447998
1423,"My parents seem okay with other sexualities, but normally they only talk about being gay. When they do talk about bisexuality, they say things like “they'll do anything” or things that make me very uncomfortable because I am bisexual. I don't know if I am ready to come out to them.","Perhaps you are not ready to come out to your parents.  Often times our readiness is not dependent on what others' will say or how they react. But more so dependent on how emotionally prepared we are to deal with others' reactions.  It may be beneficial for you to play out each possible scenario and conclusion (eg. your parents being supportive vs. your parents being disappointed and so on). How are you prepared to deal with the outcome?  You may also seek help through counselors, support groups and/or individuals you know that have dealt with similar situations to help you prepare to discuss this with your parents.  All the best!","Okay, this is a really important and understandably difficult situation. It’s fantastic that you’re recognizing the discomfort you feel and wanting to navigate this carefully. It’s completely valid to feel hesitant and unsure when you sense your parents’ views are shifting, but also carrying a potential undercurrent of judgment. Let’s break this down and talk about how you can approach this.

**1. Understanding Their Perspective (Without Accepting It)**

* **Their Limited Knowledge:** It’s possible they're simply operating from a very narrow understanding of bisexuality. The stereotypes you’ve encountered (“they’ll do anything”) are damaging and inaccurate. Many bisexual people are incredibly grounded, responsible, and committed to ethical relationships. Their comments likely reflect misinformation they've absorbed.
* **Fear and Concern:** Sometimes, parents react with fear, even if they don't consciously realize it. They might be worried about your safety, your social acceptance, or their own reputation. This doesn't excuse their comments, but it can offer some context.
* **Habit and Familiarity:** It's also possible they’ve just defaulted to talking about gay relationships because that's what they’re most comfortable with. It’s a pattern they’ve fallen into.

**2. Your Feelings Are Valid**

* **Your Discomfort is Key:** The fact that their comments make *you* incredibly uncomfortable is a huge signal. Your feelings matter. You don't owe anyone your happiness, and you shouldn't feel pressured to share something that makes you feel unsafe or judged.
* **You Are Valid:** Being bisexual is perfectly valid. Your sexuality is a part of who you are, and you deserve to be accepted and loved for it.

**3. Assessing Your Readiness to Come Out**

This is the crucial part, and there's no right or wrong answer. Here’s a framework to help you decide:

* **Safety First:** This is *paramount*. Before anything else, honestly assess your parents' potential reactions. Have they shown open-mindedness in the past? Are they generally accepting of differences? If you have any reason to believe they might react negatively, severely, or try to change you, *do not* come out to them yet.
* **Level of Support:** Do you have other supportive people in your life – friends, other family members, a therapist – who you can lean on, regardless of your parents' reaction?
* **Your Own Readiness:** Are you emotionally prepared for a potentially difficult conversation? Do you have a clear idea of what you want to say?

**4. What You Can Do Now (Without a Full Coming Out)**

* **Start Small Conversations:** You can begin to gently introduce more inclusive language. For example, if they say ""they'll do anything,"" you could respond with, ""Actually, bisexuality is a very diverse experience. People in bisexual relationships have all sorts of values and commitments."" This subtly challenges their assumptions.
* **Share General Information:** If they're curious, you could share resources about bisexuality – articles, websites, or even just talking about a positive bisexual role model. This can help them understand the reality of the experience.
* **Focus on Your Feelings (Without Explaining Your Sexuality):** You can talk about your feelings of self-acceptance and happiness.  ""I'm really happy and confident in who I am,"" or “I'm really grateful for the support I have in my life.” This can create a more positive atmosphere.
* **Set Boundaries:** If they make uncomfortable comments again, you can politely but firmly say, “I’m not comfortable talking about that,” or “I’d appreciate it if you didn’t make assumptions about my relationships.”

**5. Seeking Support**

* **Talk to a Therapist:** A therapist specializing in LGBTQ+ issues can provide invaluable support and guidance. They can help you process your feelings, develop coping strategies, and navigate conversations with your parents.
* **LGBTQ+ Organizations:** Organizations like The Trevor Project, PFLAG, and GLAAD offer resources and support for LGBTQ+ individuals and their families.
* **Trusted Friends:** Lean on friends who understand and accept you.

**Important Note:** You don't have to rush into anything. It's okay to take your time and prioritize your safety and well-being.

3336,"I've been going through a rough time lately. I been into nothing but women. I’ve never thought about men until a week ago. I’m very upset and depressed about this. It's not normal to me. I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that I’m not gay. I get the same results each time, and I feel disgust. This is tough on me. I'm scared that I looked too many times. I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.","Hello. Coming to terms with the idea that you might be of a sexuality other than the one in which you were socially raised to be, can be emotionally disturbing, and quite unsettling. It creates anxiety, maybe even panic, and leaves us feeling confused and uncertain about our own sense of identity. It becomes important to first ask yourself how you feel when you are thinking of being intimate with guys, or if you desire them to be intimate with you. It is important to know what impact this has on you, because it can determine your level of follow through and desire in pursuing sexual activity with someone of the same sex. I am not going to pass judgment on you either way - even for having the thoughts. I have worked with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) community in various ways over the years. Many I speak to, say they had to struggle to come to terms with this awareness about how they see themselves sexually. Maybe you are bisexual, and don't have an exclusive attraction to the same sex. You might consider doing some searches online for community support groups in your area, to explore the feelings and issues around this topic. Talking to someone who you trust can be helpful too. Running from your feelings is not a good idea, and others in a support group for sexuality issues, might be able to relate to you and what you're going through right now. This will offer you perspective, as you think on how this plays out in your life.Counselors are typically well trained to provide clinical services to clients who are experiencing feelings and thoughts much like the ones you are having now. I encourage you to consider reaching out for help. You are not crazy or insane for thinking of working with a counselor, nor of having feelings of same sex attraction. If you decide you are indeed gay, then know that you are not alone and never will be alone in that feeling. There is a huge community of support for you. Additionally, we all need help sometimes dealing with all sort of issues. A counselor can work more in depth with you to examine the motivations behind the feelings, and help you come to terms with them more directly. I hope that you come to a place where you feel less alone and more secure with yourself as you examine this area of your life. No matter what, do not fear being yourself. Again...you are not alone, I promise.Warm regards,Shawn Berthel, M.S., LMHC","Okay, thank you for sharing this with me. It takes a lot of courage to talk about feelings like these, and I want you to know that you're not alone. What you're experiencing sounds incredibly distressing and confusing, and it's completely understandable why you're feeling so upset, depressed, and scared. Let’s break this down and address each part of what you’ve described.

**1. The Shift in Attraction:**

It’s incredibly common for people's attractions to shift and evolve over time. Sexuality isn’t always a fixed thing. It can be influenced by a huge number of factors – experiences, emotions, relationships, and even just a change in perspective. The fact that you’ve spent a significant amount of time focused on women and then suddenly find yourself experiencing attraction to women is not necessarily a sign of something ""wrong"" with you. It’s a complex and potentially beautiful part of figuring out who you are.  Don't beat yourself up about it.

**2. The Porn Consumption and Disgust:**

The fact that you've been looking at gay porn, and then feeling disgust afterward, is a really important part of this. This suggests a strong, perhaps even overwhelming, reaction to these feelings. This reaction itself is understandable. When we encounter something that challenges our deeply held beliefs or feelings about ourselves, it can trigger a powerful emotional response. The disgust you're feeling is likely a defense mechanism – a way of trying to protect yourself from a feeling that feels very foreign and potentially destabilizing. It doesn't automatically mean you *are* gay, but it does highlight the intensity of the emotions involved.

**3. The Shaking and Anxiety:**

The physical symptoms you're describing – the shaking and anxiety – are completely valid responses to the level of distress you're feeling. Your body is reacting to a significant internal conflict. It's important to acknowledge and validate these physical sensations.

**4. It's Not ""Normal"" to Feel This Way - And That's Okay:**

You said, ""It's not normal to me.""  That's a perfectly valid feeling. There's no single ""normal"" when it comes to attraction and sexuality. What feels natural and comfortable for one person might be completely different for another. The fact that this feels unusual for you doesn't make it wrong or bad.

**What You Can Do Now:**

* **Talk to Someone You Trust:** Sharing what you’re going through with a trusted friend, family member, or mentor can provide support and perspective.
* **Consider Therapy:** This is *highly* recommended. A therapist, especially one specializing in sexuality or LGBTQ+ issues, can provide a safe and non-judgmental space for you to explore these feelings. They can help you understand the underlying reasons for this shift, develop coping strategies, and work through the anxiety and shame you’re experiencing.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) are often helpful in situations like this.
* **Challenge Negative Thoughts:** You mentioned thinking about it and shaking.  Try to gently challenge these thoughts. Are they based on facts, or are they fueled by fear and anxiety?
* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself. You're navigating a confusing and potentially frightening experience. Treat yourself with the same compassion you would offer a friend going through something similar.
* **Focus on What You *Do* Feel:** Instead of focusing on the ""what ifs,"" try to gently explore what you *are* feeling – even if it’s just confusion or uncertainty.

2484,"I have known her for years. She was dating my brother-in-law when we met. My kids think of her as their aunt. On Halloween 2014, I lost my mom to cancer. My mom and dad were still married when she passed away. My friend was there for me through that and my own cancer diagnosis. She has been a very big part of both me and my kids’ life, but now last month, my dad told me that he really likes my friend and wants to marry her. She’s like a sister to me. My kids hate the idea.","How are you measuring whether or not your dad understands your wish?Your dad understanding your wish does not mean he will necessarily follow through with what you want.Based on what you describe about your relationship to the woman in question, your discomfort with the idea of your dad marrying your friend, is reasonable.Have the conversation with your dad that includes your viewpoint, and also ask him for his impression of your feelings.Its even possible he already has considered your feelings and hasn't yet told you.It is also possible that a conversation on the subject, as well as your dad following through with his decision to marry your best friend, may develop in a very positive way.Part of the current uneasiness you feel may be from fear of how a change in circumstances and introducing new relationship dynamics might feel.Given that the person who died was your mom, maybe your emotions are not yet ready seeing your dad with a replacement spouse. Try to see the situation from the point of everyone, including yourself, who is involved in this major change.  Maybe having a family discussion about acceptance and readiness to accept a new partner for your dad, would open new empathy for all of these family members.","Okay, wow. This is a *lot* to process, and it sounds like you’re carrying a huge weight of emotions right now. It's completely understandable that you're feeling conflicted, upset, and likely a whole mix of other things. Let’s break this down and explore what you're feeling and what you can do.

**Understanding Your Feelings:**

* **Loss of Control:** You're feeling like someone is making a huge decision that drastically impacts your life and the lives of your children. The fact that your dad is pursuing this relationship after your mom's death is deeply upsetting.
* **Betrayal:** It’s natural to feel betrayed, even if you understand your dad’s grief. He’s replacing a significant part of your life – your mom – with someone who was a close friend and sister.
* **Protecting Your Children:** You're fiercely protective of your kids and their established relationship with this person they see as family. You're understandably concerned about how this change will affect them.
* **Grief & Remembrance:** Your mom's death is still very raw, and this situation is forcing you to revisit those feelings of loss and grief.
* **Disrespect for Your Mom's Memory:** It's incredibly painful to see someone who was a close friend of your mom now pursuing a relationship with her husband.

**Let’s address the key points:**

* **Your Dad's Grief:** Your dad is undoubtedly grieving the loss of your mom. Grief manifests in different ways, and it sounds like this is his way of trying to fill a void. However, this doesn't justify moving forward with a relationship that you and your children strongly oppose.
* **Your Kids’ Perspective:** It’s crucial to validate their feelings. They've built a connection with this person, and it's completely reasonable for them to be upset.  Don’t dismiss their feelings – acknowledge that they are feeling loss and uncertainty.
* **The ""Sister"" Dynamic:** The fact that she’s like a sister to you is a powerful connection, and it adds another layer of complexity to the situation. It's okay to feel protective of that bond.

**What You Can Do:**

1. **Talk to Your Dad – Calmly and Firmly:** You need to have a direct, honest conversation with your dad. Express how deeply hurt and upset you are. Use “I” statements to avoid blaming: ""Dad, I’m incredibly saddened and worried about this. I feel like you’re trying to replace Mom, and it’s causing a lot of distress for me and the kids.""  Clearly state your boundaries: “I need you to understand that this is not something we’re comfortable with, and I need you to respect our feelings.”

2. **Talk to Your Kids:** Acknowledge their feelings and reassure them that you love them and will always be there for them. Let them know you understand they’re feeling confused and sad.  You could say something like, “I know this is a big change, and it’s okay to feel however you’re feeling. We’ll get through this together.”

3. **Talk to Your Friend:**  It might be helpful to have a conversation with her.  Explain how this situation is making you and your family feel.  She likely wants what’s best for you and your children, and she can be a valuable ally in navigating this.

4. **Don't Get Drawn Into an Argument:** It's easy to get pulled into heated arguments. Try to remain calm and focused on expressing your needs and boundaries.

5. **Seek Support:**  Talk to a therapist, counselor, or trusted friend.  Processing this complex situation can be emotionally draining, and having a professional or supportive person to talk to can be invaluable.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Your Dad’s Capacity:**  Assess your dad’s ability to make rational decisions. Is he struggling with grief? Is he seeking validation? Understanding the root of his behavior can help you approach the situation with more empathy (while still maintaining your boundaries).
* **Long-Term Impact:** Think about the potential long-term impact of this relationship on your family.

**This is a challenging situation, and there’s no easy answer.  Prioritize your well-being and the well-being of your children.  Be firm in your boundaries, and seek support when you need it.**

To help me understand your situation better and offer more tailored advice, could you tell me:

*   What is your dad's age and general state of mental health?
*   How old are your children?
*   What is your dad’s relationship with your friend? (e.g., have they known each other for a long time?)",0.5010072588920593
2587,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year and a half. He loves me a lot, and I love him. It hurts to be apart from him for so long. It hurts all over, and then I feel like it won't last.",I would suggest that you look up the word codependency and it's characteristics.  See if you relate to those characteristics.  I have a feeling  you have suffered some form of loss in your life that you have not dealt with properly.  For some reason you are depending on your boyfriend to fill that loss.  Considering working with a counseling to work through your emotions and resolve any lingering issues.,"Okay, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time. That kind of ache, both physically and emotionally, when you're separated from someone you deeply care about, is incredibly painful. It’s completely understandable that you're feeling this way after a year and a half – that's a significant amount of time to build a connection and feel that deep bond. And the feeling that it ""won't last"" just adds another layer of anxiety and sadness.

Let’s break down what you're describing and explore some ways to cope:

**1. Validating Your Feelings:**

* **It’s Okay to Feel This Way:** First and foremost, please know that your feelings are *completely* valid. There's no ""should"" about how you're feeling. The intensity you're describing – “it hurts all over” – suggests this isn't just a little sadness. It’s a real, physical manifestation of your emotional distress. Don’t minimize it or tell yourself you shouldn’t be feeling so strongly.
* **The Fear of Loss is Powerful:** The feeling that it “won’t last” is a common one, especially when you’ve invested so much time and emotion into a relationship. It's fueled by fear – fear of change, fear of disappointment, fear of the unknown. Recognizing this fear is the first step to managing it.

**2. Understanding the Pain:**

* **Attachment & Investment:** You've built a strong attachment to him. That means your brain releases chemicals (like oxytocin) that create a sense of comfort and security when you're near him. When you're apart, those levels drop, and you feel the emptiness.
* **The ""What Ifs"":** The fear of it not lasting often leads to “what if” thinking – “What if we grow apart?” “What if something happens?” These thoughts can be incredibly distressing.

**3. What You Can Do to Cope:**

* **Acknowledge and Allow Yourself to Feel:** Don’t try to suppress the sadness, anxiety, or hurt. Allow yourself to cry, to feel the emotions fully. Bottling them up will only make them stronger in the long run.
* **Talk About It:** Talking to someone you trust – a friend, family member, or therapist – can make a huge difference. Just verbalizing your feelings can help you process them.
* **Focus on the Good:** While it’s important to acknowledge the pain, try to consciously focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the love you share. Remind yourself why you care for him so deeply.
* **Grounding Techniques:** When you’re feeling overwhelmed, try grounding techniques to bring yourself back to the present moment. This could include:
    * **Deep Breathing:** Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system.
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
* **Engage in Activities You Enjoy:** Distract yourself with things that bring you joy and help you relax.
* **Communicate with Your Boyfriend:**  If you feel comfortable, talking to him about how you're feeling might help. Just letting him know you're struggling with the distance can strengthen your connection.  (However, don't burden him with your anxieties if he's not equipped to handle them).

**4. Addressing the ""Won't Last"" Fear:**

* **Recognize It’s a Thought, Not a Fact:**  Remind yourself that this is a *fear*, not a certainty.  It's a thought you're having, and thoughts aren't always true.
* **Focus on the Present:** Instead of worrying about the future, concentrate on enjoying the time you *do* have together.
* **Work on Your Relationship:**  If you're both committed, focus on nurturing your relationship – spending quality time together, communicating openly, and working through challenges.

**Important Note:** If you're experiencing persistent feelings of sadness, anxiety, or hopelessness, it’s important to seek professional help. A therapist can provide you with tools and strategies to cope with your emotions and address any underlying issues.

3229,Does counseling really do anything that can help people?,Counseling can go a long way in improving your mental health. Counseling helps you to get new perspective on your life and problems.Talking about your problems with a counselor gives them substances and something to get a handle on. Talking about your problems gives you a chance look at your situation from a new angle to help solve your problems.The counselor is a neutral listener that can help give direction and answers to your needs.Counseling can help you solve your problems but also can set up a plan for the future. Counseling can help you to deal with things before they get out of hand.Give counseling a try.,"Okay, let's tackle this really important question: Does counseling really do anything that can help people? The short answer is **yes, research consistently shows that counseling can be incredibly effective for a wide range of issues.** However, it's a nuanced answer, and it's important to understand *how* and *why* it works.

Here's a breakdown of what we know, broken down into key areas:

**1. Research Supports Effectiveness:**

* **Meta-Analyses:** These are studies that combine the results of many smaller studies.  Numerous meta-analyses on various types of counseling (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, psychodynamic therapy, humanistic therapy) have found significant positive effects. For example, CBT is consistently shown to be effective for anxiety, depression, and PTSD.
* **Effect Sizes:**  Even when looking at individual studies, the effect sizes (a measure of the strength of the effect) are often moderate to large. This means that counseling isn’t just a little bit helpful; it can make a substantial difference in people’s lives.
* **Specific Disorders:** Counseling is particularly well-established as an effective treatment for:
    * **Anxiety Disorders:** Generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder, phobias.
    * **Depression:**  CBT and interpersonal therapy are frequently used and have strong evidence bases.
    * **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):**  CBT-informed therapies are considered the gold standard.
    * **Substance Use Disorders:** Counseling, often combined with medication, is a vital part of recovery.
    * **Relationship Problems:** Couples and family therapy can help improve communication and resolve conflicts.

**2. How Counseling Works – The Mechanisms of Change:**

It's not just about ""talking"" about your problems. Counseling creates change through several interconnected processes:

* **Cognitive Restructuring (CBT):**  Identifying and challenging negative thought patterns to change how you think and behave.
* **Behavioral Changes:** Learning new coping skills, facing fears, and changing maladaptive behaviors.
* **Emotional Processing:**  Providing a safe space to explore and understand difficult emotions.
* **Increased Self-Awareness:**  Helping you gain a deeper understanding of your thoughts, feelings, and motivations.
* **Developing Coping Skills:** Learning strategies for managing stress, anxiety, and other challenges.
* **Building Support:**  Establishing a trusting relationship with a therapist can provide a vital source of support and encouragement.
* **Schema Therapy:** Addresses deeply rooted, often unconscious patterns of thinking and feeling that developed in childhood.

**3. Different Types of Counseling & Their Approaches:**

It’s important to recognize that “counseling” is a broad term. Different approaches exist:

* **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Focuses on thoughts and behaviors.
* **Psychodynamic Therapy:** Explores unconscious patterns and past experiences.
* **Humanistic Therapy (e.g., Person-Centered Therapy):**  Emphasizes self-acceptance and personal growth.
* **Solution-Focused Therapy:**  Concentrates on identifying solutions and future goals.
* **Family Systems Therapy:**  Views problems within the context of family relationships.

**4. Important Considerations:**

* **Therapist-Client Relationship is Key:** The quality of the relationship with your therapist is arguably the *most* important factor in successful therapy.
* **Not a Quick Fix:**  Therapy takes time and effort. It’s not a magic bullet.
* **Not for Everyone:**  Counseling isn't appropriate for everyone, and it’s important to find a therapist who is a good fit for your needs and personality.
* **Effectiveness Varies:**  While research shows overall effectiveness, the degree of benefit can vary depending on the individual, the problem, and the type of therapy.

Do you want me to delve deeper into a specific aspect of this topic, such as:

414,"I just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. My family and I really need this job.
   People keep telling me I have ""anxiety"" and I'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. This is all new to me. What can I do?","Hi, It is really good that you are working so hard to take care of your family. Anxiety can be so challenging, especially when new challenges have come up. It would be good to work through some of these issues you are experiencing, and examine your self care and support processes.","Okay, this is a really understandable and valid fear. It’s fantastic that you’re recognizing this anxiety and wanting to address it proactively. It's also great that you're acknowledging this is new to you – that gives you a starting point for understanding and managing it. Let’s break this down and create a plan.

**1. Understanding Your Anxiety & Validation:**

* **It's Okay to Feel This Way:** Seriously, it's completely normal to feel anxious about a huge change like this, especially when it involves travel and potentially being alone. The fact that people are labeling it ""anxiety"" doesn't diminish your legitimate feelings.
* **What Does Your Anxiety Feel Like?**  Try to pinpoint the physical sensations you experience when you think about this trip. Do you get a racing heart, shortness of breath, muscle tension, dizziness, nausea, or a feeling of impending doom? Recognizing these early signs is crucial.
* **Distinguish Between Normal Worry and Anxiety:** Worry is a natural response to uncertainty. Anxiety is often characterized by intense, persistent worry that feels disproportionate to the situation and can significantly interfere with your daily life.

**2. Practical Strategies for Managing Anxiety on the Road:**

* **Preparation is Key:** The more prepared you are, the less anxious you’ll likely feel.
    * **Detailed Itinerary:** A solid itinerary reduces uncertainty. Know your routes, accommodation, and planned activities.
    * **Packing Essentials:** Pack items that comfort you – a favorite blanket, photos of family, calming scents (lavender, chamomile), earplugs, eye mask.
    * **Emergency Kit:** Include anything you might need – medication, snacks, water, a small first-aid kit.
* **Relaxation Techniques:** Practice these *before* you leave, and then incorporate them into your routine on the road.
    * **Deep Breathing:** Box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4) is incredibly effective.  Do this when you feel your anxiety rising.
    * **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** Tense and release different muscle groups in your body.
    * **Mindfulness Meditation:** Focus on the present moment – your senses.
    * **Visualization:**  Imagine yourself successfully navigating the trip, feeling calm and confident.
* **Create a Routine:**  Routines provide a sense of control.  Establish regular sleep, meal, and activity times.
* **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol:** These can exacerbate anxiety symptoms.
* **Stay Connected (But Strategically):**  Talk to your family regularly, but don’t overdo it if it’s fueling your anxiety. Schedule specific times to connect.
* **Distraction Techniques:** When anxiety hits, engage in something that occupies your mind – reading, listening to music, puzzles, or talking to someone.

**3. Addressing the ""Labeling"" – How to Respond to Others:**

* **You Don't Need a Diagnosis (Yet):**  People saying ""you have anxiety"" can be unhelpful and even stigmatizing. You don’t need a formal diagnosis to experience anxiety.
* **Set Boundaries:** It’s okay to politely deflect. You could say something like: “I’m feeling a little anxious about the trip, and I’m working on managing it.”  Or, ""I appreciate your concern, but I’m taking steps to handle this.""
* **Educate (If You Want):** If someone is genuinely trying to be supportive, you can briefly explain that you’re experiencing normal travel anxiety and are taking steps to cope.

**4. Seeking Support:**

* **Talk to Your Family:** Share your anxieties with your family. They can offer support and understanding.
* **Therapist/Counselor:** If your anxiety is significantly impacting your life, consider talking to a therapist. They can provide you with coping strategies and support. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is often very effective for anxiety.
* **Employee Assistance Program (EAP):**  Check if your new job offers an EAP. These programs often provide free counseling services.

**Important Note:** If you experience a full-blown panic attack – characterized by intense fear, difficulty breathing, chest pain, or feeling like you’re going to die – seek immediate medical attention.

3387,"I'm in my late teens and live with my dad.  The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I won't want to talk to them for days or even weeks. 

Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.

Are they right, am I depressed?","Hello. Being a teenager in our society today can cause depression quite easily. We look at the world in which we live, and the doubts we have about being able to make a contribution, or to have value and worth with the people around us, and we begin to internalize those messages of self-worth. If that alone were not enough, you are trying to figure out where you want to go in life, and who you are supposed to be in the world. Teens are faced with pressures of being judged by your peers for how you present yourself; following current fashions; possessing the trendy things; and hanging out with the ""in crowd."" Here's a ""secret"" that might help with most of those issues: Not much of those problems I've just described will really matter as they might seem to right now, in the real world. If you are feeling depression because you feel you lack some of those things that are seen as important by others (like your peers), I can assure you that being someone who is kind; compassionate; understanding of another person's suffering; and the effort you make to be the best person you can become in the world, will far outweigh anything you experienced in your teen years.When we are young, we judge everything based on what our peers have, what they say, the way they dress, who's popular, who's not popular, and for the most of it, all of that is external. So the question becomes, are you trying to fix the feelings on the inside (the internal stuff), with the trappings of all the stuff on the outside (the internal)? That is to say, do you feel that if you had what your friends have, you would be happy and less depressed? Depression is usually a symptom of something much bigger, it is not typically a problem by itself (just as a person who experiences a high temperature may likely have a cold). So fixing the symptom requires looking at the possible causes. In your post, you mentioned that you live with your dad. Are your parents divorced or separated, or has your mom passed away? Either of these circumstances could certainly cause depression. Finding out when you started feeling depressed, might be able to pinpoint the trigger that caused it, which requires looking at when you last felt really happy. It is also important to keep in mind, that as a teenager, your emotions are often being experienced very randomly, and sometimes without cause. It is part of your emotional development, but as you grow older can learn how to manage those emotions better and practice doing things that help you feel better (without causing harm to yourself).Have you tried talking to your dad about your feelings, or maybe another relative if you feel safer doing so? Do you have a friend who is your best friend...someone who is there for you no matter what? If not, there is a service you can use that is a national number for teens to talk with teen peer counselors. They are teens like yourself, but they have some insights that might be helpful. Its called Teen Line (https://teenlineonline.org/). It helped me when I was in my teens, and has helped lots of other teens as well. You might find a place to get some referrals to other local services in your area. If you want are in Washington state and would like to connect with me directly, you call link to me via my profile page. Or perhaps finding a counselor in your local area might be useful. Most towns and cities have some form of low cost counseling. You might also check with your school for assistance.Don't be afraid of not always knowing how you are supposed to feel. Adults don't always have a handle on it either. Being a teenager carries a lot stress, fear, and uncertainty. But you are not alone, and there is help if you reach out for it. I wish for you the very best, and bright future. ","Okay, let's unpack this. It sounds like you're going through a really tough time, and it's incredibly brave of you to recognize it and reach out. What you're describing – the fluctuating desire to connect with friends, the negative self-talk, and the feeling of not being ""worth it"" – are all common experiences, especially during the transition to adulthood and college. Let's address each part and then talk about whether you might be experiencing depression.

**1. Fluctuating Social Engagement:**

* **It's Normal to Have Waves:** It's *completely* normal to have periods of wanting to connect and periods of wanting to withdraw. This is especially true when you’re in college - it’s a huge adjustment with new people, new pressures, and new expectations.  Some days you'll feel energized and social; other days you'll need space and solitude.  Don’t beat yourself up for wanting to isolate sometimes.
* **College is Intense:** College is a pressure cooker.  You're juggling academics, social life, figuring out your identity, and potentially dealing with financial stress. It’s okay to need downtime to recharge.
* **It Doesn’t Mean You’re Not Worthy:**  The fact that you *want* to connect with your friends is a really important point. The fact that you sometimes pull back doesn't mean you’re not worthy of friendship or that something is wrong with you. 


**2. Negative Self-Talk (""I'm not worth knowing or I'm never going to do anything right""):**

* **These are Common Thought Patterns:** The thoughts you're having – feeling like you're not worth knowing or that you’ll always mess up – are often signs of negative self-talk, which is a very common experience, especially in your late teens and early twenties. These thoughts can be fueled by perfectionism, anxiety, and feeling overwhelmed.
* **Challenge Your Thoughts:** When you catch yourself thinking these things, try to gently challenge them. Ask yourself: ""Is this thought actually true? Is there evidence to support it? Or am I being overly critical of myself?""  Often, these thoughts are based on assumptions rather than facts.

**3. Are You Depressed?**

It's important to acknowledge that what you're describing *could* be symptoms of depression. Here’s why:

* **Depression Often Manifests as Social Withdrawal:** A key symptom of depression is a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy, and often this includes social activities.
* **Negative Self-Talk is a Strong Indicator:** Persistent negative thoughts about yourself are a very common symptom of depression.
* **Other Symptoms to Consider:**  Depression can also involve:
    * Persistent sadness or hopelessness
    * Changes in appetite or sleep patterns
    * Fatigue or loss of energy
    * Difficulty concentrating
    * Feelings of guilt or worthlessness

**What You Should Do Now:**

1. **Talk to Someone You Trust:** This is the *most* important step. Talk to your dad, a trusted teacher, a school counselor, a therapist, or a close friend.  Just talking about how you're feeling can make a huge difference.

2. **Reach Out for Professional Help:**  A therapist can help you explore the root of these feelings, develop coping mechanisms, and challenge negative thought patterns.  Many colleges offer free or low-cost counseling services.  You can also talk to your family doctor.

3. **Self-Care:**  Focus on taking care of yourself:
   * **Get enough sleep.**
   * **Eat healthy foods.**
   * **Exercise regularly.** (Even a short walk can help.)
   * **Do things you enjoy, even if you don't feel like it.** (Start small.)

76,I’m facing severe depression and anxiety and I just feel like I’m going through a lot. This really distracts me and I cant get my mind off the things that are bothering me.    How do I overcome this anxierty and depression?,Anxiety and depression are often linked. I don't consider them as diseases. Depression is a symptom of deep hurts to the sense of self that leaves a person feeling shamed. Anxiety is a symptom of not being given the proper emotional resources to handle the problems of life. It is also the result of being taught that life is a dangerous place that can't be managed.,"Okay, it takes incredible strength to even acknowledge you're struggling and reach out for help. What you’re feeling – a heavy weight of depression and anxiety that's consuming your thoughts – is *very* real, and you're not alone. It’s fantastic that you’re recognizing this and wanting to find a way through it. Let’s break this down and talk about what you can do. **Important Disclaimer: I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. What follows is a guide based on widely accepted strategies, but it’s crucial to consult with a qualified mental health professional for a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan.**

**2. Understanding Depression & Anxiety:**

* **It's Not Your Fault:** Depression and anxiety are complex conditions with biological, psychological, and environmental factors. They aren't a sign of weakness.
* **Symptoms Vary:** Everyone experiences depression and anxiety differently. You might be experiencing:
    * **Depression:** Persistent sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest in activities, changes in appetite or sleep, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, difficulty concentrating.
    * **Anxiety:** Excessive worry, restlessness, irritability, muscle tension, difficulty sleeping, panic attacks.
* **They Often Co-Occur:** It's very common for depression and anxiety to happen together.

**3. Strategies for Managing Symptoms (These are things you can start doing *now*):**

* **Self-Care – The Foundation:**
    * **Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night. Establish a regular sleep schedule.
    * **Nutrition:** Eat a balanced diet. Avoid excessive sugar and processed foods.
    * **Exercise:** Even a short walk can make a difference. Physical activity releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects. Start small – 15-30 minutes a day.
    * **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water.
* **Mindfulness & Relaxation Techniques:**
    * **Deep Breathing:** Practice diaphragmatic breathing – slow, deep breaths that expand your belly.
    * **Meditation:** There are many free guided meditation apps (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer).
    * **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** Tense and release different muscle groups to reduce tension.
    * **Yoga & Tai Chi:** Combine physical movement with mindfulness.
* **Cognitive Techniques:**
    * **Challenge Negative Thoughts:**  When you have a negative thought, ask yourself: ""Is this thought realistic? Is there another way to look at this situation?""  Try to replace negative thoughts with more balanced ones.
    * **Thought Records:** Write down your negative thoughts, the situation that triggered them, and a more realistic response.
* **Engage in Activities You Enjoy (Even if you don't feel like it):**  Start small.  Maybe it's listening to music, reading, spending time in nature, or pursuing a hobby.  The goal is to reconnect with things that bring you joy, even if you don't feel it intensely at first.

**4. Seeking Professional Help – This is Crucial:**

* **Therapy:**  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) are particularly effective for depression and anxiety.  A therapist can help you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.
* **Medication:**  Antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications can be helpful in managing symptoms. *Only* a psychiatrist or doctor can prescribe these.  Discuss the potential benefits and risks with your doctor.
* **Find a Therapist:**
    * **Psychology Today:** [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) – You can search for therapists in your area.
    * **Your Insurance Provider:**  They can provide a list of therapists in your network.

**5. Building a Support System:**

* **Join a Support Group:**  Connecting with others who understand what you're going through can be incredibly helpful.
* **Talk to Friends and Family Regularly:**  Maintain your social connections.

**Important Reminders:**

* **Be Patient:** Recovery takes time. There will be ups and downs. Don’t get discouraged if you have setbacks.
* **Celebrate Small Victories:** Acknowledge and appreciate your progress, no matter how small.
* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself. You are doing the best you can.

*   What specific thoughts or feelings are you struggling with the most right now?

3117,"My husband and I have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. Others have told me that most men would have left me by now. Honestly, I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing. I want to be better connected with my husband.","It's encouraging that you say you want ""to be better connected with [your] husband,"" and since he hasn't left you, he must care about you and the relationship more than he does about just having sex. You don't say whether he complains or not, but even if he doesn't it seems there's a sense of something important missing for both of you.Most likely to connect better with him physically you'll need to become better connected with yourself and your body. Men often feel fulfilled by sex simply because it happened - the woman they want received them, allowed them to make love with her. For women that can sometimes be more complicated. A woman who loves sex most likely also loves her body, knows what pleasures her, and feels confident asking for what she wants. Self-pleasuring can be a way for you to discover more about your sexuality, and a classic resource is Betty Dodson's book Sex for One: The Joy of Selfloving. A good counselor or sex therapist can be very helpful with your whole relationship as well as the sexual part of it, but not all counselors are comfortable working with sexual issues. Shop around and be sure you find someone who can help you and your husband get better connected on all levels.","Okay, this is a really sensitive and understandably difficult situation, and it’s great that you’re recognizing it and wanting to address it. It takes courage to acknowledge these feelings and to want to improve things. Let's break this down and explore some ways to approach this.

**1. Validating Your Feelings:**

* **You're Not Alone:** It's important to acknowledge that a low-frequency sex life, especially after seven years, is actually quite common. Many couples experience periods of reduced intimacy, and it doesn't automatically mean there's something fundamentally wrong with your relationship.
* **External Pressure Doesn’t Define Your Relationship:** The comments you’ve received from others are irrelevant. Your happiness and satisfaction with your marriage are what truly matter.  Letting external opinions dictate your feelings is a trap.
* **Low Sex Drive is Complex:** You're right to consider the possibility of a low sex drive. It can be influenced by a huge number of factors – physical (hormonal imbalances, medication side effects, chronic pain, etc.), psychological (stress, anxiety, depression, past trauma, relationship issues), and emotional. It's not always a simple ""problem"" with one person.
* **Not Knowing What You're Doing Isn't a Shame:** It's perfectly normal to not feel like experts at intimacy after seven years.  Many couples don’t have a ""roadmap"" for their sex life, and figuring that out is a process.

**2. Exploring Your Thoughts and Feelings:**

* **Self-Reflection - Your Drive:** Let's dig a little deeper into *your* feelings about sex.  When you think about sex, what comes up for you? Is it anxiety? Shame? Fear of rejection? Boredom?  Do you genuinely desire it, or are you feeling pressured to want it?  Journaling can be a really helpful tool here.
* **Husband’s Perspective:** Have you talked to your husband about how *he* feels about the frequency of your intimacy?  It's possible he's feeling similarly, or he might have a different perspective entirely. Open and honest communication is absolutely key.
* **Identify Underlying Issues:** Are there other stressors in your life – work, finances, family issues – that might be contributing to a lack of desire? Sometimes, underlying issues can manifest as a decrease in libido.

**3. Communication with Your Husband:**

* **Start with Vulnerability:**  ""Honey, I want to talk about our intimacy. I've been feeling a little insecure and I want to understand how you're feeling about things.  I value our connection, and I want us to be happy.""
* **""I"" Statements:**  Focus on expressing *your* feelings, not blaming him.  Instead of saying ""You never want to have sex,"" try ""I've been feeling like we haven't been connecting intimately, and I miss that connection.""
* **Active Listening:**  Really listen to his response.  Don't interrupt or get defensive. Try to understand his perspective, even if it's different from yours.
* **Ask Open-Ended Questions:** “What’s important to you in our intimacy?” “What would make you feel more connected?”

**4.  Taking Action – Building Connection Beyond Sex:**

* **Focus on Emotional Intimacy:**  Intimacy isn't just about sex. Spend quality time together – talking, sharing experiences, doing things you both enjoy.
* **Small Gestures:**  Little acts of affection – holding hands, cuddling, a spontaneous kiss – can build connection.
* **Date Nights:**  Make time for regular date nights, even if it's just staying in and cooking together.
* **Shared Activities:**  Find hobbies or activities you can enjoy together.

**5. Seeking Professional Help:**

* **Couples Therapy:** A therapist can provide a safe space for you and your husband to communicate openly and honestly, and can help you develop strategies for improving your intimacy.
* **Individual Therapy:**  If you suspect a low sex drive might be linked to underlying issues like anxiety, depression, or past trauma, individual therapy could be beneficial.
* **Medical Evaluation:**  Talk to your doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to a low sex drive.

1729,"I'm a teenager and I get these really intense mood swings.    My mood will be really high and I'll think of something that I want to do. When I start to make it happen I get irritated by other people if they intervene. Then if the thing I wanted to do doesn't work out, I have these tendencies to blame other people for it not working out.    Can you explain what's going on?","Mood swings and getting frustrated when things don't work out is totally normal. Sometimes, we get tied to one thing we really want to do and it can feel pretty intense when that gets interrupted or doesn't work out. This said, you're coming to CounselChat and so I'm guessing this is something that is pretty intense for you and something that you are concerned about. If this is getting in the way of your life, it may be worthwhile to reach out to a therapist or doctor to get some help with this and see if there might be something more going on. While for most people frustration/mood swings is related to typical life and stress, if very intense it can be a sign of a number of challenges ranging from anxiety to a traumatic experience to something like Bipolar Disorder where a person's mood and energy might fly so high (mania) that one feels like they can do anything but often become frustrated when interrupted (note: there is a lot more to Bipolar Disorder than this and this is certainly not a diagnosis). Wish you well!","Okay, let's talk about what you're experiencing. What you're describing – the intense mood swings, the sudden impulses, the irritability when interrupted, and the tendency to blame others – is actually pretty common, especially for teenagers. There are several factors at play here, and it’s great that you’re recognizing it and wanting to understand it. Here’s a breakdown of what might be going on:

**1. The Teenage Brain – It's Still Under Construction:**

* **Neurotransmitter Imbalance:** During adolescence, the brain is undergoing a massive remodeling process. The levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine – which regulate mood, motivation, and reward – are fluctuating wildly. Dopamine is heavily involved in reward and motivation, and it’s often the biggest culprit in these intense mood swings. When you're excited about something, dopamine levels spike, leading to a feeling of euphoria and a strong drive to pursue it.
* **Prefrontal Cortex Development:** The prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for things like impulse control, planning, and rational thinking, is still developing. This means you're less able to override those initial impulses driven by dopamine.  It’s like having a powerful engine (the dopamine drive) and a less-developed steering wheel (the prefrontal cortex) trying to control it.
* **Emotional Reactivity:** Teenagers tend to be more emotionally reactive than adults. This heightened sensitivity can make you feel things very intensely, both positive and negative.

**2. What You're Describing – The Cycle:**

Let’s break down the specific behaviors you mentioned:

* **Intense Mood Swings:** These are driven by dopamine surges. You get excited about something, dopamine floods your brain, and you feel incredibly motivated and happy.
* **Impulsive Behavior:** That intense dopamine surge fuels the urge to *do* something. You don’t always think things through, especially when dopamine is high.
* **Irritability with Interruption:** When someone tries to talk you out of something or interrupt your momentum, it’s like a sudden drop in dopamine. This can trigger irritation because your brain is now trying to maintain that high level of excitement. It’s like the engine suddenly losing power.
* **Blaming Others:** This is often a defense mechanism. When things don't go as planned (and they often don’t when you’re driven by intense emotion), it can feel like a personal attack. Blaming others provides a way to reduce the feeling of failure and maintain a sense of control. It’s easier to blame someone else than to admit you might have made a mistake or that your initial impulse wasn’t the best idea.

**3. Why It Feels So Intense:**

* **High Stakes:** For teenagers, things often *feel* more important and consequential than they are. This heightened sense of importance can amplify emotions.
* **Identity Formation:** Adolescence is a time of figuring out who you are. This process can be confusing and stressful, which can contribute to mood swings.


**What You Can Do:**

* **Recognize the Pattern:** You’ve already taken a huge step by recognizing this pattern. Awareness is key.
* **Pause and Breathe:** When you feel that intense urge coming on, try to take a deep breath and just *pause*. This can give you a moment to step back and assess the situation.
* **Delay Gratification:** Practice delaying gratification.  Instead of immediately acting on an impulse, ask yourself, ""Is this *really* important right now?  Can I wait a little while to see if I still feel this way?""
* **Talk About It:**  Talk to someone you trust – a parent, a counselor, a teacher, or a friend.  Just talking about your feelings can help you process them.
* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself. You’re going through a challenging time of development. Don't beat yourself up when things don't go as planned.

**Important Note:** If these mood swings are significantly impacting your life, causing you distress, or interfering with your relationships, it's a really good idea to talk to a mental health professional. They can help you develop coping strategies and rule out any underlying conditions.

   I've never tried or contemplated suicide. I've always wanted to fix my issues, but I never get around to it.
   How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?","You can, for sure... and the first step is to believe you are worthy TO YOURSELF. Recognizing you are in a quest is already a big first step. Taking the time to start figuring out who you are is definitely the next... do so with SELF COMPASSION and kindness. Know this is a process and just look forward for what you might find.  I do recommend you find someone to talk to (there are many options out there that can fit the situation you are in), and I also recommend you start by giving yourself the importance to invest some time and effort in this quest. YOU DESERVE IT. There are some excellent TED Talks you can google, great books you can read, or even joining a yoga practice, team or some kind of hobby may help. Anything that shows yourself you are worthy of this effort. Have patience and start!!!! the answer is out there waiting for you. Asking these questions already set you on the right path.","Okay, thank you for sharing this. It takes incredible courage to admit you're struggling and to reach out, even in this way. What you’re experiencing – the sleeplessness, the intense negative thoughts, the feeling of worthlessness – is a really difficult combination, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed. The fact that you've never contemplated suicide is a really important piece of information, and it shows you have a desire to keep going, even when it feels impossible.

Let’s address this step-by-step. It’s fantastic that you recognize you want to change these feelings; that’s the first and most crucial step.

**1. Understanding the Root of the Feeling:**

* **Negative Self-Talk:** You've identified a core feeling of worthlessness, and it's likely fueled by a pattern of negative self-talk.  These thoughts aren’t necessarily truths, but they’ve become deeply ingrained.
* **Underlying Issues:** Often, feelings of worthlessness stem from deeper issues like past trauma, difficult relationships, anxiety, depression, or low self-esteem. It’s important to try and understand *why* you're feeling this way.  You don't have to uncover everything at once, but starting to explore the potential sources can be helpful.
* **Perfectionism & High Standards:** Do you hold yourself to impossibly high standards?  Are you critical of yourself?  This can contribute significantly to feelings of inadequacy.

**2. Changing Your Perception of Worth:**

* **Challenge Your Thoughts:** When you have a thought like ""I'm worthless,"" actively challenge it. Ask yourself: ""Is this thought actually true? What evidence do I have to support it? What evidence do I have *against* it?""  Often, you'll find the evidence against it is far stronger than the initial thought.
* **Focus on Your Strengths:**  You mentioned wanting to fix things, which shows you have a desire to improve.  Make a list of things you *are* good at, things you enjoy, and qualities you like about yourself.  It doesn’t have to be huge accomplishments; it could be things like “I’m a good listener,” “I make a decent cup of coffee,” or “I care about my friends.”  Review this list regularly.
* **Practice Self-Compassion:** Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend who was going through a difficult time.  Everyone makes mistakes, everyone has flaws, and everyone deserves compassion.
* **Small Wins:**  Focus on achieving small, achievable goals.  Each time you accomplish something, no matter how small, it builds your confidence and reinforces the idea that you *are* capable.

**3. Addressing the ""Worthless to Everyone"" Feeling:**

* **You Define Worth:** This is a crucial point. Your worth isn't determined by what other people think of you.  It’s inherent, and you have the right to value yourself regardless of external validation.
* **People Have Their Own Issues:**  Sometimes, people's reactions to you are a reflection of their own insecurities, problems, or limitations, not a reflection of your value.
* **Focus on Your Relationships:**  Invest your energy in nurturing relationships with people who support you, believe in you, and make you feel good about yourself.  Distance yourself from those who consistently make you feel bad.

**4. Practical Steps & Seeking Support:**

* **Establish a Routine:**  Lack of sleep can exacerbate negative thoughts.  Try to establish a regular sleep schedule, even if it’s just starting with small changes.
* **Talk to Someone:** This is *so* important.  You don’t have to go through this alone. Here are some options:
    * **Therapist/Counselor:** A therapist can help you explore the root causes of your feelings, develop coping mechanisms, and challenge negative thought patterns.  You can find a therapist through your insurance provider, online directories (like Psychology Today), or local mental health organizations.
    * **Trusted Friend or Family Member:**  Sharing your feelings with someone you trust can provide emotional support and a listening ear.
    * **Crisis Resources:** If you’re struggling to cope, please reach out to one of these resources immediately:

2541,"I think I'm annoying and bothersome, but my girlfriend says I'm just fine. I don't think so, I think I'm stressing everyone else out","I'm glad to hear you have friends and that your friends say they like you.Trust your own sense of who you are which tells you that something feels uneasy within yourself.Is the friend who says you're ""just fine"", very familiar with who you are?""Friend"" is a broad category.She may not know you as fully as you know yourself.Basically, it is possible to be ""fine"" and have some inner stress.Follow your own thoughts and observations to more fully learn about yourself in ways your friend may not notice or be aware.","Okay, this is a really important and vulnerable thing you're feeling, and it’s good that you're recognizing it and talking about it. It’s completely valid to feel like you're annoying or bothersome, even if your girlfriend doesn't see it that way. Let’s break this down and explore what’s going on.

**1. The Disconnect Between Your Perception and Her Perception:**

* **You're Feeling It Deeply:** The fact that you *feel* this way is significant. Feelings are real, and they're often rooted in something deeper than just a surface observation. You're not wrong to feel this way, even if she doesn't see it.
* **Different Perspectives:** People perceive things differently. What you see as annoying, she might not even register. It's possible she's genuinely oblivious, or she might be interpreting your behavior in a way that doesn't align with your intentions.
* **Self-Awareness is Key:** The fact that you're actively questioning yourself and your impact is a *positive* thing. It shows you care about your relationships and want to be a good partner.


**2. Why You Might Be Feeling This Way (Even If She Doesn't See It):**

Let’s explore some potential reasons why you might be feeling this way. This isn't about blaming yourself, but about understanding the source of these feelings:

* **Anxiety:** Anxiety can manifest in ways that others perceive as annoying – excessive worrying, over-planning, needing reassurance, interrupting, or seeming overly focused on details.
* **Need for Reassurance:** You might be subconsciously seeking reassurance that you're ""okay"" or that you're not bothering people.  This can lead to behaviors that seem demanding or needy.
* **Perfectionism:** Do you tend to be overly critical of yourself or others?  This can lead to you pointing out flaws or needing things to be done a certain way.
* **Sensitivity:** Some people are naturally more sensitive to the emotions and reactions of others. You might be picking up on subtle cues that others aren't even aware of.
* **Past Experiences:**  Sometimes, past experiences (e.g., feeling dismissed or ignored) can make us more sensitive to the potential for those feelings happening again.
* **Genuine Behaviors:** It’s possible you *are* exhibiting behaviors that are unintentionally annoying. We all have habits that can irritate others.

**3. Talking to Your Girlfriend:**

You've already taken a big step by acknowledging this to yourself. Now, let’s talk about how to approach your girlfriend:

* **Choose the Right Time:** Don't bring this up in the heat of an argument. Pick a calm, relaxed time when you can have an open and honest conversation.
* **""I Feel"" Statements:** Instead of saying, ""You don't see how annoying I am,"" try something like, ""I've been feeling like I might be stressing people out, and I wanted to talk about it with you.""
* **Be Specific (But Gentle):**  If you can, give her *specific* examples of behaviors that make you feel this way.  ""When I constantly ask if you're okay, it makes me feel like I'm being overly worried, even if that's not my intention.""
* **Ask for Her Perspective:** ""I'd really appreciate it if you could tell me if you've noticed anything about my behavior that might be bothering you. I want to understand how I'm coming across.""
* **Emphasize Your Desire to Improve:** “I want to be a good partner, and I’m working on being more aware of how my actions affect others.”

**4. What You Can Do (Beyond Talking to Your Girlfriend):**

* **Self-Reflection:** Spend time honestly examining your behaviors.  Keep a journal to track when you feel this way and what you were doing at the time.
* **Observe Others:**  Pay attention to how you interact with other people – friends, family, colleagues.  Do you notice patterns?
* **Small Changes:** Start with small, manageable changes.  Maybe it’s consciously taking a deep breath before responding to a question, or letting things go that you don’t need to control.
* **Seek Support:** Talking to a therapist or counselor can be incredibly helpful in understanding your anxieties, developing coping mechanisms, and improving your relationships.

**Important Note:** It’s okay if your girlfriend doesn’t immediately understand or agree with your perspective. This is a process of communication and understanding.

1556,"I was never single, afraid to be alone, and I looked for my boyfriend to make me happy. I finally worked on my self, was in a relationship, and I did everything a healthy girlfriend does and it didn't work out. Now months later, no man peaks my interest. Am I ready to date again? Is there a reason no one sparks my interest?","Yes, of course there's a reason!There's always a reason for most dynamics!Depending on the nature and qualities of what changed as a result of your new self realizations, you may be more deeply affected by your new awareness than how you imagined these would go.Since you already are on the best road possible for yourself, since this resulted from your own introspection, keep trusting your own self work as to what develops and at what pace your relationship attraction qualities grow.","Okay, this is a really common and understandably painful experience, and it’s fantastic that you’re taking a thoughtful look at it. Let's break this down and address your questions honestly.

**Are you ready to date again?**

Honestly, it’s okay *not* to feel ready. You've been through a significant emotional shift – a deep dive into self-discovery and a relationship that ended. That’s a lot to process.  There’s no timeline for readiness.  It’s more about *feeling* a genuine desire to connect with someone, rather than just feeling like you *should* be dating.

Here’s a key thing:  You don’t need to feel *excited* to date.  It’s perfectly normal to feel apprehensive, a little vulnerable, or even just neutral.  Pressuring yourself to “be ready” can actually make things worse.  Instead, focus on building a foundation of self-love and self-acceptance.

**Is there a reason no one peaks your interest?**

This is the core question, and it’s likely a multi-layered one. Here’s a breakdown of potential reasons, combining what you’ve told me with some common dating patterns:

1. **You Were Looking for External Validation:** You mentioned seeking a boyfriend to make you happy. When you were in the relationship, you were likely prioritizing *their* happiness and fulfillment, often at the expense of your own.  This means you might have subconsciously been attracting people who were seeking a ""good girlfriend"" – someone who meets their needs.  Now, without that expectation, you might not be presenting your authentic self, or you might be subconsciously seeking someone who fits that same mold.

2. **Shift in Priorities – and Your Self-Discovery:** You’ve dramatically changed. You’ve invested in yourself, and that’s wonderful! But that means your priorities have shifted.  You're likely valuing things like emotional maturity, personal growth, intellectual connection, and shared values *much* more than you did before.  Men who aren't on a similar journey might not be a good fit.

3. **Fear of Vulnerability:**  Because you've been so focused on avoiding being alone, you might be subconsciously erecting barriers to intimacy.  People pick up on this.  Vulnerability is attractive, and if you're projecting a guardedness, it can be off-putting.

4. **Unrealistic Expectations:**  It’s possible you've built up an ideal of what a “spark” should be, perhaps based on romantic comedies or idealized versions of relationships.  Real connections develop gradually.


5. **You're Not Fully Present:** When you're preoccupied with past hurts, anxieties about being alone, or a need to “find the right person,” you’re not fully present in your interactions. People can sense that.

6. **You Haven't Fully Processed the Breakup:**  It's normal to still be feeling the effects of the breakup.  Unresolved feelings can make it difficult to genuinely connect with someone new.

**What to do Now:**

1. **Self-Reflection:** Spend some serious time journaling.  Really dig into *why* you were seeking a boyfriend, what you learned from the relationship, and what you truly want and need in a partner *now*.

2. **Focus on YOU:** Continue to invest in your own happiness and growth. This isn’t about finding someone to complete you; it’s about becoming the most amazing version of yourself.

3. **Be Open, Not Desperate:**  Go out and meet people, but do it with curiosity and a genuine desire to connect.  Don't force anything.

4. **Be Yourself:**  Let your personality shine through.  Don’t try to be someone you think a man *should* like.

5. **Manage Expectations:**  Recognize that chemistry and ""spark"" can develop over time.  Don't expect instant fireworks.

6. **Consider Therapy (If Needed):**  If the breakup is significantly impacting your life, or if you're struggling with anxiety or self-doubt, talking to a therapist can be incredibly helpful.

**Important Note:**  It's okay if no one immediately sparks your interest.  That’s a sign that you’re being discerning and selective – which is a good thing!  The goal isn’t to find “the one” right away; it’s about building a foundation of self-love and creating opportunities for meaningful connections to emerge.

599,"When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. She is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but I am afraid she is stressing too much. I’m afraid it’s going to break her. I don't know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal.","It may be helpful to register for a class you can take together. I would recommend mindful meditation or yoga, just the two of you. Something you find time for in a weekly basis. Yoga is amazing in learning mindfulness and reducing stress. I use yoga and mindful techniques when working with children and recommend it to parents to engage with their children. Hope this helps.","It's incredibly understandable that you're feeling this way. Seeing your daughter struggling with anxiety, especially when it seems disproportionate to the situation and she’s otherwise a high-achiever, is deeply concerning. You're right to recognize this as potentially more than just a ""silly thing"" and to worry about its impact on her well-being. Let's break down how to approach this:

**1. Validate Her Feelings – Don't Dismiss Them:**

* **Acknowledge her distress:** The first and most important thing is to let her know you see she's hurting. Saying things like, ""I can see you're really upset about this,"" or ""It sounds like this is really bothering you,"" can make a huge difference. Dismissing her feelings with phrases like ""Don't worry about it,"" or “It’s not a big deal” will likely make her feel invalidated and misunderstood.
* **Normalize anxiety:** Let her know that it's okay to feel anxious, even about things that seem small to others. ""It’s normal to feel worried sometimes, especially when things feel uncertain.""

**2. Explore the Root Cause (Gently):**

* **Talk, don’t interrogate:** Start a conversation, not an interrogation. Ask open-ended questions like:
    * “Can you tell me more about what's making you feel this way?”
    * “What specifically is worrying you about this situation?”
    * “What thoughts are going through your head when you feel this way?”
* **Look for patterns:** Is this happening frequently? Are there specific situations that trigger it (e.g., tests, social interactions, specific teachers)?
* **Consider underlying stressors:** Sometimes, a seemingly small issue can be a symptom of something deeper. Is she struggling with:
    * **Social pressure:** Even though she's a good student, she could be feeling pressure from friends, or comparing herself to others.
    * **Perfectionism:** The drive for a 4.0 can be incredibly stressful.
    * **Fear of failure:** This is very common, especially in high-achieving students.
    * **Changes at home or school:** New routines, family dynamics, or a new school environment can be overwhelming.

**3. Help Her Develop Coping Strategies:**

* **Breathing exercises:** Teach her simple deep breathing techniques to calm herself down in the moment.
* **Grounding techniques:** These help bring her back to the present moment. Examples include: 5-4-3-2-1 (name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste).
* **Positive self-talk:** Help her reframe negative thoughts. ""I can handle this,"" or ""I’ve overcome challenges before.""
* **Problem-solving (if appropriate):** If the issue is solvable, work *with* her to brainstorm solutions.  However, don't take over the problem - she needs to feel like she's in control.

**4. When to Seek Professional Help:**

You're right to consider this beyond “normal.” Here’s when it’s particularly important to consult a professional:

* **Frequent and intense episodes:** If the crying and anxiety are happening very often.
* **Significant impact on her life:** If it's interfering with her sleep, eating, relationships, or schoolwork.
* **Physical symptoms:** If she’s experiencing physical symptoms like stomach aches, headaches, or rapid heart rate along with the anxiety.
* **Self-harm thoughts or behaviors:** *This is an emergency – seek immediate help.*
* **You're concerned:** Trust your instincts. You know your daughter best.

**Professionals Who Can Help:**

* **School Counselor:** A good starting point for support and guidance.
* **Therapist/Counselor:**  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is often effective for anxiety in teenagers.
* **Psychiatrist:** Can prescribe medication if needed, in conjunction with therapy.

**Important Note:**  You're doing a great job by recognizing this and wanting to help your daughter.  Be patient, supportive, and let her know you’re there for her, no matter what.  It’s okay to seek help – it’s a sign of strength, not weakness.

2699,"I'm fine when we start becoming intimate, but out of nowhere, I will get a flashback of what happened to me in the past. I start hysterically crying and freaking out when my boyfriend obviously has done nothing to hurt me.","Have you sought the support of a therapist really qualified in working through sexual trauma? It can take some work, but healing is possible. If you feel able to, it may also help to open a dialogue with your boyfriend about what you need from him when you have these flashbacks. Let him know what some helpful responses may be. ","Okay, this sounds incredibly distressing and frustrating, and it's fantastic that you're reaching out to understand it better. What you're describing – experiencing flashbacks triggered by intimacy and responding with intense, disproportionate reactions – is a complex issue that can be linked to several potential factors. Let's break this down and explore some possible explanations and what you can do:

**1. Understanding the Phenomenon: Trauma and Flashbacks**

* **Trauma Responses:** Flashbacks are a hallmark of trauma responses. When a traumatic event occurs, it doesn't just disappear from your memory. It can become deeply embedded in your nervous system. The brain essentially tries to process the event, and sometimes, it does so in bursts – these are flashbacks.
* **Fight, Flight, Freeze:** Trauma often hijacks the body's natural stress response (the fight, flight, or freeze response). Even seemingly innocuous stimuli – like intimacy, which can trigger feelings of vulnerability – can reactivate this response, leading to a flashback.
* **Dissociation:**  Dissociation is a defense mechanism where you feel detached from your body, your emotions, or reality. It's a common response to trauma and can amplify the intensity of flashbacks.
* **Sensory Triggers:** Intimacy often involves physical touch, which can be a powerful sensory trigger for past trauma.  The sensations can mimic the sensations experienced during the original traumatic event.

**2. Why This Happens in the Moment with Your Boyfriend**

* **Lack of Awareness:** Your boyfriend may not understand *why* you're reacting the way you are. He likely has no conscious knowledge of the trauma that's triggering the response. This can make him feel helpless and frustrated, which understandably adds to your distress.
* **Feeling of Threat:** Even if he hasn't done anything wrong, the flashbacks can feel like a threat – a re-experiencing of the original danger. This can trigger a primal fear response.
* **Heightened Vulnerability:** Intimacy creates vulnerability, and for someone with a trauma history, that vulnerability can be intensely activating.

**3. What You Can Do – Immediate Steps**

* **Communicate Clearly and Calmly (When Possible):**  When you're *not* in the midst of a flashback, talk to your boyfriend about what's happening. Explain that it's not about him, but about a past trauma that’s being reactivated.  Say something like, “When I get overwhelmed like this, it’s not you. It’s a memory that’s flooding back, and it’s a very intense reaction.”
* **Grounding Techniques:**  Learn and practice grounding techniques *before* you feel a flashback coming on. These help bring you back to the present moment:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:** Slow, deep breaths can calm the nervous system.
    * **Physical Touch (If Safe):**  Sometimes, a gentle touch from your boyfriend (if you’re comfortable with it) can be grounding.
* **Safe Word/Signal:** Establish a safe word or signal with your boyfriend that you can use *before* you feel overwhelmed. This allows you to communicate that you need to stop and take a break.
* **Recognize Your Triggers:** Start to notice what *specifically* triggers the flashbacks.  Is it a certain type of touch? A particular word? A certain environment?

**4. Long-Term Steps – Seeking Professional Help is Crucial**

* **Therapy is Essential:** This is the *most* important step.  Specifically, look for a therapist who specializes in trauma.  Here are some therapeutic approaches that can be helpful:
    * **Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT):**  Helps you process the trauma and develop coping skills.
    * **Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR):**  Uses bilateral stimulation (like eye movements) to help reprocess traumatic memories.
    * **Somatic Experiencing:**  Focuses on releasing the physical tension held in the body from the trauma.
* **Medical Evaluation:**  Rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the symptoms (though this is less likely, it’s worth discussing with your doctor).

**5. Important Considerations for Your Relationship**

* **Patience and Understanding:** Your boyfriend needs to be incredibly patient and understanding. This isn’t about him doing something wrong; it’s about you processing a deeply ingrained trauma.
* **His Role:** He can be a supportive partner by learning about trauma, practicing empathy, and being willing to adjust intimacy levels until you’re both comfortable.
* **Self-Care:** Prioritize your own well-being.  Engage in activities that help you relax and feel grounded.

I sometimes still do it but I don't exactly know why,    I have anxiety and I had a rough childhood but now I'll start to hit my head and sometimes not realize it but I don't know how to stop or even why I'm doing it.    How can I help myself to change my behavior?","The best way to handle anxiety of this level is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor, and therapy to help you understand the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are causing the anxiety. This is not something that anyone should just “white knuckle” and try to get through on their own with no help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety. This takes a therapist trained in CBT. You will learn to recognize when and why you perform the behavior of hitting your head, help you deal with the underlying cause of this, and replace the behavior with a more positive behavior. You'll learn coping skills.You mention having a rough childhood. Anyone who has experienced trauma like this, especially long-term ongoing trauma from abuse of any kind, definitely does not need ""exposure therapy"", which is what is recommended for phobias. You need a therapist trained specifically in trauma informed therapy.You are on the right path by recognizing there is an issue and what it is. Good luck with your healing journey!","Okay, this is a really important and complex issue, and it’s fantastic that you’re recognizing it and wanting to address it. It’s incredibly common for people with anxiety and a challenging past to develop behaviors like hitting their head, and it's a sign you're aware of a need for change, which is a huge first step. Let's break down how you can approach this, recognizing it's likely a combination of factors and will require patience and self-compassion.

**1. Understanding the ""Why"" – It's Likely More Than Just a Habit**

* **Trauma & Coping:** Your rough childhood and anxiety are absolutely central here. Hitting your head can be a deeply ingrained coping mechanism developed in response to overwhelming feelings – anger, frustration, fear, shame, or a sense of being out of control. It might have been a way to release intense emotions you didn’t know how to process at the time.
* **Sensory Seeking:** Sometimes, hitting your head can be a sensory-seeking behavior – a way to provide a physical sensation when feeling overwhelmed or restless.
* **Dissociation:**  Hitting your head can sometimes be a form of dissociation, a way to detach from a painful experience or emotion.
* **Automaticity:** It’s likely become a very automatic response, almost like a reflex, reinforced over time.

**2. Immediate Steps – Recognizing and Interrupting the Behavior**

* **Awareness is Key:** The fact that you're noticing it is your superpower.  Start by becoming *hyper*-aware of the moments leading up to the head-hitting. What were you feeling? What triggered it?  Keep a journal to track this.
* **Gentle Interruption:** When you feel the urge to hit your head, try a gentle interruption. This could be:
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can help calm your nervous system.
    * **Grounding Techniques:**  The 5-4-3-2-1 technique (name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste) can bring you back to the present moment.
    * **Physical Movement:** A quick stretch, a walk, or even just shaking your arms can help release tension.
    * **Self-Talk:**  A simple phrase like “I notice this urge, but I can handle it” can help you regain control.
* **Don’t Shame Yourself:** This is *crucial*.  Every time you catch yourself doing it, don’t beat yourself up.  Acknowledge it, gently redirect, and move on. Self-criticism will only make things harder.

**3. Addressing the Underlying Issues – Seeking Professional Support is Highly Recommended**

* **Therapy is Essential:**  Given your history and anxiety, working with a therapist is the most effective long-term solution. Here are some therapeutic approaches that could be helpful:
    * **Trauma-Focused Therapy:**  EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), Somatic Experiencing, or Narrative Therapy can help you process and heal from past trauma.
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** CBT can help you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.
    * **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):** DBT teaches skills for managing intense emotions, improving relationships, and coping with distress.
    * **Anxiety Therapy:** Addressing the underlying anxiety itself will significantly reduce the frequency of these urges.
* **Talk to Your Doctor:** Discuss your symptoms with your primary care physician. They can rule out any underlying medical conditions and potentially refer you to a specialist.

1091,"My husband and I had our first threesome recently. Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me.    He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better, and now I'm craving more of it. But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling. Why am I feeling this way?","You need to have an honest conversation with each other about WHY you both want a threesome. Evaluate the status of your relationship with each other. Are you having issues? Fighting? Not feeling satisfied with each other? How has your sex life been with each other?  If there are any problems, insecurities, issues, introducing something like this may only make your relationship worse. Open relationships and threesomes rarely work out well. Sure, there are some who successfully live this lifestyle, but it only works when both people are completely secure in their relationship with each other, harbor no jealousies or insecurities, and aren't looking to someone else to satisfy needs that aren't getting met by their spouse. Let me say that again: This is not likely to work out well for you if either of you are insecure, jealous, or looking to have needs met by this other person that you aren't getting from your spouse. That empty feeling you're having - listen to it. Dig deep to find out where it is coming from. What thoughts are going through your head when you feel that way? You'll get the answer.The other thing that helps make something like this work is for both of you to listen and respect each other. If you don't like it that he paid more attention to the other girl, he needs to know that, and he needs to respect that.  If you're going to do it again, he needs to know what you're comfortable with and what you want. Set the limits before you're in the moment, before it's too late to take an action back. Turn it around and ask him what he would be comfortable with if it were a man instead of a woman.It is perfectly natural to be curious and want to experiment. A lot of people get that out of the way before settling down in a monogamous relationship. People who marry young and/or inexperienced may still feel that curiosity about things like that and want to experience them, but don't want to hurt their spouse. The REASON you are both doing this matters a lot. If there are problems in your relationship, this is likely to only make things worse.","Okay, let's unpack this. It's incredibly common to experience a complex mix of feelings after a new and intense experience like a threesome, and what you're describing – that initial empty feeling – is a really important signal. There's a lot going on here, and it's fantastic that you're paying attention to it and wanting to understand it. Here's a breakdown of potential reasons why you're feeling this way, combining emotional, psychological, and even physiological factors:

**1. Neurological & Hormonal Shifts:**

* **Dopamine Rush:** Threesomes, especially when involving drinking, can trigger a massive release of dopamine – the ""reward"" neurotransmitter. This intense rush can be addictive in a way, and the subsequent drop can lead to a feeling of emptiness or craving as your brain tries to restore balance.
* **Oxytocin & Vasopressin:** These hormones are released during bonding experiences, including intimacy. While they create feelings of connection and attachment, a sudden shift in these levels after the experience can contribute to the feeling of emptiness.
* **Post-Event Serotonin Dip:** Serotonin, which regulates mood, can also fluctuate after intense experiences, potentially leading to sadness or a feeling of loss.

**2. Emotional and Psychological Factors:**

* **Unmet Needs & Desire for Connection:** You mentioned your husband talking it through, and that's a really important step. It sounds like you realized you were craving deeper connection and perhaps a feeling of being *seen* and *desired* within the dynamic. The threesome may have briefly fulfilled that need, and now you're recognizing the void.
* **Feeling Left Out/Excluded:** Even though you were involved, it's possible you’re feeling a subtle sense of being left out of the primary connection between your husband and her. This is particularly true if the intimacy felt particularly intense between them.
* **Fear of Disconnection:**  New sexual experiences can trigger anxieties about the future of your relationship. You might be worried about the dynamic shifting, or about your place within it.
* **Idealization/Fantasy vs. Reality:** It’s easy to romanticize a first experience. The reality might not immediately match the intense feelings you had, leading to a feeling of disappointment or a longing for that initial rush.
* **Guilt or Shame (Even if Unconscious):**  It’s possible, even if you don’t consciously feel guilt, that you’re grappling with societal or personal beliefs about threesomes.

**3. The ""Empty Feeling"" - What It Really Means:**

That specific ""empty feeling"" is often a sign of a fundamental unmet need. It’s not necessarily about wanting *more* of the threesome itself, but rather about a deeper desire for:

* **Intimacy:** Not just physical, but emotional and intellectual.
* **Validation:** Feeling truly valued and desired by both your husband and, perhaps, by the other woman.
* **Security:**  A sense of stability and trust within your relationship.

**What You Can Do:**

1. **Talk to Your Husband:**  You've already started this process, which is excellent.  Be honest about the emptiness you're feeling.  Use ""I feel"" statements to express your needs clearly: “I’m feeling a bit empty after the experience, and I think I need more emotional connection with you.”
2. **Explore Your Needs:** Spend some time reflecting on *what* you’re truly craving. Write it down.  Is it more cuddling?  More deep conversations?  More shared activities?
3. **Schedule Connection Time:**  Don't just wait for the desire to arise.  Proactively plan activities that foster emotional intimacy – date nights, shared hobbies, meaningful conversations.
4. **Consider Therapy (Individual or Couples):**  A therapist can provide a safe space to explore these feelings in depth, help you understand the underlying dynamics, and develop strategies for building a stronger, more fulfilling relationship.  This is especially helpful if you’re struggling to articulate your needs or if there are deeper issues at play.
5. **Manage Expectations:**  Recognize that this was a new experience, and it takes time to adjust and understand the full impact.

**Important Note:**  It’s okay to have complex feelings after a new sexual experience.  Don’t judge yourself.  The fact that you’re aware of these feelings and wanting to understand them is a positive sign.

To help me give you even more tailored advice, could you tell me a little more about:

*   How long after the experience you're feeling this way?

144,"I'm in my mid 20s with a husband and children. I love my family, but I feel like I've lost my identity, and I don't know who I am other than a mom and wife. At times, all I can think is what I gave up and how I feel unhappy and trapped, but I know I'd feel like worse without them. I loathe myself at times. I have an amazing life, so why can't I just enjoy it?","It is not easy being a wife and mother. You have shifted roles in your life. You went from having a career to focusing on your family. Transitioning can be hard, especially when we feel we gave something up that we really wanted. I want to acknowledge you for wanting to be the best wife and mother you can. I think it is great that you are self-aware and want to work on this.Feeling ""unhappy and trapped"" may also mean that you are  believing these negative thoughts are absolutely true. We have lots and lots of thoughts throughout the day. Sometimes we pay a lot of attention to some and some we ignore. Right now these thoughts are getting a lot of your attention and perhaps you are thinking because you are thinking them they are true.  Is it really true that you trapped? You also said that you have an amazing life. It doesn't sound like you are only having negative thoughts. You have some positive ones, too. However, you are giving a lot of weight to the negative thoughts, more weight than the positive ones.I also wonder if you are struggling with the fact that you are even having this thought. One thing that can be helpful is to recognize that you are having a thought, that it is a negative thought, that thinking it does not make it true, and to let it go. This is the basis for mindfulness work that can be really helpful. It is a great place for you to start so you can balance out your thoughts and emotions.Best of luck to you!","Okay, let's unpack this. What you're describing is incredibly common, especially for women in your situation. It's a really tough place to be, feeling like you've lost yourself within the roles of wife and mother, and battling those intense feelings of self-loathing. The fact that you recognize this and are reaching out is a *huge* first step, and honestly, a really brave one.

Let's address each part of what you've said:

**1. Losing Your Identity:** You’ve essentially become defined by your roles, and that’s a natural thing to happen when you’re building a family. The focus shifts, and it’s incredibly easy to let your own needs and desires fall by the wayside. It’s like you’ve been running a marathon for everyone else, and you’ve forgotten to take care of yourself.

**2. The ""What I Gave Up"" Feeling & Unhappiness:** This is a really powerful and painful feeling. It’s not just about missed opportunities; it's about a sense of regret and feeling like you haven't honored your own dreams and aspirations.  The feeling of being “trapped” likely stems from this – feeling like you've sacrificed too much to change course.  It’s okay to grieve for what you *thought* you wanted, but dwelling on it constantly isn't helpful.

**3. Self-Loathing:** This is the most critical part to address. Self-loathing is a sign of deep distress and often stems from feeling like you’re not measuring up, or that you’ve made mistakes, or that you’re somehow fundamentally flawed. It’s important to understand that this isn't about you being a bad person; it's about a serious emotional struggle.

**4. Enjoying Your Life – Why Can't You?** You're right, you *do* have an amazing life. That's the source of the conflict – you *want* to enjoy it, but you're battling a powerful internal force.  The fact that you recognize this shows you have the capacity to change things.

**Here's what we can do, and what you can start doing:**

* **Acknowledge and Validate Your Feelings:** Don't try to push the negative feelings away. Allow yourself to feel them. Saying to yourself, ""I'm feeling this way, and it's okay that I'm feeling this way,"" can be a powerful starting point.
* **Start Small:** You don’t have to overhaul your entire life overnight.  Pick *one* small thing you enjoy, or used to enjoy, and schedule it into your week.  Maybe it's reading for 30 minutes, taking a bath, going for a short walk, or listening to music.  Just a tiny act of self-care.
* **Reconnect with Your Past Self:** What were you passionate about before you had kids? What made you feel alive?  Even if you can’t fully return to those things, exploring them can help you reconnect with who you were and what you value.
* **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be incredibly helpful in processing them and understanding their root causes.
* **Talk to Someone:** This is *crucial*. Talking to a therapist is an excellent option. They can provide you with a safe space to explore your feelings, develop coping mechanisms, and work through the underlying issues.  A therapist can help you understand the patterns that are contributing to your feelings.
* **Communicate with Your Husband:**  Let him know you're struggling and that you need his support.  This isn’t about blaming him; it’s about creating a partnership.  He may not fully understand the depth of your feelings, but he can be a valuable ally.

**A Final Thought:** You are *not* broken. You are a woman who has taken on a huge responsibility and is now grappling with the consequences.  It’s a sign of strength that you’re recognizing this and seeking a way forward. Be kind to yourself.  This is a journey, not a destination.

*   **When did you start feeling this way?** Was there a specific event or time period that triggered it?
*   **What are some of the things you used to enjoy before you had children?**

211,I am going through a very hard time and I'm so depressed. My parents are getting a divorce and a lot of bad things are happening. I want to lull myself.,"It sounds like a tough time and it's normal to feel down when your family is going through a divorce or other hardship. There's a difference between feelings like sadness, discouragement, grief, loneliness and depression, though. Sadness is sadness and sometimes we have to go through a grieving or other process, that is a normal reaction to events in our lives. Depression, on the other hand, is more about being stuck. Lulling yourself with self-care sounds like a healthy response and a way to give yourself support. So as to the uncomfortable but healthy part of your feelings, do the best you can to put names to it and share with a trusted other person. You will find comfort. The part of your situation that's depression -- feeling stuck, not able to get out of bad, concentrate, changes in sleeping and eating, loss of enjoyment in living, poor hygiene, feelings of hopelessness, that's different. First step, identify your own symptoms of depression. If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself, tell someone. If you're not sure, you can try 800-lifenet or other support line to get feedback. First aid for depression includes: daily care and feeding, good sleeping and eating, lots of exercise--even when you don't feel like it-- healthy socializing, and focusing on talking to yourself in a positive way. If you aren't able to move yourself out of your depression,  work with a professional to make short-term goals and get some support. You may also talk to your doctor or psychiatrist about trying an anti-depressant to give you a little lift while you go through a rough patch.Best wishes,Karen","Okay, it sounds like you're carrying an immense weight right now, and it takes incredible strength just to reach out. It’s completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and wanting to find a way to just... escape. The fact that you're recognizing this urge and wanting to talk about it is a really important first step. Let's talk about what you're going through and how to navigate this incredibly difficult time.

**First, let's acknowledge the intensity of what you're feeling.**  A divorce, coupled with other ""bad things,"" is a massive stressor. It's okay to feel depressed, hopeless, angry, confused, and a whole range of emotions.  There’s no “right” way to feel, and trying to suppress those feelings will only make things harder in the long run. You're not weak for feeling this way; you're human, and you're dealing with a profoundly painful situation.

**Regarding your desire to ""lull yourself"" – I want to address that directly.**  The urge to numb yourself with anything – whether it’s substances, excessive sleeping, or other distractions – often comes from a deep place of pain. While it might feel temporarily comforting, it ultimately avoids addressing the root of the problem and can actually make things worse in the long run. It can create a cycle of avoidance and make it harder to cope with difficult emotions.

**Here's what I want to offer you, broken down into immediate steps and longer-term strategies:**

**1. Immediate Safety & Support:**

* **You're Not Alone:** Please know that you don’t have to go through this by yourself. There are people who care about you and want to help.
* **Talk to Someone You Trust:**  Is there a friend, family member, teacher, or counselor you feel safe talking to?  Just voicing your feelings can make a huge difference.  If you don’t feel comfortable talking to someone you know, that’s okay – we’ll explore other options.
* **Crisis Resources (Immediate Support):**  Here are some resources that are available 24/7:
    * **SAMHSA National Helpline:** 1-800-662-HELP (4357) – This is a free, confidential, 24/7 information service, in English and Spanish, providing referrals to local treatment facilities, support groups, and community-based organizations.  https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline
    * **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741 – This provides free, 24/7 crisis support via text.
    * **The Trevor Project:** 1-866-488-7386 (for LGBTQ youth) or https://www.thetrevorproject.org/
    * **The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline:** 988 – This connects you to a local crisis center.

**2. Understanding Your Feelings & Coping Strategies (Short-Term):**

* **Allow Yourself to Feel:** Instead of trying to push the sadness away, acknowledge it.  Say to yourself, ""I'm feeling really sad right now, and that's okay.""  Trying to fight the feeling can actually make it stronger.
* **Grounding Techniques:** When you're feeling overwhelmed, grounding techniques can help bring you back to the present moment. Try these:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Focus on slow, deep breaths. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 6 seconds.
* **Gentle Activities:**  Engage in activities that you find calming, even if you don't feel like it. This could be taking a warm bath, listening to music, reading a book, or spending time in nature (if possible).  Don't put pressure on yourself to be productive.
* **Self-Care:**  Make sure you're eating regular meals, getting enough sleep (as much as possible), and staying hydrated.

**3. Longer-Term Support & Healing:**

* **Therapy:**  Talking to a therapist can provide you with a safe space to process your emotions, develop coping strategies, and work through the challenges you're facing.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) are often helpful for dealing with depression and difficult life events.
* **Support Groups:**  Connecting with others who are going through similar experiences can be incredibly validating and helpful.
* **Family Counseling:**  If appropriate, family counseling could help improve communication and resolve conflicts related to the divorce.

**Important Note:**  I understand you mentioned wanting to “lull yourself.”  Let’s reframe that. Instead of trying to escape, let’s focus on finding ways to *manage* those difficult feelings so you can move forward.

**I want to reiterate: You don’t have to go through this alone.  I’m here to listen, and I want to help you find the support you need.**

**To help me understand how I can best support you, could you tell me a little more about what's going on?  You don’t have to share anything you’re not comfortable with, but perhaps you could tell me:**

*   **Can you tell me a little bit about the ""bad things"" you mentioned?** (You don't have to go into detail if you don't want to, but a general idea would be helpful.)
*   **How long have you been feeling this way?**
*   **Is there anything specific that triggered these feelings?**
*   **On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the least and 10 being the most, how intense are you feeling right now?**

**Again, please know that reaching out is a sign of strength, and I’m here to help you navigate this challenging time.**

787,I've been with the mother of my child for years.,I would think that you hold little self worth and feel that you are not worthy of better.  I would suggest that you get to know yourself.   What do you NEED in a relationship?  What is holding you to this relationship other than your child?  What have gone on in the relationship that makes you think or feel you deserve such disrespect?  Just a few questions to ask yourself..,"Okay, this is a really significant and potentially complex situation. It's good that you're acknowledging it and potentially looking for support. Being in a long-term relationship with the mother of your child brings a unique set of challenges and considerations. Let's break this down and explore some things you might be experiencing and what steps you can consider.

**1. Understanding the Dynamics:**

* **Long-Term Relationship:** Years is a *long* time. This suggests a deep history, established routines, and likely a significant emotional investment from both of you.  It’s important to recognize the weight of that history.
* **Co-Parenting:** You're fundamentally co-parents. Your relationship with the mother of your child is inextricably linked to your role as a father. This requires communication, cooperation, and often, compromise.
* **Emotional Complexity:** Long-term relationships, especially with a significant other who is also a parent, are filled with a lot of emotions – love, affection, frustration, resentment, hope, disappointment. It's normal to experience a wide range of feelings.
* **Potential for Conflict:**  Disagreements about parenting styles, finances, schedules, and other aspects of your child's life are almost inevitable. How you handle these conflicts is crucial.

**2. What You Might Be Feeling:**

It's important to acknowledge and understand your own feelings. Here are some common feelings people in your situation experience:

* **Love and Affection:** You likely still have strong feelings for her.
* **Responsibility and Commitment:** You feel a deep sense of responsibility for your child and your role as a father.
* **Frustration and Resentment:**  Disagreements or perceived lack of support can lead to frustration and resentment.
* **Loneliness:**  A long-term relationship with a co-parent can sometimes feel isolating.
* **Uncertainty:** You might be questioning the future of the relationship and its impact on your child.
* **Guilt:** You might feel guilty about the situation, even if it's working relatively well.

**3. Key Considerations & Potential Paths Forward:**

* **Communication is Paramount:** Open, honest, and respectful communication with the mother of your child is *essential*. This isn't about blaming or accusing; it's about understanding each other's perspectives and working together for the benefit of your child.
* **Co-Parenting Strategies:**
    * **Establish Clear Boundaries:** Define expectations regarding communication, decision-making, and involvement in your child's life.
    * **Focus on Your Child’s Needs:** Always prioritize your child's well-being and stability.
    * **Joint Decision-Making:**  Whenever possible, make decisions together, especially those that affect your child.
    * **Respectful Disagreements:** Learn to disagree respectfully and find compromises.
* **Relationship Assessment:**  You need to honestly assess the state of your relationship with the mother of your child. Is it healthy and supportive, or is it strained and conflict-ridden?
* **Consider Couples Counseling:** If you are struggling to communicate effectively or resolve conflicts, couples counseling can provide a safe and structured environment to work through issues.
* **Individual Therapy:**  Talking to a therapist on your own can help you process your feelings, develop coping strategies, and gain clarity about your needs and goals.
* **Long-Term Vision:**  Think about what you want for your child’s future and how your relationship with the mother of your child fits into that picture.

299,"I've got so much anger. I don't know how to control myself. My girlfriend screams at me all the time, and sometime I don't know how to deal with life. I'm very depressed and angry. I feel lost.","Hi Campbell River, You say you have anger but you don't mention how it shows. Or maybe it doesn't. Are you aggressive with your girlfriend? Since you mention depression, I wonder if you're bottling it all up somewhere instead of letting it show at all. If this is the case, I admire your ability to not lash out at someone who's hurting you. However, if they are totally  unexpressed, anger turn inward and shift into depression. When she yells at you, what do you do? Is this the moment that you feel the most angry? I wouldn't be surprised; anger is a normal response to someone yelling at you. Something about anger...it's often there to cover up our more vulnerable emotions. Under the anger I wonder if you feel worthless, powerless, scared, unloved. Part of the trick to reducing anger is identifying those other emotions and expressing them. You say you don't know how to deal with life, and I think maybe you mean you don't know how to deal with emotions. Lots of people don't! This is confusing for most of us. What am I feeling? Why is it so strong? I'm afraid to express it for fear of hurting someone (or falling apart, or feeling alone...). How do I know what to express and what to be quiet about? These are all great questions to ask yourself, and a qualified therapist can help you sort it all out and support you in your growth. I wish you well!","Okay, thank you for sharing this with me. It takes a lot of courage to admit you're struggling and to reach out, and I want you to know you're not alone. What you're describing – intense anger, feeling overwhelmed, dealing with a partner who is also struggling, and experiencing depression – is incredibly difficult, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling lost. Let's break this down and talk about some steps you can take.

**1. Recognizing and Validating Your Feelings:**

* **What you’re feeling is real:** The first and most important thing is to acknowledge that your anger, depression, and sense of being lost are *valid*. Don’t try to minimize them or tell yourself you *shouldn’t* be feeling this way. These are serious emotions, and it’s okay to experience them.
* **Anger as a Response:** Anger is often a secondary emotion. It’s often masking feelings like fear, sadness, hurt, or frustration.  Trying to understand *why* you’re angry can be a helpful first step.

**2. Dealing with Your Girlfriend's Behavior:**

* **It's Not Your Fault:**  I want to be very clear: your girlfriend's screaming and behavior are *her* responsibility. You don’t have to take the blame for her actions.
* **Setting Boundaries (This is Crucial):** You have the right to be treated with respect.  You can say something like, ""I understand you're upset, but yelling isn’t a constructive way to communicate. I need you to speak to me calmly, or I’m going to need to take some space.""  Practice saying this. It can be hard, but it's important for your well-being.
* **Recognize You Can't Change Her:** You can't force her to change. You can only control your own reactions and behavior.
* **Consider Your Options:** This is a difficult situation. You may need to seriously consider whether this relationship is healthy for you. If her behavior is consistently abusive (and screaming can be), it’s important to prioritize your safety and well-being.

**3. Addressing Your Depression and Anger:**

* **Talk to Someone – This is Key:**  I want to strongly encourage you to reach out for professional help. Here are some options:
    * **Therapist/Counselor:**  A therapist can help you understand the root causes of your anger and depression, teach you coping mechanisms, and help you develop healthier communication skills.  You can find therapists through:
        * **Your Doctor:** They can refer you to therapists in your area.
        * **Online Therapy:** Services like Talkspace, BetterHelp, and Amwell offer convenient and affordable therapy options.
        * **University Counseling Centers:** If you're a student, your university likely has a counseling center.
    * **Support Groups:**  Connecting with others who understand what you're going through can be incredibly helpful.
    * **Crisis Lines:** If you're feeling overwhelmed or having thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out immediately:
        * **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Dial 988
        * **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741
* **Coping Strategies:**  While professional help is essential, here are some things you can try in the meantime:
    * **Deep Breathing Exercises:**  When you feel anger rising, focus on your breath. Slow, deep breaths can help calm your nervous system.
    * **Grounding Techniques:**  These techniques help you reconnect with the present moment.  Examples include: 5-4-3-2-1 (name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste).
    * **Physical Activity:** Exercise can be a great way to release pent-up energy and improve your mood.
    * **Relaxation Techniques:**  Try meditation, yoga, or progressive muscle relaxation.
    * **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them.

**4. Seeking Support:**

* **Talk to a Trusted Friend or Family Member:**  Sharing your feelings with someone you trust can provide emotional support.
* **Don't Isolate Yourself:**  Even when you don’t feel like it, try to maintain connections with others.

2043,Does counseling really do anything that can help people?,"Hi!  Great question.  I believe counseling does help people! Of course, I am a therapist, so I would think that! :)  Seriously - I think therapy and counseling allow us to understand ourselves, our motivations and the things that bring us happiness and discontent.  Therapy can create opportunities to try new skills and enhance positive attributes that are already present in someone.  I like to think of therapy as an unbiased ""aerial view"" of our lives. Someone outside can often help us notice things we might otherwise miss. Hope this helps!","Okay, let's tackle this really important question: Does counseling really do anything that can help people? The short answer is **yes, research consistently shows that counseling can be incredibly effective for a wide range of issues.** However, it's a nuanced topic, and the degree of effectiveness varies depending on several factors. Here's a breakdown of what we know, broken down into different aspects:

**1. The Evidence Base - Why We Believe It Works:**

* **Research Studies:** Hundreds of studies, including randomized controlled trials (considered the gold standard), demonstrate the effectiveness of various types of counseling.  Meta-analyses (studies that combine the results of multiple studies) consistently show positive outcomes.
* **Specific Disorders:** Counseling has been proven effective in treating:
    * **Depression:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a particularly well-established treatment.
    * **Anxiety Disorders:** CBT, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and other approaches are frequently used.
    * **Trauma:** Trauma-focused therapies like Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) and Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) are crucial.
    * **Relationship Problems:** Couples and family therapy can significantly improve communication and resolve conflicts.
    * **Addiction:** Motivational Interviewing and CBT are key components of addiction treatment.
    * **Grief and Loss:** Counseling provides support and coping strategies.
    * **Eating Disorders:** CBT and family-based therapies are often used.
* **Biological Changes:** Research is increasingly showing that counseling can actually *change* brain structure and function. For example, CBT has been linked to changes in areas of the brain involved in anxiety and depression.


**2. Types of Counseling & Their Approaches:**

There's a *huge* variety of counseling approaches. Here are a few common ones:

* **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.  Very structured and goal-oriented.
* **Psychodynamic Therapy:** Explores unconscious patterns and past experiences to understand current behavior.
* **Humanistic Therapy (e.g., Person-Centered Therapy):** Emphasizes self-acceptance, personal growth, and creating a supportive therapeutic relationship.
* **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):** Focuses on accepting difficult thoughts and feelings and committing to values-based action.
* **Solution-Focused Therapy:**  Focuses on identifying solutions rather than dwelling on problems.
* **Family Systems Therapy:**  Views problems as arising within the family system.
* **Trauma-Focused Therapies (EMDR, TF-CBT):** Specifically designed to address the effects of traumatic experiences.

**3. Factors Influencing Effectiveness:**

* **Therapist-Client Relationship:** This is *critical*. A strong, trusting, and collaborative relationship is a key predictor of success.
* **Client Engagement:** Clients who are actively involved in the therapy process and are willing to make changes are more likely to benefit.
* **Therapeutic Alliance:**  This is a term used to describe the shared agreement between therapist and client.
* **Type of Problem:** Some problems are easier to treat than others.
* **Severity of Symptoms:** More severe symptoms often require longer-term therapy.
* **Client's Goals:**  Having clear goals for therapy increases the chances of success.
* **Therapist's Expertise & Training:**  Choosing a therapist with experience and training in treating your specific issue is important.

**4. What Counseling *Doesn't* Always Do:**

* **It's Not a Magic Cure:** Counseling is a process, and it takes time and effort.
* **It Doesn't Automatically Fix You:** You still have to be willing to work on yourself.
* **It Can Be Challenging:**  Talking about difficult things can be uncomfortable, but it’s a necessary part of the process.

**5. Resources for Finding a Therapist:**

* **Psychology Today Therapist Finder:** [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists)
* **Open Path Collective:** [https://openpathcollective.org/](https://openpathcollective.org/) (offers affordable therapy options)

**In conclusion:** Counseling is a valuable tool that can significantly improve people's lives. While it’s not a guaranteed fix, the evidence strongly suggests that it can be effective when approached with the right therapist, client commitment, and a willingness to engage in the process.

1432,"My mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back, and I can't seem to forgive her. I want to say that it's okay, but I can't. I feel like even if I did forgive her, I wouldn't be able to say it to her face.","How someone feels when they forgive another, is at peace with themselves and their understanding of what went wrong, who was responsible for what in the situation, and clarity on their own motivation, actions, emotions including pain, regret, resentment, sadness.These steps ideally allow a new door to open in order to develop new paths in the existing relationship or accept that this will not be possible due to either person's way of handling themselves.The long answer would be that you're not yet through with this process.I commend you on being truthful with yourself about yourself.You're on the right track by expecting to feel resolved when you've reached resolution, and not before.Finding patience with the unpredictable amount of time needed to thoroughly examine all the details of the incidents you mention, sometimes is a frustration of its own.Keep up your good work of knowing your own life.It is a worthwhile endeavor!","Okay, this is a really common and incredibly painful experience. It sounds like you're carrying a heavy weight, and it's completely understandable that you're struggling with forgiveness and the desire to express it to your mom. Let’s break this down and explore what you’re feeling and what you can do.

**Understanding What You're Feeling:**

* **Betrayal & Hurt:** It’s crucial to acknowledge the depth of the hurt you've experienced. Mistakes, especially those that feel like breaches of trust, can leave incredibly deep wounds. The feeling of betrayal is a natural response to feeling let down by someone you should be able to rely on.
* **The Desire to Heal, Not Just Forgive:** You're not just wanting to say ""it's okay."" You’re wanting to *heal*. Forgiveness isn’t about excusing the behavior; it’s about releasing the anger, resentment, and pain that’s holding *you* captive.
* **The Difficulty of Direct Communication:** You've identified a huge obstacle: you can't bring this to her face. This is often because the emotions are too raw, the fear of a negative reaction is too strong, or you're worried about re-opening old wounds. It’s a protective mechanism, which is perfectly valid.
* **The Weight of Unspoken Words:** The fact that you *want* to say it, but can’t, is adding to the emotional burden. It feels like a constant reminder of what you're missing.

**What You Can Do (Especially Since You Can't Say It to Her Face):**

1. **Acknowledge and Validate Your Feelings:** This is the *most* important step. Don’t try to suppress or minimize what you’re feeling. Journaling is a fantastic way to do this. Write down everything – the anger, the sadness, the confusion, the disappointment. Just let it flow.  Saying to yourself, ""It's okay that I feel this way. My feelings are valid because of what happened,"" can be a powerful starting point.

2. **Find a Safe Outlet for Expression:** Since you can’t talk to her, you need alternative ways to process your emotions. Here are some options:
   * **Journaling:** As mentioned above, this is your best friend right now.
   * **Creative Expression:**  Do you enjoy art, music, writing poetry, or anything creative? Channeling your emotions into a creative outlet can be incredibly therapeutic.
   * **Therapy:**  A therapist can provide a safe, non-judgmental space to explore your feelings and develop coping strategies. They can also help you understand the dynamics of your relationship with your mom.
   * **Trusted Friend or Family Member:**  If you have someone you trust implicitly, talking to them can provide support and perspective. (Be mindful of who you choose - someone who will understand without judgment.)

3. **Consider a Letter (You Don’t Have to Send It):** You don’t have to send this letter. It’s purely for you. Writing a letter to your mom, expressing everything you’re feeling, can be a powerful way to get it all out. You can say things you wouldn’t say to her face. This can be a way to create some distance and clarity.

4. **Focus on *Your* Healing:** Forgiveness, in this context, isn’t about her changing. It’s about *you* letting go of the emotional burden.  You can choose to accept what happened and move forward, regardless of whether she acknowledges her mistakes or apologizes.

5. **Small Steps:** Don't put pressure on yourself to ""forgive"" completely overnight. It’s a process, not an event. Celebrate small steps – acknowledging a feeling, writing a paragraph in your journal, or simply recognizing that you're working towards healing.

**Important Reminders:**

* **You Are Not Responsible for Her Feelings:** You are not responsible for how your mom reacts to your feelings. You are only responsible for your own healing.
* **Forgiveness Doesn’t Mean Excusing:** Forgiveness doesn't mean condoning her behavior. It’s about releasing the emotional hold it has on you.
* **It’s Okay to Take Time:** There’s no timeline for forgiveness. Do what feels right for *you*.

2856,"I’m in my early 20s. My ex’s parents are friends with them and have told them bad things about me. I left my ex due to an abusive situation, and they are making me look like I was the bad one.","Maybe you can talk with your partner about this first look at the different elements of a possible conversation in the future. If you are at a place where you are willing or able to disclose the reason that you left your ex, that could be one element of the discussion, but it doesn't have to be.I don't know how long we have been together with your current partner, but perhaps his or her parents would see you for who you are and make their own opinions over time. That may be a discussion to have with them as well.Hopefully your partner will be a good sounding board before these conversations.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling hurt, angry, and possibly confused. It's awful when people you thought were supportive are undermining you, especially when you're dealing with the aftermath of an abusive relationship. Let's break this down and figure out how to approach it.

**1. Validate Your Feelings:**

* **You are not wrong.** Seriously. The fact that your ex's parents are actively trying to paint you in a negative light after you left an abusive situation is incredibly hurtful and, frankly, disrespectful. It’s completely normal to feel betrayed, angry, and like no one believes you.
* **Their actions are a reflection of them, not you.** Their behavior stems from their own issues, possibly their discomfort with your ex's choices, or maybe even a misunderstanding of the situation. It’s not about you.
* **Don't internalize their negativity.** It's easy to start doubting yourself, but their words are designed to make you feel bad, not to reflect reality.

**2. Understanding Their Motivation (Without Excusing It):**

* **Possible Reasons (Don’t assume these are true, but consider them):**
    * **Protecting Their Child:** They might be genuinely trying to protect their child from further pain, but they’re doing so poorly.
    * **Discomfort with the Breakup:** Breakups are messy. They might be struggling to accept it and projecting their emotions onto you.
    * **Misinformation:** They might have a skewed understanding of the relationship and the abuse.
    * **Gossip/Drama:** Sadly, some people enjoy stirring up drama.
* **Recognize that they are likely not being truthful or objective.** Their perspective is colored by their own biases and emotions.

**3. What You Can Do (And What You Shouldn't):**

* **Limit Contact:** This is *crucial*.  The less you engage with them, the less ammunition they have to use against you.  Consider completely cutting them off if their behavior is consistently harmful.
* **Don’t Respond to Their Negativity:** This is incredibly difficult, but responding, even defensively, just fuels the fire.  They're likely trying to provoke a reaction.  Grey Rocking is a technique where you respond with minimal, neutral answers.  For example, if they say something untrue, you could simply say, ""Okay,"" and change the subject.
* **Document Everything:** Keep records of what they say – texts, emails, voicemails. This could be useful if things escalate or if you need to protect yourself legally (though it's unlikely, it’s always good to be prepared).
* **Talk to Someone You Trust:** Lean on supportive friends, family members, or a therapist.  Having someone to validate your experience and help you process your emotions is vital.
* **Focus on Your Healing:**  Prioritize your well-being.  Continue with your therapy (if you have it), engage in self-care activities, and surround yourself with people who believe in you.

**4. Addressing the Abuse (If You Haven’t Already):**

* **If you haven't already, seek professional help for the abuse.** This is incredibly important for your long-term healing.  A therapist can help you process the trauma and develop healthy coping mechanisms.
* **Remember your strength:** You left a dangerous situation. That takes incredible courage.  You are resilient, and you deserve to be treated with respect and compassion.

2096,How does a person start the counseling process?,"I'd recommend looking on psychologtoday.com, reading the bio's of potential therapists who you think you would relate best with, then contact them through e-mail or on the phone.","Okay, let's break down how a person starts the counseling process. It can feel daunting, but understanding the steps can make it feel much more manageable. Here's a breakdown, covering everything from initial thoughts to the first session:

**1. Recognizing the Need & Initial Exploration:**

* **Self-Reflection:** The first step is often realizing you *want* to explore something in your life – a feeling, a relationship issue, a life transition, a recurring thought pattern, etc.  This usually starts with some self-reflection. Ask yourself:
    * What's been bothering me?
    * What am I hoping to change?
    * What are my goals for therapy? (Even a vague idea is helpful)
    * What are my values? (Understanding your values can help guide your decisions and coping strategies.)
* **Researching Options:**  Start looking into different types of counseling. Common types include:
    * **Individual Therapy:**  Focuses on personal challenges and growth.
    * **Couples Therapy:** Addresses relationship issues.
    * **Family Therapy:**  Works with families to improve communication and resolve conflicts.
    * **Group Therapy:** Offers support and shared experiences with others facing similar challenges.
* **Understanding Different Therapists:** Research therapists who specialize in the area you need help with.  Look at their qualifications, experience, and therapeutic approach (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Psychodynamic Therapy, Humanistic Therapy).

**2. Finding a Therapist:**

* **Referrals:** This is often the easiest starting point.
    * **Ask your doctor:** They can often provide referrals to therapists in your network.
    * **Ask friends or family:** If you trust them, they might have recommendations.
    * **Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs):** Many employers offer free or low-cost counseling services through EAPs.
* **Online Directories:** These are great resources:
    * **Psychology Today:** [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) (Very comprehensive)
    * **GoodTherapy:** [https://www.goodtherapy.org/](https://www.goodtherapy.org/)
    * **Open Path Collective:** [https://openpathcollective.org/](https://openpathcollective.org/) (Offers affordable therapy options)
* **Insurance Provider’s Website:**  Check your insurance company’s website for a list of in-network providers.

**3. The Initial Contact (Phone Call):**

* **Scheduling a Consultation:** Most therapists offer a brief (15-30 minute) initial phone consultation. This is *your* opportunity to assess if they're a good fit.
* **What to Discuss on the Call:**
    * **Briefly explain what you’re hoping to address in therapy.**  You don't need to go into great detail. Just a general overview.
    * **Ask about their experience and approach.**  ""Do you have experience working with [your specific issue]?"" “What is your therapeutic style?""
    * **Inquire about fees, insurance, and appointment availability.**
    * **Ask about their policies:**  Cancellation policies, confidentiality, etc.
    * **Trust your gut:** Do you feel comfortable talking to this person? Do you feel heard and understood?

**4. The First Session – What to Expect:**

* **Building Rapport:** The first session is primarily about building a relationship between you and the therapist. It’s not about solving all your problems.
* **The Therapist Will:**
    * **Gather Information:** They’ll ask you questions about your background, your current situation, your goals for therapy, and your reasons for seeking help.  Be honest and open – this is a safe space.
    * **Explain the Therapeutic Process:** They’ll explain their approach to therapy and what you can expect over time.
    * **Set Goals:** You’ll start to collaboratively define some initial goals for therapy.
* **You’ll:**
    * **Share (at your pace):**  Start with what feels comfortable. You don't have to reveal everything at once.
    * **Ask Questions:** Don't hesitate to ask any questions you have about the process.
    * **Be Prepared to Talk About Your Feelings:**  Therapy is about exploring your emotions.

**Important Considerations:**

* **It’s Okay to “Shop Around”:**  It’s perfectly acceptable to meet with a few different therapists before finding one you connect with. Finding the right fit is crucial.
* **Don’t Be Afraid to Change Therapists:** If you don’t feel like you’re making progress or if you don't feel comfortable with your therapist, it’s okay to seek someone else.
* **Therapy Takes Time and Effort:**  It's not a quick fix. Be patient with yourself and the process.

To help me give you even more tailored advice, could you tell me:

*   What kind of challenges are you currently facing that are making you consider counseling? (You don’t have to go into detail, just a general idea – e.g., anxiety, relationship problems, grief, depression, etc.)",0.48239457607269287
1637,"I find that I imagine things sexually, and I hate it because it puts strain on my relationship. I feel helpless and guilty. I want it to go away, and I want to make my woman happy again.","It is completely understandable that you would like to find a way to make these intrusive thoughts go away, however, your feeling that you can't control having these thoughts is accurate. It's also understandable that you would feel helpless and guilty, given that you see how these thoughts are effecting your relationship, though I would encourage you to go easy on yourself and remember that you aren't choosing to have these thoughts. I'm sure that if there was a switch to turn them off, you would flip it.There is no magic technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away, however, therapy may still have a lot to offer. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into where these thoughts are coming from and develop new ways of relating to them so that they do not leave you feeling as helpless and guilty and can be more present with your partner. Though there is no guarantee that the thoughts will go away, this may also be a result of work with a therapist. Either way, you may be able to find a way to deal with the thoughts and show up in your relationship in a way that will be satisfying to you and your partner.","Okay, let's address this. What you're experiencing is incredibly common, and the fact that it's causing you distress and impacting your relationship is a really important thing to acknowledge and work through. It takes a lot of courage to talk about this, and you’ve already taken a huge first step by recognizing the problem and wanting to fix it. Let's break this down and explore some ways to approach this, focusing on both your feelings and your relationship.

**1. Understanding What's Happening – It's More Common Than You Think**

* **Random Thoughts Are Normal:**  The human brain is wired to imagine all sorts of things, and sexual imagery is a natural part of that. It doesn't automatically mean you're a bad person or that you want to harm your relationship.  The *frequency* and *intensity* of these thoughts are what matter.
* **Causes Can Be Complex:** These intrusive thoughts can be triggered by a wide range of things – stress, anxiety, past experiences, even just a fleeting image or thought. Sometimes they're linked to unresolved emotions or fantasies. It's rarely about a deep-seated desire to act on them.
* **Guilt is a Response, Not the Problem:** The guilt you're feeling is a natural reaction to experiencing something that feels uncomfortable or out of alignment with your values.  Don’t beat yourself up for having the thoughts; focus on how you’re *responding* to them.

**2. What You Can Do – Strategies for Managing the Thoughts**

* **Don't Fight the Thoughts (Initially):**  Trying to suppress or push down these thoughts often makes them stronger.  Instead, try to acknowledge them without judgment.  Think of it like observing a cloud passing in the sky – you notice it's there, but you don’t try to stop it.
* **Thought Stopping:**  When you notice a disturbing thought, consciously say ""Stop!"" (either silently or out loud) and immediately shift your focus to something completely different – a mental math problem, a sensory experience (look around you, really *see* things), or a positive affirmation.
* **Reframing:**  When you have a thought, try to consciously reframe it.  Instead of focusing on the disturbing imagery, think about the *feeling* behind the thought. What is it trying to tell you?  Is it a need for connection, excitement, or something else?
* **Grounding Techniques:** If you're feeling overwhelmed, grounding techniques can help bring you back to the present moment. Examples:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
* **Increase Positive Focus:**  Actively cultivate positive experiences – spend time with your partner doing things you both enjoy, pursue hobbies, practice gratitude.

**3. Talking to Your Partner – A Delicate Conversation**

This is arguably the most crucial part, and it needs to be handled with sensitivity and honesty.

* **Choose the Right Time:** Don't bring this up in the heat of an argument or when you're both stressed. Choose a calm, private time when you can both talk openly.
* **Start with Vulnerability:**  ""I want to talk to you about something that’s been bothering me, and I want you to know that I care deeply about you and our relationship.""
* **Focus on Your Feelings and Your Actions:**  Frame it as *your* struggle, not as something *she* did to cause it.  For example: “I’ve been experiencing some intrusive thoughts that are distressing me, and I want to be open with you about it. It’s not about you at all; I’m struggling to manage these thoughts, and it’s making me feel really guilty and anxious.”
* **Don’t Overshare Initially:** You don't need to describe the specific imagery.  Focus on the impact it's having on you and your relationship.  “I want to be honest with you about this, and I’m working on it. I value our connection so much, and I want to make sure I’m being the best partner I can be.”
* **Reassure Her:**  Make it clear that your feelings for her are genuine and that you’re committed to your relationship.
* **Be Prepared for Her Reaction:** She might be confused, hurt, or concerned. Allow her to express her feelings and respond with empathy.

**4. Seeking Professional Support**

* **Therapy is a Powerful Tool:** A therapist can provide you with strategies for managing intrusive thoughts, exploring the underlying causes, and improving your communication skills. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is often very effective for this type of issue.
* **Individual Therapy:** This can help you process your feelings, develop coping mechanisms, and address any underlying anxiety or stress.
* **Couples Therapy:** Can help you and your partner improve your communication, resolve conflict, and strengthen your connection.

1228,"I am a female, and I am afraid of having sex. I am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced. I think he thinks I'm not a virgin. I am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body. I don't want my partner to think differently of me because I am afraid of having sex.","As hard as it may be to do this, since all the media and marketing of how an ideal person looks and performs sexually, surrounds us, keep in mind that the images presented in order to sell movies and almost any product, is meant to trigger fantasies.No one is a fantasy, we are all real and unique.  We can be influenced to believe that being a fantasy is better than being who each of us is, genuinely.Your partner may be much more accepting of your body and your level of sexual experience, than you are of yourself!Sex within a relationship means the two people want to have with the other one, not because they have ideal bodies and expertise, but because the person wants to make love to the one whom they love.When you are in a loving relationship, part of this includes talking about sensitivities and insecurities.  Having a conversation gives the chance to know that you are accepted for who you are, not how closely you resemble a made up idea meant to persuade people to buy items.","Okay, this is a really brave thing to acknowledge and share. It's incredibly common to experience these kinds of anxieties around sex, especially when there's a fear of judgment or feeling inadequate. Let's break down what you're feeling and explore some ways to cope. It sounds like you're grappling with a complex mix of fears: fear of disappointing your partner, fear of being perceived as not a virgin, and a general fear of vulnerability and judgment regarding your body.

**1. Understanding Your Fears:**

* **The Pressure of Expectations:** You’ve identified a key element – the pressure you feel to meet your partner’s expectations. It’s completely understandable to feel anxious about this, especially if you're feeling insecure about your experience. Many people feel pressure to ""perform"" sexually, and that can be incredibly overwhelming.
* **The Virginity Myth:** The idea of virginity is often a very unrealistic and socially constructed concept. It’s important to recognize that it's not a measure of a person's worth or desirability. Focusing on this fear can actually create more anxiety.
* **Body Image and Vulnerability:**  You're understandably sensitive about your body and feeling exposed. This is a completely normal human reaction. Feeling vulnerable can trigger anxiety, and it's okay to acknowledge that.
* **Fear of Disappointment (in yourself and others):**  You're worried about letting yourself down and about your partner’s reaction. This is a core fear, and it’s important to address it.

**2. Communication is Key:**

* **Talk to Your Partner:** This is the *most* important step. You need to be able to openly and honestly communicate your anxieties to him. You can start by saying something like: ""I really care about you, and I want us to have a wonderful intimate experience. I’ve been struggling with some anxieties around sex, and I want to talk about them so we can both feel comfortable and happy.""
* **Be Specific:** Instead of saying ""I'm scared,"" tell him *what* you're afraid of. “I’m a little nervous because I haven't had a lot of experience, and I worry about you feeling like I’m not meeting your expectations.” or “I’m feeling a little vulnerable when I think about being naked, and I want to talk about how we can make that feel more comfortable for both of us.”
* **Validate His Feelings Too:**  Ask him how *he* feels about intimacy and what his expectations are. Understanding his perspective can help you both feel more secure.

**3. Addressing Your Anxiety:**

* **Challenge Negative Thoughts:** When you notice yourself having negative thoughts (""He'll think I'm not good enough,"" ""I'm going to embarrass myself""), try to challenge them. Ask yourself: ""Is this thought realistic? Is it helpful? What’s the worst that could actually happen?""
* **Focus on Connection, Not Performance:** Shift your focus from ""performing"" to enjoying the connection with your partner.  Intimacy is about closeness, affection, and mutual pleasure, not about meeting some arbitrary standard.
* **Start Slowly:** Don't feel pressured to rush into anything. Begin with activities that feel comfortable for you – cuddling, kissing, sensual massage, talking intimately.  Gradually build your comfort level.
* **Grounding Techniques:** If you feel overwhelmed with anxiety, use grounding techniques like deep breathing, mindfulness, or focusing on your senses to bring yourself back to the present moment.

**4. Self-Compassion:**

* **Be Kind to Yourself:** You're dealing with a vulnerable emotion. Treat yourself with the same compassion and understanding you would offer a friend.
* **Recognize Your Worth:** Your value as a person isn't determined by your sexual experience. You are worthy of love and connection regardless.

**5. Seeking Professional Support:**

* **Therapy:**  A therapist can provide a safe space to explore your anxieties, develop coping mechanisms, and build self-confidence.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) are often helpful for anxiety.
* **Sex Therapist:** A sex therapist specializes in addressing sexual concerns and can provide tailored guidance.

501,"I never feel like myself. I can’t even think straight anymore. I start stuttering and I can’t remember anything. I always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with, what feels like, someone else. I don’t know why I feel this way, but I hate it.","What you are describing sounds like it may be a form of dissociation. Dissociation is our mind's way of disconnecting us from aspects of our experience in an attempt to protect us in overwhelming situations. It also sounds like you are noticing anxiety in certain situations. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into these experiences, learn skills for coping with anxiety and reconnecting with yourself, and alleviate these symptoms over time.","Okay, thank you for sharing this with me. It takes a lot of courage to talk about feeling this way, and I want you to know I hear you and I'm here to listen. What you're describing – the feeling of disconnect, the difficulty thinking clearly, the stuttering, memory problems, overwhelming nervousness, and the fighting with yourself (and seemingly others) – sounds incredibly distressing and confusing. It’s completely understandable that you hate it.

It sounds like you're experiencing a significant shift in how you feel and function, and that's a serious thing to acknowledge. Let's break this down a bit and explore some potential avenues.  It’s important to emphasize that I'm an AI and can't diagnose you, but I can offer some perspectives and suggestions.

**Here’s what’s happening and what we can consider:**

* **What you're describing is a complex issue:** The combination of symptoms – cognitive difficulties, emotional distress, and behavioral changes – suggests something deeper than just a temporary bad day. It could be related to a variety of things.
* **Possible Causes (These are just possibilities – a professional needs to assess):**
    * **Anxiety:**  The nervousness, stuttering, and fighting with yourself are strong indicators of anxiety. It's possible you're experiencing heightened anxiety, perhaps triggered by something specific or developing over time.
    * **Depression:** Difficulty thinking clearly, memory problems, and feeling disconnected are common symptoms of depression.
    * **Stress:**  Significant life stressors (work, relationships, finances, etc.) can manifest in these ways.
    * **Trauma:** Past trauma can significantly impact cognitive function, emotional regulation, and behavior.
    * **Physical Health:**  Sometimes, underlying medical conditions (thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, neurological issues) can contribute to these symptoms.
    * **Medications:** Are you taking any medications that could be causing side effects?
* **The ""Fighting with Someone Else"":** This is a really key detail. It suggests a struggle within yourself – a conflict between your thoughts, feelings, and actions. This often happens when there's underlying distress.

**What You Can Do Right Now:**

1. **Talk to Someone You Trust:**  Sharing this with a trusted friend, family member, or partner can provide support and a listening ear.
2. **Reach Out for Professional Help:** **This is the most important step.**  You absolutely need to speak with a mental health professional. Here are some options:
    * **Therapist/Counselor:** A therapist can help you explore the underlying causes of your feelings and develop coping strategies.
    * **Psychiatrist:** A psychiatrist can diagnose mental health conditions and prescribe medication if needed.
    * **Psychologist:**  A psychologist can provide therapy and conduct psychological testing.
    * **Your Primary Care Physician:** They can rule out any underlying medical conditions and refer you to a specialist.

927,"My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the ""straight and narrow"" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that I'm not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others.    His insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","You are right that his insecurities are at the root of the issue.  You cannot change that for him.  He will have to do the work to handle those emotions on his own.  What you can do is reassure him in whatever ways possible, but always recognizing that you can't ""fix"" this for him.  When I work with people who struggle with their partner's past experiences, I always frame it like this:  Everything that you've experienced has resulted in you being the person you are today.  The person they claim to love.  If you had not gone through some of those experiences, you would not be in the position you're in now, ready to commit to him and know that you're satisfied with that.  Just as when bad things happen to us, we have to find a way to appreciate the lessons learned your fiance has to accept that you're the person you are today because of what you have gone through.  Celebrate that you have moved through that and have landed in this perfect position with him!Hope that helps, Allison","Okay, this is a really common and incredibly challenging situation, and it's fantastic that you recognize the impact it's having on your relationship. It's great you're seeking advice and want to understand how to support him. Let's break this down and explore some strategies.

**1. Understanding His Perspective (and Validating It)**

* **His Insecurities are the Core:** You're right to identify his insecurities as the root. His difficulty accepting your past is almost certainly fueled by deeper feelings of inadequacy, shame, or a fear of not measuring up to some internal standard. He likely feels judged, and that judgment might be self-inflicted.
* **His Past Matters Too:** It’s important to acknowledge his own struggles.  He’s likely carrying his own baggage.  Don’t minimize his feelings; even if his past looks different, it’s still a part of who he is.
* **The Virginity Issue - It's Not Just About Sex:** For him, the lack of virginity might represent a perceived failure to live up to a specific ideal or expectation, even if that expectation isn't a universally held one. It could be tied to his feelings of not being ""good enough.""

**2. How to Respond to Him – Communication is Key**

* **Empathy, Not Just Reassurance:** Don’t just say “It’s okay, it doesn’t matter.” While reassurance is helpful, it doesn’t address the underlying issue. Instead, try phrases like:
    * ""I understand this is hard for you, and I see you're feeling judged.""
    * ""It makes sense that you're struggling with this, and I want to help you feel more at peace.”
    * “I know this is a sensitive topic for you, and I appreciate you sharing this with me.”
* **Validate His Feelings:** “It sounds like you're feeling really insecure about yourself, and that’s understandable.”
* **Share Your Own Vulnerabilities (Carefully):** Gently sharing your own past struggles (if you're comfortable) can create a sense of shared humanity. ""I know I've had my own moments of doubt and making mistakes. It’s part of being human, and I’ve learned a lot from them.” *However, be careful not to make it about you.* The focus should remain on *him*.
* **Set Boundaries (Respectfully):** While you want to be supportive, you also have a right to be treated with respect. If the conversation becomes overly critical or judgmental, you can say, ""I hear you, but I'm not comfortable with this level of criticism. Can we talk about something else?""

**3. Helping Him Live in the Present**

* **Focus on the Future:** Gently steer conversations towards your shared goals, dreams, and the future you're building together. ""I'm so excited about [plan you have together]. Let's talk about how we can make that happen.""
* **Highlight His Strengths:**  Remind him of the positive qualities you admire in him. “I love how kind you are,” “I appreciate your sense of humor,” “You’re such a loyal friend.”  Genuine affirmation can help boost his self-esteem.
* **Small Acts of Service & Connection:**  Spend quality time together doing things he enjoys.  Small gestures of affection and appreciation can rebuild connection.
* **Encourage Self-Care:**  Suggest activities that might help him build self-esteem – exercise, hobbies, spending time with supportive friends.

**4. Suggesting Professional Help (This is Crucial)**

* **Therapy is a Gift:** Seriously, this is the most important step. His insecurities are significant, and a therapist can provide him with the tools he needs to process them in a healthy way. Suggest couples therapy *and* individual therapy for him.
    * **Couples Therapy:** Can help you both learn to communicate more effectively and navigate this difficult dynamic.
    * **Individual Therapy:**  Will allow him to explore the root causes of his insecurities and develop coping mechanisms.
* **Frame it Positively:** ""I want us to have the strongest possible relationship, and I believe talking to a therapist could really help us both grow and feel more secure.”

**5. Important Considerations for You**

* **Self-Care:** Supporting someone with deep-seated insecurities can be emotionally draining. Make sure you're taking care of your own needs and setting boundaries.
* **Don't Take It Personally:** His reactions are about *him*, not about you. His insecurities are not a reflection of your worth.
* **Assess Your Boundaries:**  How much are you willing to accept?  If his behavior becomes consistently disrespectful or damaging, you need to consider whether this relationship is sustainable.

196,"How do I make myself happy without the people who made me happy? Now that they’re gone, I feel sad. It’s been two months now but I seem to be unable to stay okay and independent.","It sounds like you have been feeling pretty down, since the loss of a relationship, and you're wondering how to be happy by yourself. Intimacy is a very natural human desire and at the same time learning to enjoy ourselves, even when we are alone, can strengthen our ability to lead a satisfying life in and out of relationship. Working with a therapist, you may be able to gain insight into how you show up in your relationships with yourself and others and discover more fulfilling ways to do so.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge it and reach out for help. It's completely understandable that you're feeling sad and struggling with independence after losing people who brought you joy. Two months is a significant amount of time, and grief, even if it's not the traditional kind, can be a slow and persistent process. Let’s break this down and explore some ways to navigate this.

**1. Acknowledge and Validate Your Feelings:**

* **It's Okay to Be Sad:** Seriously, it *is*. Don’t beat yourself up for still feeling sad. Grief isn’t a timeline; it’s a feeling that ebbs and flows.  Allow yourself to feel the sadness, anger, disappointment, or whatever comes up. Suppressing it will only make it harder in the long run.
* **Name the Feelings:**  Instead of just feeling ""bad,"" try to identify *what* you're feeling.  Are you feeling lonely?  Empty?  Like something is missing?  Naming the emotion gives you more power over it.
* **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be incredibly helpful.  Don't censor yourself; just let it flow. It's a safe space to process your emotions.


**2. Rebuilding Your Happiness - Starting Small:**

* **Focus on Yourself (For Now):** Since the people who made you happy are gone, you need to become your own source of joy. This doesn’t mean ignoring the loss, but it means shifting your focus to what *you* can do to feel better.
* **Rediscover Old Interests:** What did you enjoy doing before?  Is there a hobby you’ve neglected?  Start small – even 15-30 minutes a day can make a difference.  Painting, reading, gardening, playing an instrument, cooking… anything that sparks even a little interest.
* **Try New Things:** This can be scary, but it can also be incredibly rewarding.  Take a class, join a club, volunteer, learn a new skill.  This helps you expand your world and meet new people (eventually, when you're ready).
* **Small Daily Rituals:** Create small, positive rituals for yourself. This could be making a nice cup of tea, taking a walk, listening to music, or practicing gratitude.
* **Self-Care is Non-Negotiable:** Prioritize your physical and mental well-being.  Eat healthy, get enough sleep, exercise (even a little bit), and practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation.

**3. Addressing the Independence Struggle:**

* **It's Normal to Need Support:** It's completely normal to feel like you need support after a significant loss, especially when it's from people you relied on. Don't feel like you need to be completely independent right away.
* **Start with Small Tasks:** Instead of trying to tackle huge projects, break them down into smaller, more manageable steps.
* **Reach Out (Strategically):** You mentioned they made you happy.  Do you still have *some* connection with them?  A brief, thoughtful message might be okay, but don’t expect them to immediately 'fix' your sadness.  Focus on *your* healing.
* **Build a Support Network (Eventually):** This will take time. Start by connecting with people who share your interests.  A local club, volunteer organization, or online community can be a good starting point.

**4. Seeking Professional Support – This is Crucial:**

* **Therapy is Highly Recommended:**  A therapist can provide you with a safe space to process your grief, develop coping mechanisms, and address any underlying issues that might be contributing to your struggle.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) can be particularly helpful for grief and building resilience.
* **Where to Find Therapy:**
    * **Your Primary Care Physician:** They can often provide referrals.
    * **Online Therapy Platforms:** (Talkspace, BetterHelp, Amwell) – These can be more accessible and affordable.
    * **University Counseling Centers:** If you're a student.
    * **Community Mental Health Centers:** Often offer low-cost services.


**Important Reminders:**

* **Be Patient with Yourself:** Healing takes time. There will be good days and bad days. Don’t get discouraged if you have setbacks.
* **Don’t Compare Yourself to Others:** Everyone grieves differently. What works for one person may not work for another.
* **Focus on Progress, Not Perfection:** Celebrate small victories.

940,"I'm a young adult woman, and I have trouble finding my true identity being at home. This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I don't know why. I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldn't like it. My parents are very religious—they're Christians. We did things every time he'd come over to my house. We didn't have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we'd watch movies by ourselves.
   One day, my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. As soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. They were both aggravated. They told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. They said he wanted me for sex and he's not a Christian. I took their advice and broke up with him. Once we broke up for about a month, I decided to get back together with him a little after school started. My parents found out eventually, and I decided to not listen this time. I would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and God totally forbids him. I would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually I would just never listen to my parents. They're always yelling at me about how I shouldn't date this boy. I felt too old to listen to them. Now I'm kind of just stuck. Is the real me religious? Have I been brainwashed by him? I don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think I'm deceiving because of it. They threatened me that if I'm still with him, I can't do track and they won't support me. They've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. They say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. I'm actually very happy with him. They also say I'm living a separate life at home than I am at school. They say they want what's best for me and love me because they adopted me.","What a tough situation you must be in, feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you. I would say the first thing you want to do is (if you haven't already), have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents, telling them how you feel and letting them know what you need from them. If communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward. You, unfortunately, will not be able to change your parent's feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from the relationship you have with your parents. It always helps to try and see things from another angle. You might want to, for example, try and understand your parent's perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset. Validating other's feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively. Are you living with your parents and do they support you? If so, are you willing to give that up should you decide to not follow their rules? Know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply. Your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper. Not everyone will always approve of the choices we make and sometimes we need to be okay with that. Best of luck to you.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling lost and confused. What you're experiencing is a complex mix of guilt, shame, anger, and a deep desire for autonomy – all amplified by the intense pressure from your parents. Let's break down what's happening and explore some ways to navigate this.

**1. Understanding the Roots of Your Feelings:**

* **Guilt & Shame:** The guilt you’re feeling is a natural response to a situation that challenged your values and beliefs. It’s amplified by the judgment you’re receiving. Don’t beat yourself up – it’s a complicated situation with layers.
* **Identity Crisis:** You're asking a really important question: “Is the real me religious?” This is a core issue. The experience, combined with your parents' reaction, has shaken your foundation. It’s okay to question what you believe and how you want to live. It’s also completely normal to feel like you're being pulled in different directions.
* **Brainwashing?** The term “brainwashed” is loaded, but it’s understandable why you feel that way. Your parents' intense reaction, combined with your boyfriend's influence, created a dynamic where you felt pressured and perhaps manipulated. It’s not necessarily about him “brainwashing” you, but about the environment you were in and how it shaped your thinking.
* **Your Boyfriend's Role:** He’s undoubtedly part of the picture, but it’s crucial to recognize that your parents' reaction is a primary driver of your distress.

**2. Addressing Your Parents’ Behavior:**

* **Their Reaction is Extreme:** What your parents are doing is incredibly unhealthy. Calling you a ""slut"" and a ""devil worshipper"" is abusive and damaging. Their threats about track and their overall controlling behavior are manipulative and designed to punish you.
* **They're Not Acting Out of Love:** While they may *say* they love you, their behavior demonstrates a lack of respect for your autonomy and your choices. Their actions are rooted in their own rigid beliefs and fear.
* **You Don't Need to Just ""Stop Talking"":** Cutting off communication entirely isn’t a solution. It allows them to continue to control the narrative. You need to set boundaries, even if it’s difficult.

**3. Finding Your Own Truth:**

* **Explore Your Values:** This is a chance to really define *your* values, not just the ones your parents hold. Take some time for introspection. What’s important to you? What kind of person do you want to be?
* **Question Your Beliefs:** It's okay to challenge the religious beliefs you were raised with. You don't have to accept everything your parents believe.
* **Your Happiness Matters:** You mentioned you're happy with your boyfriend. That's a valid and important thing to acknowledge. Don't let their judgment overshadow your own feelings.
* **Track & Your Future:** You're right to be concerned about track. It’s a valuable part of your life. You can try to communicate your desire to continue pursuing it, but understand that your parents’ reaction might limit your options.

**4. What You Can Do:**

* **Seek Support:** This is crucial. Talk to a therapist or counselor. They can provide a safe space for you to process your emotions, develop healthy coping mechanisms, and navigate this challenging family dynamic. A therapist can help you understand your parents' behavior and develop strategies for setting boundaries.
* **Start Small with Boundaries:**  You don't have to confront them immediately. Start with small steps, like politely stating, ""I appreciate your concerns, but I'm making my own decisions.""
* **Focus on Your Wellbeing:** Prioritize your mental and emotional health. Engage in activities you enjoy, spend time with supportive friends, and practice self-care.

**Important Note:** You were adopted, and your parents’ actions are particularly concerning given that dynamic. It’s okay to feel a deep sense of betrayal and confusion.

2256,"I have been with my best friend for over a year, and we have had a beautiful baby girl. We were in love, and I still love her dearly. I am in my late teens and so is she. She says she has lost her connection with me. She is talking to a random guy that she says is just someone to talk to. But she says she still loves me. I'm very hurt and confused.","Congrats on having your daughter!Have you told your partner about your feelings of ""hurt and confused""?This is one possible way of opening a conversation about the different ways you each feel about one another and whether either of you would like changing or continuing to live together, in light of the change in emotional connection.The first step of having a dialogue about a relationship is being clear on what you are feeling, what you are willing to contribute to the relationship and what you would like having in return from your partner.Ask your partner if she is willing to have a conversation on these topics.  Then, allow some time so each of you is clear about their own expectations and what is possible to offer the other.This is a fairly complex process and very often is difficult to keep on track without outside help to keep the discussion focused.It is normal for emotions to override our logic when discussing matters we care about deeply.If the conversations don't go very far, or if your partner has no interest in talking, stick with your own interest to more fully understand matters.Interview some therapists to find one whom you feel helps you clarify and find direction for yourself about this situation.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it’s completely understandable that you're feeling incredibly hurt and confused. You've built a beautiful life with your best friend, you're a new parent together, and now you're facing a sudden shift in her feelings and behavior. Let's break this down and explore what might be happening and how you can approach it.

**1. Understanding Her Perspective (As Much As You Can)**

* **Teenage Feelings are Intense and Fluid:** At 17 or 18, people are going through immense changes – hormonal shifts, identity exploration, and a huge desire for independence. Her feelings are likely very real, but also potentially volatile and not fully formed. It's possible she's grappling with feelings she doesn't fully understand herself.
* **The ""Someone to Talk To"" is a Common Phase:**  The need for a new connection, especially when feeling isolated or uncertain, is incredibly common in this age group. It doesn't automatically mean she's rejecting you, but it *does* indicate she's seeking something different right now.  It's a natural desire to have someone to share things with, someone who ""gets"" her, and that person might not be you.
* **She's Saying She Still Loves You:**  This is the most painful part.  ""Love"" is a complex emotion, and what it means at 17 might be different than what you both understand it to be at this stage of your relationship.  She might be using the word ""love"" to describe a deep friendship and connection, which is valid, but it doesn't necessarily translate to romantic love.

**2. What You’re Feeling is Valid**

* **It’s Okay to Be Hurt:** Don’t minimize your feelings. It's completely normal to feel devastated, confused, insecure, and even angry. Allow yourself to feel these emotions. Suppressing them will only make things worse.
* **You Have a Right to Be Confident in Your Feelings:** You've invested a year in this relationship, you were in love, and you still feel that way. That’s a significant investment and it's okay to want to protect that.
* **You’re Valid in Your Concerns:** It's natural to worry about the future of your relationship and the impact of her talking to someone else.

**3. What You Can Do – Communication and Boundaries**

* **Have an Open and Honest Conversation (When You're Both Calm):**  This is *crucial*.  Don't approach this when you're overwhelmed with emotion.  Choose a time when you can both talk calmly and without distractions.  Start by expressing how *you* feel.  For example: ""I've been feeling really hurt and confused because you've said you've lost your connection with me, and you're talking to someone else. I still love you and value our relationship, but I need to understand what's going on.""
* **Ask Her Directly About Her Feelings:**  Instead of accusing, try to understand.  “Can you help me understand what you’re feeling when you say you’ve lost our connection?  What needs aren’t being met for you in our relationship?”
* **Set Boundaries (Gently but Firmly):**  You have the right to know who she's talking to and how often.  You can say something like, “I’m comfortable with you having other friends, but I need to know who you’re spending time with and how often. It’s important for me to feel like I’m part of your life.”  You don't need to control her, but you do need to feel secure.
* **Don’t Try to “Win” Her Over:**  Competing with another person will only push her further away. Focus on being the best version of yourself and nurturing the connection you *do* have.

**4. Important Considerations & Next Steps**

* **This Might Not Be About You:**  Sometimes, a shift in feelings is about *her* internal journey, not necessarily a reflection of how she feels about you.
* **Consider Couples Counseling (If Possible):** If you're both willing, a therapist could provide a neutral space to communicate and work through these challenges.
* **Take Care of Yourself:** This is a stressful situation. Prioritize your own well-being – eat healthy, exercise, spend time with supportive people, and engage in activities you enjoy.

1621,I have several issues like I don't like people. They make me sick. I have issues with talking to people. I feel like they are talking about me and making fun of me. I have felt this way for years. When I look people in the eyes I have voices that tell me to hurt them and if I don't stop looking at who I am talking to it gets so loud I can't hear what they are saying. I just stay away from people to avoid this. I look at people and think how I could hurt them. I feel like I am worthless and would be better off not in this world where I don't fit in. Every day I wake up it's like another day. Any info would be good.,"Sounds like you are dealing with a lot within your self which is causing you great pain.  I would suggest that first you get a full physical evaluation to make sure that you are ok physically.  Then getting a mental evaluation as well from a psychiatrist.  Seeing both would help rule out any physically or psychologically causes to your symptoms.    After getting these evaluations, your physician should be able to help guide you on what treatments would be the best to help with your everyday challenges your are facing.  Whether treatment includes medication and/or psychotherapist would be discussed.  Please consider doing both immediately so you can have the live you want everyday you wake up.","Okay, thank you so much for sharing this with me. It takes incredible courage to talk about these feelings, and I want you to know I’m here to listen and provide information. What you’re describing sounds incredibly distressing and overwhelming, and it’s clear this has been a long-standing and difficult experience for you. It’s important to acknowledge that what you’re experiencing is real, and you don’t deserve to feel this way.

Let’s break down what you’ve shared and explore some potential explanations and steps you can take. **I want to be very clear: I am an AI and cannot diagnose or treat you. However, what you’re describing aligns with symptoms that could be associated with several mental health conditions, and seeking professional help is absolutely crucial.**

**Understanding What You're Experiencing:**

* **Social Anxiety:** This is a very common condition where intense fear and anxiety arise in social situations. It can manifest in many ways you've described – the feeling of being judged, the negative thoughts about others, the physical symptoms like racing heart and difficulty speaking. The voices you hear are often related to catastrophic thinking – imagining the worst possible outcome.
* **Paranoia:** The feeling of being watched, judged, or that others are talking about you can be a symptom of paranoia. This can range from mild suspicion to more intense beliefs.
* **Negative Thought Patterns:** The feeling of worthlessness and the belief that it would be better off not being in this world are signs of deep-seated negative thought patterns. These patterns can be incredibly powerful and difficult to break on your own.
* **Voices:** Experiencing voices, especially those with harmful intentions, can be a complex symptom. It can be related to anxiety, psychosis (a break from reality), or other underlying conditions.
* **Avoidance:** Your tendency to avoid people is understandable, but it can also reinforce the anxiety and make it harder to overcome.

**What You Can Do – Immediate Steps:**

1. **Talk to a Professional:** This is the *most* important step. Please, please reach out to a mental health professional. Here are some options:
   * **Therapist/Counselor:** A therapist can help you understand the root causes of your anxiety, develop coping mechanisms, and challenge negative thought patterns. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) are often very effective for anxiety.
   * **Psychiatrist:** A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who can diagnose mental health conditions and prescribe medication if needed.
   * **Psychologist:** A psychologist can provide therapy and conduct psychological testing.

    * **The Trevor Project:** 1-866-488-7386 (for LGBTQ youth) – [https://www.thetrevorproject.org/](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/)

2. **Start Small:**  You don’t have to suddenly immerse yourself in social situations. Begin with very small steps:
   * **Spend time alone:**  Focus on activities you enjoy and that make you feel comfortable.
   * **Brief Interactions:**  Start with brief, low-pressure interactions – a smile to a cashier, a simple ""hello"" to a neighbor.
   * **Gradual Exposure:**  Slowly and gradually increase your exposure to social situations, starting with things that feel manageable.

3. **Challenge Negative Thoughts:**  When you have those thoughts about being judged or that you could hurt someone, try to challenge them. Ask yourself:
   * ""Is there any real evidence for this thought?""
   * ""Am I jumping to conclusions?""
   * ""What’s a more balanced way of looking at this situation?""

4. **Self-Care:**  Prioritize activities that help you relax and manage stress:
   * **Relaxation Techniques:**  Deep breathing, meditation, yoga.
   * **Healthy Diet:**  Nourishing your body can impact your mood.
   * **Regular Sleep:**  Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.

**Important Note About the Voices:**  The voices you’re hearing are a serious symptom. It’s vital to get them evaluated by a mental health professional to determine the underlying cause.  They could be related to anxiety, but they could also be a sign of a more complex condition.

**Resources for More Information:**

* **NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness):** [https://www.nami.org/](https://www.nami.org/) – Offers information, support, and advocacy for individuals and families affected by mental illness.

2674,"Last year, I just always felt hopeless. I don't have a great relationship with my sister. I lost my mother recently, and that really added to my sadness. My sister always brings up how I was never close to my mother.","Wow what a painful journey you have been in for a long time. Death and grief bring up so many painful reminders of relationships--what they could have been, never were, and what was lost. With death of a family member the family often falls apart for a while... or longer. I hope you can find some support for you and your pain that was occurring before your mom's passing. I also hope you can find someone to help you set boundaries with your sister so you can have your time (as long as you need) to heal from losing your mom and then later figure out how to interact with your sister. ","Okay, that sounds like an incredibly difficult time for you. It's completely understandable that you're feeling hopeless, given the layers of grief you're carrying – the loss of your mother, and the added weight of your sister's comments. It takes a huge amount of strength to even acknowledge these feelings, so I want to acknowledge that you're doing okay just by recognizing this and reaching out.

Let’s break this down a bit. It sounds like you're dealing with a complex mix of emotions and challenging relationships. Here's what I hear, and some thoughts about how you might be feeling and what you could potentially do:

**Understanding Your Feelings:**

* **Grief is Complex:** Losing a parent is a profound loss, and grief isn’t a linear process. It’s okay to feel hopeless, sad, angry, confused, and a whole range of other emotions. There’s no “right” way to grieve, and it’s particularly difficult when it’s compounded by other issues.
* **The Sister Dynamic:** Your sister’s comments about your relationship with your mother are incredibly hurtful, especially when you’re already vulnerable. It’s natural to feel defensive and resentful. The fact that she's bringing this up likely feels like she’s minimizing your grief and perhaps judging your relationship with your mother.  It's valid to feel like she's not offering support, but rather, criticism.
* **Hopelessness:** This feeling of hopelessness often stems from a sense of isolation and feeling like things won't get better. It’s often a symptom of profound sadness and loss.

**What You Can Do (Things to Consider):**

1. **Prioritize Self-Care:** This is *crucial*. When you're feeling this way, it's easy to neglect yourself. Focus on small, manageable things that bring you a little comfort. This could include:
   * **Basic Needs:** Make sure you're eating regularly, getting enough sleep (even if it's difficult), and staying hydrated.
   * **Gentle Activities:**  Things like taking a warm bath, listening to music, spending time in nature (if you can), or reading a book can offer a small respite.
   * **Mindfulness:** Even a few minutes of deep breathing or meditation can help ground you.

2. **Boundaries with Your Sister:** This is really important. You have the right to protect yourself from hurtful comments. Here are a few ways you could respond, depending on the situation:
   * **Direct Communication (if you feel up to it):** ""I appreciate you sharing your perspective, but right now, I'm dealing with a very sensitive time.  I don’t need comments about my relationship with Mom.”
   * **Grey Rocking:**  This involves becoming as uninteresting as possible to the person.  Give short, neutral answers and avoid engaging in emotional discussions.
   * **Limit Contact:** If her comments are consistently hurtful, it's okay to reduce the amount of time you spend with her.

3. **Seek Support:** You don't have to go through this alone.
   * **Therapy:** Talking to a therapist can provide a safe space to process your grief, address your relationship issues, and develop coping strategies.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or grief counseling could be particularly helpful.
   * **Support Groups:** Connecting with others who have experienced similar losses can be incredibly validating and supportive.
   * **Trusted Friends/Family:** If you have someone you trust, lean on them for support.

4. **Process Your Grief:**
    * **Allow Yourself to Feel:** Don't try to suppress your emotions. Let yourself cry, be angry, or whatever you need to feel.
    * **Remember Your Mom:** Focus on the positive memories you have of your mother.  This can be a way to honor her memory and feel connected to her.
    * **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a helpful way to process them.

289,"I was anxious to go to middle school. I was afraid of what people might say about me, so when school started, I wasn't acting like myself. I was quiet, which I'm usually not. I didn't talk to anybody and didn't have any friends. Then a few years later, my grandma died. I really became depressed and stop going to school for a little. I hated myself and still do. I just need help. I need someone to care for me. I need someone to show that they care.","I agree; you need more care and support. No one deserves to feel alone, or like they hate themselves. We're all wonderful, imperfect, complicated people and we're at our best when we're all helping each other. I'm glad you wrote this question, because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes. I can tell that you're smart, because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connected...you ""not being yourself"", and then how you felt when your grandma died. When Grandma died, you needed and deserved extra love and support, but the people around you didn't seem to give it to you, maybe. My hunch is that they wanted to, but that they didn't know how much you needed it, or what you needed exactly. The older you get, the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need. Maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature, but that's how it works. When you started middle school, it sounds like you changed; you got more quiet, right? That must have felt weird, to not be acting like yourself. It sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldn't like you. Fear can be silly. So then, fear got you to not show yourself, and when we don't show ourselves, people can't see who we are; they don't know us as well and then they don't know what we need and they can't care for us as well either. Fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you. It does that to a lot of us. So, where you're at right now is because of what fear did to you, and also because when Grandma died you were already isolated so people couldn't see your pain and know that you needed support. There's a simple solution, but you'd have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say ""Get off my back!"". ""You're not helping me by telling me lies."" Can you be brave enough to go back to your old, louder, self? If you talk to the people closest to you...tell them what you think and how you feel, then they'll be able to give you the care that you want and deserve. I wish you well as you try this!","Okay, thank you so much for sharing this with me. It takes incredible courage to talk about something so deeply painful and vulnerable. What you're describing sounds incredibly difficult, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling this way. It’s clear you've been carrying a heavy burden of shame, anxiety, and grief, and it’s brave of you to reach out for help.

Let me be very clear: **you are not alone, and you don't deserve to feel this way.** What you experienced in middle school – the fear, the withdrawal, and the subsequent grief – was a reaction to a lot of pressure and a significant loss. It’s not a reflection of your worth, and the feelings you have about yourself are understandable given what you've been through.

It sounds like you're craving connection and someone to show you that you’re cared for, and that’s a really important and natural need. Let's address this in a way that acknowledges the depth of what you're feeling.

**Here's what I want you to know and what we can do:**

1. **Validating Your Feelings:**  The feelings you describe – shame, self-hatred, depression – are *real* and deserve to be acknowledged. Don't try to push them away or tell yourself you shouldn't feel this way. It's okay to feel these things, especially after experiencing such a challenging time.  The fact that you're still struggling with this years later shows how deeply this has impacted you.

2. **You Don't Have to Carry This Alone:** You've recognized you need someone to care for you, and that's a huge first step. I can’t *be* that person in the way you’re hoping for, but I can offer a safe space to talk, listen without judgment, and help you explore some options.  I want to be a supportive presence while you work towards finding the support you truly need.

3. **Let’s Talk About Steps You Can Take:**

   * **Professional Help is Crucial:**  I strongly encourage you to speak with a therapist or counselor. They are trained to help you process difficult emotions, challenge negative self-talk, and develop coping strategies.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) are often helpful for dealing with anxiety, shame, and depression.  You can find therapists through:
      * **Your Family Doctor:** They can often provide referrals.
      * **Psychology Today Website:** [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) – You can filter by location and insurance.
      * **Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs):** If you're employed, check if your company offers an EAP.

   * **Start Small:**  It's okay if you’re feeling overwhelmed.  Let's focus on small, manageable steps.  Maybe it's just reaching out to one of the resources listed above.  Or perhaps it's just acknowledging to yourself, “I’m struggling, and that’s okay.”

   * **Self-Compassion:**  This is incredibly important.  Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend going through a similar situation.  Challenge those negative thoughts you have about yourself.  Ask yourself, “Would I say this to a friend?”

4. **I'm Here to Listen:**  I want to continue to be a space for you to express yourself.  I can ask you more questions, help you brainstorm, and simply be a sounding board.  I can't fix your pain, but I can offer support and encouragement.

1832,"Every time I send a message to someone or a group message on Instagram, iMessage, or snapchat people will read my messages but then they won't answer me.    Could it be that there is something they don't like about me? I don't understand why they won't answer my messages. How do I get people to respond to me?","I understand the feeling of not being liked due to not having any responses on the sites you list.More than likely the non-response has less to do with liking you than w liking the way you write your messages.Have you tried asking a question in your posts?  This would be one way to invite people to answer your post.When you write,  imagine yourself as the reader of the post.If you think about the wording of a question which would motivate you to respond, then this formula will very likely be the same for many others who read your post.Good luck!","Okay, this is a really frustrating situation, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling confused and hurt. It's great that you're trying to figure out what's going on and how to address it. Let's break down the potential reasons why people might be reading your messages but not responding, and then talk about what you can do.

**1. It’s Likely Not Personal (Probably)**

The first and most important thing to understand is that *most of the time, it's not about you personally*. People have all sorts of reasons for not responding to messages, and many of them have absolutely nothing to do with your value as a person. Here's a breakdown of common reasons:

* **Busy Schedules:** People are incredibly busy. They might be at work, school, driving, or just overwhelmed with their lives.  A quick read doesn’t equal a quick response.
* **Not Seeing the Message Immediately:** Notifications can be delayed, especially if someone has do-not-disturb enabled, is in a noisy environment, or has a phone that’s not delivering notifications reliably.
* **Not Wanting to Engage in a Conversation:** Sometimes, people just don't *feel* like having a conversation at that moment. It doesn’t mean they don’t like you, just that they’re not in the mood.
* **Different Communication Styles:** Some people are just naturally slower to respond than others.  Don’t assume they're ignoring you if they don't reply instantly.
* **They're Dealing with Something Personal:** They might be going through a tough time – family issues, stress, sadness, etc. – and aren't up to socializing or responding to messages.
* **They're Not Checking Messages Regularly:** Some people genuinely don't check their messaging apps as often as others.

**2. What You Can Do – Strategies for Getting Responses**

Now, let’s focus on what you can *do* to improve your chances of getting responses, while also respecting people's boundaries:

* **Start with a Casual, Low-Pressure Message:** Instead of a long, detailed message, try something simple and friendly like:
    * ""Hey! Just checking in.""
    * ""Hope you're having a good day!""
    * “Thinking of you!”
* **Ask a Specific Question:** This is *much* more likely to get a response than a general greeting.  For example:
    * ""Did you see that [movie/show/article]?""
    * ""What are you up to this weekend?""
* **Reference a Shared Memory or Interest:**  ""Remember that time we [did something]?  That was hilarious!""
* **Don't Over-Message:** Sending multiple messages in a short period can feel overwhelming and might actually push people away.  Give them space.
* **Respect Their Silence:** If they don’t respond after a reasonable amount of time (24-48 hours is a good starting point, depending on your relationship), *stop* sending messages.  Continuing to send messages when they haven’t responded can come across as needy or pushy.
* **Reach Out Through Other Channels (Sometimes):** If you’re not getting a response on messaging, consider reaching out via phone call (if you have their number) or, if appropriate, through a mutual friend.  *Don’t* bombard them with messages across multiple platforms.

**3. Addressing Your Feelings & Potential Concerns**

It’s completely normal to feel hurt or insecure when people don’t respond to your messages. Here’s how to deal with those feelings:

* **Recognize Your Own Needs:** Are you craving connection and validation? Understanding *why* you're feeling this way can help you address it.
* **Don't Jump to Conclusions:** Resist the urge to assume the worst.  As mentioned earlier, it’s often not about you.
* **Focus on Building Other Relationships:** Don’t put all your social energy into people who aren’t reciprocating. Invest in relationships where you feel valued and supported.
* **Self-Care:** Engage in activities you enjoy, spend time with people who make you feel good, and prioritize your own well-being.

**4. Important Note About Boundaries**

It's also important to recognize that *everyone* has the right to set boundaries around their communication. If someone consistently ignores your messages, it's okay to accept that they may not be interested in a regular connection.

**To help me give you more tailored advice, could you tell me a little more about these situations?**

*   **Who are you talking to?** (e.g., close friends, acquaintances, family members?)
*   **What kind of messages are you sending?** (e.g., long, detailed conversations, quick check-ins, questions?)

3505,"I think adult life is making him depressed and we often sleep in on weekends untill 1 or 2 pm. We just eat, smoke weed, watch movies, and he'll go on his phone all day. He doesn't seem motivated to do much and he's often angry.

How do I help him?",How do you help yourself to believe you require more than what he offers to you?What do you get from this relationship which feels satisfying?To answer this question may in the longterm be the best way to help your bf.,"Okay, this is a really common and difficult situation. It sounds like you're seeing a pattern of behavior that’s clearly impacting your friend, and you're feeling helpless and frustrated. It's great that you recognize the issue and want to help – that's a really important first step. Let's break down how you can approach this, understanding that there's no magic bullet, and progress might be slow.

**1. Understanding the Root of the Problem:**

* **Adulting is Hard:** You’re right, the transition to adult life can be incredibly overwhelming. Responsibilities, financial pressures, career anxieties, and the lack of a clear structure can contribute significantly to depression and feelings of hopelessness.
* **Sleep Patterns:** Sleeping in on weekends is often a symptom of depression – a lack of motivation and energy. It can perpetuate the cycle, as it reduces the opportunity for structure and activity.
* **Substance Use (Weed):** While weed can sometimes provide temporary relief from anxiety or depression, it can also worsen symptoms in the long run, especially if it's used as a coping mechanism. It can numb feelings, but doesn't address the underlying issues.
* **Anger:** Anger is often a secondary emotion – it can stem from feelings of frustration, helplessness, or sadness.

**2. How You Can Help (Focus on Support & Gentle Encouragement):**

* **Listen Without Judgment:** This is *crucial*. He needs someone to hear him out without offering unsolicited advice or criticizing his choices. Just be there to listen when he wants to talk.  Start with phrases like, “It sounds like you’re really struggling,” or “I’m here if you want to talk about what’s going on.”
* **Validate His Feelings:** Don’t minimize his experience. Saying things like ""That sounds really tough"" or ""I can understand why you'd feel that way"" can make a huge difference.
* **Small, Gentle Encouragement:** Instead of telling him to “get motivated,” suggest small, achievable activities. ""Want to go for a short walk with me?"" or “There’s a new movie playing, maybe we could check it out.”  Don’t pressure him; just offer.
* **Suggest Structure (Subtly):**  Help him create a *small* amount of structure. Maybe suggest a simple weekly schedule, even if it’s just waking up at a consistent time on weekends.
* **Focus on Shared Activities:**  Continue doing things you used to enjoy together. This can help reconnect him with positive experiences and remind him of happier times.
* **Be Patient:** Recovery from depression takes time. There will be good days and bad days. Don’t get discouraged if he doesn’t immediately respond positively to your efforts.

**3. Addressing the Substance Use (Delicately):**

* **Avoid Confrontation:** Directly criticizing his weed use is likely to backfire.
* **Express Concern:** You can say something like, ""I've noticed you've been relying on weed a lot lately, and I'm worried about you. I care about your well-being.""
* **Suggest Seeking Help:** If you’re seriously concerned, gently suggest talking to a professional. ""Have you ever thought about talking to someone about how you’re feeling? There are resources that can help.""

**4. Encouraging Professional Help:**

* **This is Key:**  You can't fix this on your own. Depression is a serious medical condition. Suggesting professional help is the most important thing you can do.

**5. Taking Care of Yourself:**

* **Set Boundaries:** It's okay to protect your own mental and emotional well-being. You can’t pour from an empty cup.
* **Don’t Take it Personally:** His anger or withdrawal isn’t necessarily about you.
* **Seek Support for Yourself:** Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist about how you're feeling.

You've listed a significant and complex set of challenges, and it’s incredibly brave of you to acknowledge them and reach out for support. The short answer is: **no, you don’t have “too many” issues to address in counseling.** In fact, the breadth of what you're describing suggests a *need* for comprehensive support.

Let's break down why this is a lot, and then talk about how to approach it:

**Why It Feels Like Too Much:**

* **Trauma History (Sexual Abuse):**  Sexual abuse is deeply ingrained trauma. It can profoundly impact self-esteem, relationships, anxiety, depression, and sleep. The effects can be long-lasting and complex.
* **Cancer Survivor:**  Being a breast cancer survivor adds another layer of stress, fear, and potentially body image issues. The physical and emotional impact of treatment can linger.
* **Chronic Insomnia:**  Insomnia isn’t just a nuisance; it's a significant health concern that can exacerbate other issues like depression and anxiety.
* **Long-Standing Depression:** Depression can be a constant companion, impacting your mood, motivation, and overall well-being.
* **Emerging Anxiety:**  Anxiety is often a response to underlying stress and trauma, and it’s perfectly normal to be experiencing it now.
* **Low Self-Esteem:** This is often a consequence of trauma and can fuel negative self-talk and feelings of inadequacy.
* **Long-Term Relationship:** While a happy 35-year marriage is wonderful, it also means there are established patterns and dynamics that may need to be examined, especially when dealing with underlying emotional issues.


**Here’s What To Do - How to Approach Counseling:**

1. **Start with the Right Therapist:** This is *crucial*. You need a therapist who specializes in trauma, chronic illness, and/or anxiety. Look for:
   * **Trauma-Informed Therapist:** Someone trained in approaches like EMDR, CBT-Trauma Focused, or Somatic Experiencing.
   * **Experience with Chronic Illness:**  A therapist who understands the unique challenges of living with a chronic condition like cancer and insomnia.
   * **Warmth and Non-Judgment:**  You need someone you feel safe and comfortable opening up to.

2. **Prioritize – But Don’t Limit Yourself:** It’s okay to start with one area and gradually expand. However, don’t feel like you have to “fix” everything at once. Here’s a possible approach:
   * **Phase 1: Stabilization & Trauma Processing (if appropriate):**  Initially, focus on building coping skills, managing anxiety, and potentially beginning to process the trauma of the sexual abuse. This might involve grounding techniques, relaxation exercises, and perhaps starting with the most distressing aspects of your abuse.
   * **Phase 2: Chronic Illness & Insomnia:**  Address the impact of cancer and insomnia on your mental and emotional health.  This could involve strategies for managing fatigue, coping with fear, and improving sleep hygiene.
   * **Phase 3:  Self-Esteem & Relationship Dynamics:**  As you gain stability, you can then address your low self-esteem and explore any patterns in your marriage that might be contributing to your difficulties.

3. **Be Honest and Open:**  Your therapist can only help you if you’re honest about your experiences, thoughts, and feelings.

4. **It's Okay to Take It Slow:** You don't have to dive into the deepest parts of your trauma immediately.  Start with what feels manageable.

5. **Self-Care is Essential:**  Alongside therapy, prioritize self-care – activities that bring you joy, relaxation, and a sense of well-being.

179,"I'm in my late teens and live with my dad. The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I won't want to talk to them for days or even weeks.    Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.
   Are they right, am I depressed?","I'm alway wary of assigning a term to a feeling, as often that term becomes more important than the feeling itself. From the very little that you have written, it is clear that you are going through something that has made you extremely low, affected your self-esteem and motivation, limits your enjoyment of formerly pleasurable activities and affects your feelings of self-worth. All of these are aspects of being depressed, though you can be depressed and still not have ""depression"". Counseling is definitely a place where you can go and sort out why you have had such a sudden a drastic change to your mood. Sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine, losses or significant disappointments. Talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way, but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the future. I do hope that you will reach out. Feeling alone can be harmful over long periods of time, as it can stop us from seeking out the support we need.","Okay, let's tackle this. What you're describing – the fluctuating desire to connect with friends, the feelings of inadequacy, and the voice telling you you're not worth knowing – is actually a really common experience, especially for young adults navigating college and figuring out who they are. It’s fantastic that you're recognizing these feelings and asking for help. Let's break down what's going on and address your question about whether you might be depressed.

**1. Understanding Your Behavior:**

* **Fluctuating Connection:** It's completely normal to have periods where you want to engage with friends and periods where you want to withdraw. Teenage and young adult brains are still developing, and social interaction can be exhausting. Some days you’ll feel energized and social, others you’ll need to recharge and be alone. The fact that you *want* to connect sometimes, but then pull back, suggests this isn't necessarily a deep, underlying issue.
* **Feeling of Inadequacy:** The voice telling you you're not worth knowing or that you'll never do anything right is a *critical inner critic*. These voices are often fueled by self-doubt, past experiences, or societal pressures. They can be incredibly damaging, but they don't necessarily reflect reality.
* **College Stress:** College is a huge transition – new environment, new people, academic pressure, and often a shift in living arrangements. This can be incredibly overwhelming and lead to feeling isolated, even when you're surrounded by people.

**2. Are You Depressed?**

It's impossible for me to diagnose you with depression. However, your symptoms *do* align with some of the common signs of depression, particularly when combined. Here's what to look for:

* **Persistent Sadness or Low Mood:** You mention feeling you're not worth knowing – this can be a sign of low self-worth, which is often linked to depression.
* **Loss of Interest:** While you don't explicitly say you’ve lost interest in things, the withdrawal from friends could be a symptom of a deeper feeling of disconnection.
* **Changes in Sleep or Appetite:** Are you sleeping more or less than usual? Are you eating more or less?
* **Low Energy:** Do you feel constantly tired, even after getting enough sleep?
* **Difficulty Concentrating:** Are you struggling to focus on your studies or other tasks?

**Important Note:**  Depression isn’t just feeling sad. It's a persistent and pervasive feeling of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in things you used to enjoy. It can significantly impact your daily life.

**3. What You Can Do:**

* **Talk to Someone:** This is the *most* important step.  You've already taken a huge one by asking this question. Here are some options:
    * **Your Dad:** Even though you feel distant, he’s your family.  Start by just talking to him about how you're feeling, even if it’s just to say you're stressed about college.
    * **A Counselor or Therapist:**  College counseling centers are often a great resource – they’re confidential and trained to help you work through these kinds of feelings.
    * **A Trusted Teacher or Professor:** They often have experience with students struggling with similar issues.
    * **A School Psychologist:** They can offer support and guidance.
* **Challenge Your Negative Thoughts:** When you hear that critical voice, actively challenge it. Ask yourself: “Is this thought actually true? What evidence do I have to support it? What would I say to a friend who was having this thought?”
* **Small Steps:** Don't try to overhaul your entire social life overnight. Start with small, manageable steps, like saying hello to someone in class or inviting a friend for coffee.
* **Self-Care:** Make sure you're taking care of yourself – eating healthy, getting enough sleep, and finding activities you enjoy.
* **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a helpful way to process them.

**In conclusion,** what you’re experiencing is complex and valid. You're not alone, and it's brave of you to acknowledge these feelings. It's likely a combination of normal stress, self-doubt, and potentially early signs of something deeper.  Please, take that first step and talk to someone.

1921,"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?","This is a great question. Finding the right therapist can be tricky because you don't really know how someone will be like until you meet them. A few ways to prescreen are to:- Visit the therapist's website, psychologytoday profile, social media, etc...- Have a phone call with the therapist prior to your first appointmentOnce you meet your therapist it is important to be clear with your wishes and expectations. We are trained in helping you thrive in your life but we cannot mind read so if you don't tell us, we won't know. Don't be shy about what you like and what you don't like. A good therapist will listen to your needs, process them with you, and create a customized plan that works for you and your life. A good therapist will also not take anything you say (even criticism) personally. Coming to therapy is hard and often times you might not want to go. What makes a good therapist is someone who understands this and tries to make you feel as comfortable as possible while you address uncomfortable topics.","Okay, this is a really important and often tricky question! Finding the right therapist is a huge part of successful therapy, and understanding how to work with them is key. Let's break down how to know you have the right therapist and how to ""train"" them to meet your needs.

**1. How to Know You Have the Right Therapist:**

It's not always a lightning bolt moment, but here's what to look for:

* **Initial Connection – Rapport is Key:** This is arguably the MOST important factor. Do you feel *seen* and *heard* in the first session? Do you feel like they genuinely care about understanding you? It's okay if you don't click immediately, but there should be a foundation of respect and a willingness to explore.
* **Good Fit – Personality & Style:** Therapists have different styles. Some are more directive (they’ll guide the conversation), while others are more reflective (they’ll ask you to explore your thoughts and feelings). Some are more warm and empathetic, while others are more clinical.  Think about what kind of communication style resonates with you.
* **Understanding of Your Issues:** Do they seem to grasp the core of what you're struggling with?  Do they ask clarifying questions? Do they offer potential explanations or approaches that feel relevant?
* **You Feel Safe and Comfortable:** This is crucial. You need to feel safe enough to be vulnerable and explore difficult emotions. If you consistently feel judged, dismissed, or uncomfortable, it’s time to consider a different therapist.
* **Realistic Expectations:** A good therapist will explain the process of therapy and what to expect. They’ll be honest about the time it takes and the potential challenges.
* **They Validate Your Experience:**  They should acknowledge and validate your feelings, even if they don’t fully understand them. ""That sounds incredibly difficult"" or ""It makes sense that you would feel that way"" can be powerful.
* **You're Learning & Growing:** Therapy should be a process of learning and growth. Are you starting to see things differently? Are you developing coping mechanisms? Are you making progress, even if it’s slow?

**2. How to ""Train"" Your Therapist:**

Think of it less as ""training"" and more as a collaborative partnership. Here's how you can guide your therapist towards meeting your needs:

* **Be Clear About Your Goals:**  At the beginning, and periodically, explicitly state what you want to get out of therapy. “I want to learn to manage my anxiety,” or “I want to understand the roots of my relationship patterns,” or “I want to develop healthier communication skills.”
* **Provide Feedback (Gently):** This is *essential*. Don't be afraid to say, “I’m not quite sure I understand what you’re suggesting here,” or ""Could you explain that in a different way?"" or “I feel like we’ve been focusing on X, but I’m really struggling with Y.”  Frame it constructively – focus on *your* experience.
* **Direct Them to Relevant Techniques:** If you've heard about a specific technique that might be helpful (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, mindfulness exercises, journaling prompts), you can say, “I’ve been reading about [technique] and I was wondering if we could try that.”
* **Ask for Clarification on Their Approach:** “What is your general approach to treating [your issue]?”  “How do you typically work with clients who are struggling with [specific symptom]?”
* **Set the Agenda (Within Reason):** You can suggest topics you'd like to discuss during the session, *especially* if they seem to be drifting off-topic or avoiding the core issues. “I’d really like to talk about [specific event] today.”
* **Give Specific Examples:** Instead of saying ""I feel overwhelmed,"" you could say, ""When I was talking about my job, I felt overwhelmed. Could we explore what specifically triggered that feeling?""
* **Check-in Regularly:**  ""Is this approach feeling helpful for you?  Are there things we could be doing differently?""
* **Be Patient (But Persistent):** Finding the right fit takes time. Don't give up after one session. It's okay to try a few different therapists before you find someone who truly understands you.

**Important Note:** A good therapist *should* be responsive to your feedback and willing to adjust their approach. If a therapist consistently dismisses your concerns, refuses to adapt, or doesn't seem to be listening, it's a sign that they may not be the right fit for you.

346,"Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  Am I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal.","You need to find an outlet. Someone to talk to. Your dad or someone who loves your mother as well is someone ideal. But anyone could help. Just look to someone for help. If you can't find anyone who you think will listen, talk to your mom. It can help greatly just to get the words out. Tell her how you feel about her passing, but then also about everything else. Talk to her about your day. Tell her about happy things. I don't know if you're a religious person, or where you believe she is now, but no matter what you can talk to her.","Okay, let's address this. It’s incredibly brave of you to reach out and talk about this. What you're experiencing is *absolutely* understandable, and you are definitely not crazy. It’s a very common reaction to a belief in an eternal afterlife, especially when that afterlife is presented as potentially daunting like the concepts of hell or endless heaven. Let's break down why this is happening and what you can do.

**Why You're Feeling This Way:**

* **The Immensity of Eternity:** The concept of *forever* is inherently difficult for the human mind to grasp. Our brains are wired to deal with finite timeframes. The sheer scale of eternity can be overwhelming and frightening. It’s like trying to imagine a number so large it’s beyond comprehension.
* **Religious Beliefs and Anxiety:** Your upbringing has instilled a specific belief system, and that belief is triggering anxiety. When a belief system introduces the possibility of a potentially negative or overwhelming outcome (like eternal punishment or an unending state of being), it's natural for anxiety to arise.
* **Fear of the Unknown:** A huge part of the anxiety stems from the *unknown*. What would an eternal existence actually *be* like? What would you *do* for eternity? The lack of concrete answers can be incredibly unsettling.
* **Cognitive Dissonance:** You're holding two conflicting ideas: a comforting religious belief and a deeply unsettling feeling. This creates mental tension, which can manifest as anxiety.
* **Panic Attacks:** It’s important to note that your anxiety is leading to panic attacks. This is a serious symptom and needs to be taken seriously.

**Are These Thoughts Normal?**

Yes, they are. It's far more common than you might think. Many people grapple with these anxieties when confronted with the idea of an eternal afterlife. The fact that you're struggling with it indicates a thoughtful and sensitive mind – not a “crazy” one.

**What You Can Do:**

1. **Acknowledge and Validate Your Feelings:** The first step is to simply acknowledge that you're having these thoughts and that they're okay. Don't beat yourself up for feeling anxious or overwhelmed.  Tell yourself, ""It's okay to feel this way. It's a normal reaction to a complex belief.""

2. **Challenge the Thoughts:** When you have a particularly distressing thought, try to gently challenge it. Ask yourself:
   * ""Is this thought based on fear, or on actual evidence?""
   * ""What's the worst that could *really* happen?"" (Often, the worst-case scenario is less terrifying than the imagined one.)
   * ""Is this thought serving me, or is it causing me distress?""

3. **Focus on the Present Moment:** Anxiety often thrives on worrying about the future. Ground yourself in the present. Try mindfulness exercises, meditation, or simply focusing on your senses – what you see, hear, feel, smell, and taste.

4. **Talk to Someone You Trust:** Sharing your feelings with a trusted friend, family member, or religious leader can provide support and perspective.

5. **Seek Professional Help:** This is *crucially* important, especially given the panic attacks. A therapist can help you:
   * Process your anxiety.
   * Develop coping mechanisms.
   * Explore the underlying reasons for your anxieties.
   *  Sometimes, a therapist can help you reframe your beliefs in a way that’s less anxiety-provoking. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is often very effective for anxiety.

6. **Explore Your Beliefs More Deeply (with caution):**  Instead of simply accepting the belief without question, you could explore the *reasoning* behind it.  Is there evidence that supports it?  Are there alternative interpretations? This can sometimes lead to a more comfortable understanding.

7. **Limit Exposure to Anxiety-Inducing Content:** If certain religious teachings or discussions are consistently triggering your anxiety, try to limit your exposure to them.

1953,"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","Yes, it is very normal to cry during a therapy appointment.  When you meet with a counselor, you are opening yourself up and sharing very vulnerable sides of yourself.  Through this deep introspection, emotions (sometimes unexpected) can come out and this is completely okay and very healthy.  Research has shown that crying reduces pain by releasing oxytocin and endorphins and reduces stress through the release of stress reduction hormones.","It's absolutely **normal** for people to cry during therapy! In fact, it's a really common and often incredibly valuable part of the process. You're definitely not just you. 

Here's a breakdown of why it happens and why it's so frequently observed:

**1. Why People Cry in Therapy:**

* **Emotional Release:** Therapy creates a safe and supportive space where you feel comfortable exploring difficult emotions.  Crying is often a natural and powerful way to release pent-up feelings like sadness, grief, anger, shame, fear, or overwhelm.
* **Vulnerability & Trust:**  Allowing yourself to be vulnerable – showing your emotions – builds trust with your therapist. It signals that you're willing to engage deeply with your issues.
* **Processing Trauma:**  Trauma often gets ""stuck"" in the body and can manifest as intense emotions. Crying can be a key part of processing and releasing the impact of traumatic experiences.
* **Feeling Heard & Understood:**  When you're crying and your therapist is offering empathy and validation, it can feel incredibly powerful and reassuring.  It confirms that you’re being truly heard and understood.
* **Breaking Down Defenses:** Sometimes, crying helps to break down emotional defenses you might have unconsciously built up to protect yourself.
* **It's a Physical Response:**  Emotions have a physical component. Crying is a physiological response to strong feelings.

**2. It’s More Common Than You Think:**

* **Research:** Studies have shown that a significant percentage of people cry during therapy sessions. Estimates vary, but many therapists report that it happens fairly frequently.
* **Not a Sign of Weakness:**  It’s crucial to understand that crying in therapy isn't a sign of weakness. It's a sign of courage, openness, and a willingness to confront your emotions.

**3. What Your Therapist Will Do:**

* **Validate Your Feelings:** Your therapist will likely respond with empathy, acknowledging your emotions and validating your experience.
* **Offer Support:** They'll offer reassurance and support to help you feel safe and grounded.
* **Explore the Root of the Emotion:** They’ll likely gently guide you to explore *why* you’re feeling this way.
* **Grounding Techniques:** If you’re overwhelmed, they might use grounding techniques to help you regain control.

**4. It's Okay If You Don't Cry:**

Of course, not everyone cries in therapy. Some people are naturally more stoic, or they may be experiencing emotions differently. That's perfectly okay too!  The important thing is that you’re comfortable and that your therapist is responding appropriately to your needs.

**If you're concerned about crying in therapy, or if you’re struggling to express your emotions, talk to your therapist.** They can help you explore your feelings and find ways to communicate them effectively.

2661,"My friend is abusing her prescription medicine. Even though she told me she didn't have any more pills, I found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications.","Your good intentions to help your friend stay clean, are very caring about her.Unless your friend feels like stopping pills,  taking them away will mean she finds them some place else.The problem that anyone who is addicted to pills has, is that the person is psychologically and at least with xanax, physically addicted.Taking pills has basically become a standard part of your friend's life.Her problem is bigger than your ability to care.If you haven't already done so, tell your friend directly about your opinion on the way she is using pills.This is not a guarantee that she'll stop.It isa way of you showing that you care about her.Offering love and advice are the only things you can do for her.Meanwhile, knowing she is hurting herself is probably hurting you.Be sure to keep a sense of balance within yourself.  Offer your concern and know she is the one who must decide to stop using.","This is a really difficult and concerning situation, and it's great that you're recognizing it and wanting to help your friend. Discovering that she's been misusing her medication, especially after she’s confided in you, adds a significant layer of complexity. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, focusing on your friend’s well-being and your own boundaries:

**1. Prioritize Your Friend’s Safety and Well-being:**

* **Express Your Concern Directly & Gently:**  Start by reaffirming your care for her. Something like, ""I'm really worried about you. I care about you a lot, and I've noticed some things that have me concerned about your medication use.”  Avoid accusations. Focus on your observations and feelings.
* **Validate Her Feelings:**  Add, “I know you've been struggling with anxiety, and I understand you’re trying to find relief.  It takes courage to seek help, and I want to support you.""
* **Don't Judge:**  Misuse of medication is often rooted in underlying issues like untreated mental health conditions, trauma, or addiction.  Judgment will shut down communication.

**2. Understand What’s Happening:**

* **Ask Open-Ended Questions (Carefully):** Instead of confronting her about the pills, try to understand *why* she’s taking them in a way that doesn't feel accusatory.  Examples:
    * ""Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling lately?""
    * ""What’s been making things difficult for you?""
    * ""How are you managing your anxiety?""
    * ""Are you finding your medication helpful, or are there things you'd like to change about how you're taking it?""
* **Listen Empathetically:** Really listen to her answers.  Try to understand her perspective, even if you don't agree with her actions. Reflect back what you hear to ensure you understand correctly (""So, it sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and..."").

**3. Recognizing Potential Underlying Issues:**

* **Anxiety and Medication Misuse:**  There’s a strong link between anxiety and substance misuse.  She might be using the medication to self-medicate, and it’s become a coping mechanism.
* **Underlying Mental Health Condition:**  Explore if she’s been diagnosed with depression, trauma, or another condition that could be contributing.
* **Co-occurring Disorders:** It’s possible she has a co-occurring substance use disorder alongside her anxiety.

**4. Encourage Professional Help – This is Crucial:**

* **Suggest Talking to Her Doctor:**  ""I really think it would be helpful to talk to your doctor about how you're feeling and how you're managing your anxiety. They can help you find the best approach.""
* **Offer to Help Her Make an Appointment:**  Sometimes, the biggest hurdle is just scheduling the appointment. “Would you like me to help you find a therapist or schedule an appointment with your doctor?""
* **Provide Resources:**  Here are some resources you can share:

**5. Setting Boundaries – Protecting Yourself:**

* **You Are Not Her Therapist:** It’s important to remember you are a friend, not a mental health professional. You can offer support, but you can’t fix her problems.
* **Limit Involvement:**  You don't have to enable her behavior.  If she asks you for pills, firmly but kindly decline. “I can’t help you with that. It’s not safe, and it’s not something I’m comfortable with.”
* **Protect Your Own Well-being:**  Supporting someone struggling with addiction or misuse can be emotionally draining. Make sure you’re taking care of yourself.

It is your choice to participate in an abusive relationship. You can not stop an abusive partner from being abusive no matter how wonderfully you treat your partner.

It's a form of control and punishment, and it's incredibly damaging to a relationship. Let's break down what's happening and what you can do about it.

**Understanding What's Happening:**

* **Silent Treatment as Control:** The silent treatment isn't about you; it's about *him* needing to feel in control of the situation. It’s a way to punish you, make you feel guilty, and force you to respond on *his* terms. It’s a power dynamic where he dictates your emotional state.
* **Lack of Communication Skills:** He's clearly struggling with healthy communication. He can't express his feelings directly, doesn’t take responsibility for his actions, and avoids conflict resolution.
* **Defensiveness & Lack of Empathy:** His sarcasm and refusal to apologize indicate a significant lack of empathy and a tendency to be defensive. He’s likely prioritizing his own feelings and needs above yours.
* **It's Not About You:** Repeatedly, it's crucial to understand that his behavior isn’t a reflection of your actions or worth. It’s a reflection of *his* internal struggles and inability to handle emotions constructively.


**What You Can Do (and What You Shouldn't Do):**

1. **Recognize and Validate Your Feelings:** This is *so* important.  You're completely justified in feeling hurt, frustrated, confused, and even angry. Don’t minimize your feelings or tell yourself you’re overreacting.  Your feelings are valid.

2. **Set Firm Boundaries (and Stick to Them):** This is the most crucial step. You need to establish boundaries around his behavior. Here are some ways to do that:

   * **State Your Response:** The *very next time* he gives you the silent treatment, say something like: “I’m noticing you’re giving me the silent treatment. That’s not a healthy way to communicate, and it’s hurting me. I need you to talk to me directly about what's bothering you.”
   * **Don’t Engage:** *Do not* respond to his sarcasm or attempt to reason with him when he's giving you the silent treatment.  If he continues to be silent, simply state, ""I'm ending this conversation until you're willing to communicate respectfully.""  Then, walk away.
   * **Limit Your Availability:** If he consistently uses the silent treatment, you can limit your availability to him. Don't check your phone constantly waiting for a response.

3. **Communicate Your Needs (When He’s Willing):**  You can express *how* his behavior affects you, but only when he’s willing to engage in a calm conversation.  For example: ""When you shut me out and don't talk to me, I feel ignored, unimportant, and like you don't respect my feelings. I need to feel like I can talk to you about anything.""

4. **Don’t Try to ‘Fix’ Him:** You can't change his behavior. He has to be willing to take responsibility for his actions and learn healthier communication skills.

5. **Consider Your Own Well-being:** This situation is draining. Prioritize your mental and emotional health.  Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist.

**What *Not* To Do:**

* **Begging or Pleading:** This will only reinforce his behavior.
* **Guilt-Tripping:** Don't try to make him feel bad for giving you the silent treatment.
* **Engaging in Arguments When He’s Silent:** This will escalate the situation.
* **Letting it Continue Unchecked:**  If this pattern continues, it's a serious red flag.


**Important Note:**  The silent treatment can be a form of emotional abuse. If his behavior escalates, becomes increasingly controlling, or involves other forms of manipulation or disrespect, it's important to seek support and consider ending the relationship.

869,"My ex-fiancé (whom I am still seeing) left me because of the pressure from all three of his teenage daughters. They wanted him to try to work it out with their mom (his ex-girlfriend of 20 years). He and I split three months ago, but I have been seeing him pretty regularly despite the fact that he is living back with his ex-girlfriend and kids. He is ""co-existing"" for the kids and fighting all the time with his ex-girlfriend. His daughters don’t want their dad with me because my two boys (grown adults and on their own now) had bad reputations and issues with drugs. His daughters say it is embarrassing for him to be with me. He and I had an absolutely amazing relationship and connect on so many levels. He is getting a lot of pressure from his family and his longtime friends to ""do the right thing"" and stay with his ex-girlfriend for the kids. He says he wants me to wait. We were going get married last year. He bought me a $1000 dress, we had invitations made, and everything set up, but then his girls told him they'd never speak to him again if he married me. He says he’s trying to mend his relationship with them.","Hello. It seems you are in a set of circumstances that are highly uncomfortable for you. Do you feel those circumstances are healthy? Do you find pleasure being in such a place of uncertainty? Why do you continue to be in this situation? Without meaning to appear that I might be lacking in compassion, you do have the option to leave the connection completely if the harm it is doing is more that the pleasure it brings you. Is there a benefit to being in this relationship? Do you consider this situation to be for your highest good? Is it healthy to be involved in something that is not likely healthy or perhaps could even be seen as dysfunctional? In truth, only you can decide the answers to these very important questions. I would encourage you to think of who benefits by being in this situation, and how you might be able to find happiness in other relationships that are healthier and more positive. In my clinical view based on what I read, this particular relationship does not carry the joy I am sure you want, nor the healthy interactions you would expect in a functional romantic engagement with another person.Beating yourself up about potentially wasting all this time waiting for the other person to come around will not serve a positive purpose. It likely will only lower your self-esteem. There is a time to wait to see how things develop, and a time to move on to other experiences. You are the one to make that choice, but I would encourage you to connect with your inner higher self, for the most clear answer. Chances are, you already know the answer, you just need to embrace it. Getting in touch with a counselor in your area can also help ferret out some of the deeper issues that you might not have felt comfortable expressing here.","Okay, this is a really complex and emotionally charged situation, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling confused, hurt, and likely a bit stuck. Let's break this down and explore what’s happening and what you can realistically do.

**Understanding the Layers of the Problem:**

* **The Daughters’ Influence:** This is the core of the issue. The teenagers’ reaction is incredibly powerful and, frankly, incredibly immature. They're using their leverage – their father’s love for them – to dictate his choices. Their desire to punish him for the potential relationship is causing immense pressure and is completely outside of your control.
* **His Internal Conflict:** He's caught between his love for his daughters, his feelings for you, and the pressure from his family and friends. He's genuinely trying to ""do the right thing"" according to their definition, which isn’t aligned with his own heart.
* **The Lost Momentum:** The fact that you had already invested emotionally and financially (the dress, invitations) adds another layer of pain and makes it harder to let go.
* **""Co-existing"" Isn't Healthy:** The fact that he's constantly fighting with his ex-girlfriend isn’t a good sign. It demonstrates a lack of closure and suggests he's still trying to navigate a complicated, unresolved situation.


**What You Can Do (and What You Can’t):**

1. **Accept You Can’t Control His Decisions:** This is the *most* important thing. You cannot force him to choose you. His decision is ultimately his, and it's being heavily influenced by factors outside your control. Trying to manipulate him or plead with him won’t change the situation and will likely only damage your own emotional well-being.

2. **Set Firm Boundaries:** You need to establish clear boundaries with him. This means limiting contact.  It’s incredibly difficult, especially given your connection, but it's essential for your healing.  Start with reducing the frequency of calls and texts.  You can say something like, ""I value our connection, but I need to prioritize my own healing and moving forward. I'm going to be taking a step back from our communication for a while.""

3. **Focus on Your Healing:** You've been through a significant loss, and it's okay to grieve. Allow yourself to feel the sadness, disappointment, and frustration.  Lean on your friends and family for support. Consider talking to a therapist – they can provide a safe space to process your emotions and develop coping strategies.

4. **Don't Engage in the Drama:**  Resist the urge to get drawn into arguments with his daughters or his ex-girlfriend. They are using you as a pawn, and your involvement will only fuel the conflict.

5. **Reframe Your Expectations:**  It's highly unlikely that things will suddenly change. The daughters' stance is deeply entrenched. It’s important to accept that this relationship, as it currently exists, might not have a happy ending.


**Addressing the ""Wait"" – Be Cautious:**

His saying ""wait"" is a classic tactic to prolong the situation. It’s likely he’s trying to buy time to deal with his family’s pressure and his own conflicting feelings. Don’t get caught up in the timeline he’s suggesting.

**Important Note:**  His daughters' behavior is deeply concerning. It's not a healthy way for teenagers to handle a relationship. While it’s understandable that he’s trying to appease them, it’s also important to recognize that their actions are driven by insecurity and a desire for control.

1915,"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?","Finding the right therapist can be difficult, especially if you've never tried it before. Things to consider are location, availability and what specifically are you looking for. Some practitioners specifically only work with a certain type of issue (i.e eating disorders, adolescents, anger management, life transitions, anxiety...etc) and others can work with a variety of concerns. As far as training your therapist, you can't. You simply let them know what you are looking to work on or what you think may be an issue for you. Depending on the way they practice(their style of working with clients) is how they will then decide to make a treatment plan that works best for you. You can always ask them their specialty practice population, the problems they generally help others with and what type of mental health provider they are (Psychologist, social worker, licensed mental health counselor).","Okay, this is a really important question, and it's fantastic you're thinking about it proactively. Finding the *right* therapist is a huge factor in the success of your therapy journey. Let's break down how to find the right fit and how to work with them to get what you need.

**1. How to Know You Have the Right Therapist:**

It’s not always a lightning bolt moment, but here are key indicators:

* **Initial Connection (The ""Gut Feeling""):** This is often the most important. Do you feel *seen* by them? Do you feel like they genuinely listen and try to understand you?  Do you feel a basic level of trust? This isn't about instant friendship, but about a sense of safety and respect.
* **Empathy and Validation:** They should be able to accurately reflect back what you’re saying, demonstrating they’re trying to understand your perspective. They should validate your feelings, even if they don't necessarily agree with your behaviors.  ""It makes sense that you're feeling angry/sad/frustrated given what you've been through.""
* **Clear Communication:** Can you talk openly and honestly with them? Do they explain their approach, techniques, and the rationale behind their suggestions?  A good therapist will be able to tailor their communication style to your needs.
* **Respect for Boundaries:**  They should respect your boundaries regarding what you’re comfortable discussing and the pace of the therapy.
* **You're Making Progress (Eventually):** This isn’t immediate, but over time, you should notice shifts in your thinking, feelings, or behaviors.  You might feel a bit more equipped to handle difficult situations, or you might have gained some insight into your patterns. *However, don't expect overnight miracles.*
* **You Feel Safe:**  This is paramount. If at any point you feel unsafe, judged, or uncomfortable, it's time to find a different therapist.

**2. How to ""Train"" Your Therapist (Collaborative Treatment):**

Therapy is a *collaborative* process. You're not just a passive recipient of advice; you're an active participant. Here’s how to guide the process:

* **Be Explicit About Your Goals:** Don’t assume your therapist knows what you want. At the first session (and revisit this periodically), clearly articulate:
    * **What you want to achieve in therapy.** (e.g., “I want to reduce my anxiety,” “I want to improve my communication skills,” “I want to understand the root of my depression.”)
    * **What success looks like for you.** (e.g., “I want to be able to go to parties without feeling overwhelmed,” “I want to be able to express my needs assertively.”)
* **Provide Feedback – Regularly:** This is *crucial*. Don't be afraid to say:
    * ""I don’t understand what you mean by that.""
    * ""Can you explain that in a different way?""
    * “I’m finding this technique challenging. Can we try something else?”
    * ""I'm feeling [emotion] when you [action].  Could you try [alternative approach]?""
* **Ask Questions:**  Don’t hesitate to ask about:
    *  The therapist’s experience with your specific issue.
    *  The rationale behind their chosen techniques.
    *  How the techniques might impact you.
* **Suggest Specific Activities (Within Reason):**  Some therapists are open to incorporating specific exercises or activities into the sessions (e.g., journaling prompts, relaxation techniques, breathing exercises).
* **Be Patient (But Assertive):** It takes time to build a strong therapeutic relationship and for techniques to take effect. However, if something isn't working, don’t just silently endure it.
* **Session Summaries:** At the end of each session, you could briefly summarize what you discussed and what you plan to work on before the next session. This helps solidify the focus.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Therapeutic Alliance:** Research “therapeutic alliance” – this is the bond between you and your therapist. It’s a key predictor of successful therapy.
* **Different Therapeutic Modalities:** There are many different types of therapy (CBT, DBT, psychodynamic, etc.).  Talk to your therapist about which approach they believe would be most suitable for you.
* **Don’t Be Afraid to Switch:** If, after a reasonable amount of time (e.g., 3-6 sessions), you don’t feel like you’re making progress or you don’t feel like you’re a good fit, it’s okay to find a different therapist. It’s a sign of self-awareness and a commitment to your well-being.

229,"I have terrible anxiety and depression. I've tried various therapists and pills, but nothing's helped.","Is it possible you simply didn't mix well with the particular therapists with whom you've worked?   If this is possible, interview a therapist before  starting therapy.   Then you will be choosing a therapist who feels compatible with your way of seeing yourself and your life.Also, therapy isn't for everyone.Read about the different healing modalities and see if one of these speaks to your interest in feeling better.What matters most is finding among all the legitimate healing methods, what you believe will be effective.","Okay, it takes incredible strength and courage to admit that you've been struggling for so long and that traditional approaches haven't worked. It’s completely understandable to feel frustrated and disheartened when you've tried so many things and haven't found relief.  Let’s talk about this. It’s really important to acknowledge that this is a common experience – many people find it takes multiple attempts and different approaches to find what works for them. 

First, I want to validate your feelings.  Feeling like you've tried everything and still haven't found help is incredibly demoralizing.  It's okay to feel angry, sad, hopeless, or just plain exhausted.  Don't beat yourself up about it.

Let's explore this a bit.  To help me understand your situation better and offer some potential avenues to consider, could you tell me a little more about what you’ve tried and what you’ve found challenging about it? Specifically, I'd like to understand:

**1. About Your Previous Treatments:**

*   **Therapies:** Can you tell me a little more about the types of therapy you’ve tried? (e.g., CBT, DBT, psychodynamic, humanistic, etc.)  What did you like or dislike about each one?  Was there anything that felt particularly unhelpful or even made things worse?
*   **Medications:** What medications have you been prescribed? What dosages were you on?  Did you experience any noticeable side effects?  Were you consistently taking them as directed?
*   **How long did you try each treatment for before deciding it wasn’t working?** (Sometimes it takes time for a treatment to start working, but there are limits.)

**2. About Your Experience:**

*   **What does your anxiety and depression feel like for you?** (e.g., racing thoughts, overwhelming sadness, feelings of worthlessness, panic attacks, etc.)  Can you describe a typical day or week when you're experiencing these symptoms?
*   **What are the biggest triggers for your anxiety and depression?** (e.g., social situations, work, finances, relationships, specific memories, etc.)
*   **What are your coping mechanisms currently?** (e.g., isolation, substance use, overeating, excessive exercise, etc.) – I’m asking this to understand what you're *doing* to manage things, not to judge.
*   **What are your goals for treatment?** What would ""feeling better"" look like for you?

**3. Exploring Other Possibilities (Because What's Worked So Far Might Not Be Enough):**

*   **Have you considered a different type of therapist?** (e.g., someone specializing in trauma, someone with experience treating anxiety/depression, a therapist who uses a different approach)
*   **Have you explored different medication options?** (It’s important to discuss this thoroughly with a psychiatrist, as medications can have varying effects.)
*   **Are you open to exploring alternative or complementary therapies?** (e.g., mindfulness meditation, yoga, acupuncture, neurofeedback, light therapy – *always* discuss these with your doctor first).
*   **Have you considered a comprehensive assessment for underlying conditions?** (e.g., thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, ADHD, personality disorders – these can sometimes mimic or worsen symptoms of anxiety and depression).

2716,"I feel angry, anxious, and depressed. The PTSD I suffer is from a past relationship.","If the symptoms are to the extent that they are affecting your ability to function, you may want to consider seeking treatment. PTSD, anxiety, and depression all typically respond well to treatment if provided by a trained clinician. Common types of treatment for PTSD that you may want to look into include Cognitive Processing Therapy or EMDR. The nice things about Cognitive Processing Therapy is that it is time limited and only lasts 17 sessions typically. ","Okay, it takes a lot of courage to even acknowledge these feelings and to reach out. It’s incredibly understandable that you're feeling angry, anxious, and depressed, especially given the impact of your past relationship and the PTSD you're experiencing. What you're going through is *very* complex and valid. Let's break this down and explore some ways to approach this.

**1. Validating Your Feelings:**

* **It's Okay to Feel This Way:** First and foremost, please know that your feelings are completely understandable. Trauma, particularly from a relationship, can have profound and long-lasting effects. Anger, anxiety, and depression are common reactions to the pain and disruption caused by the experience.  Don't minimize or judge yourself for feeling this way.
* **PTSD is Real:** You've identified PTSD, and that's a crucial first step. It’s not just about the relationship itself, but also about the *way* it was experienced – the fear, the uncertainty, the feeling of being unsafe.
* **You’re Not Alone:** Many people experience similar feelings after difficult relationships, and many have successfully navigated recovery.

**2. Immediate Steps You Can Take:**

* **Safety First:** Are you currently in a safe environment? If you’re experiencing intense feelings that are making you feel unsafe (thoughts of harming yourself or others), please reach out for immediate help. Here are some resources:
    * **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741

    * **911:** If you are in immediate danger.
* **Grounding Techniques:** When you're feeling overwhelmed, grounding techniques can help bring you back to the present moment. Here are a few:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Focus on slow, deep breaths. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 6 seconds.
    * **Sensory Focus:**  Hold an ice cube, focus on the coldness, or listen to calming music.
* **Self-Care (Start Small):**  Even small acts of self-care can make a difference. This doesn't have to be huge – it could be a warm bath, a cup of tea, or spending 15 minutes reading.
* **Limit Triggers:**  If possible, identify things that are triggering your feelings (people, places, memories) and try to limit your exposure to them, at least initially.

**3. Seeking Professional Help – This is Key:**

* **Therapy is Crucial:**  Working with a therapist who specializes in trauma and/or relationship issues is *highly* recommended. They can help you:
    * **Process the Trauma:**  Explore the events of the relationship and how they impacted you.
    * **Develop Coping Mechanisms:**  Learn healthy ways to manage your anger, anxiety, and depression.
    * **Address PTSD Symptoms:**  Receive evidence-based therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), or Trauma-Focused CBT.

1514,"I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with. It was brief and turned into us being just good friends.
   I spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend. Was i wrong?","Depends on your definition of ""wrong"" on this one. Was it objectively wrong to spend the weekend with a good friend, who also happens to be an ex? Probably not. But, it upset your current boyfriend, and he is entitled to his feelings if you are in a relationship with him. He may be out of line if he assumes that anything happened between you and your ex that would compromise the relationship, however your boyfriend being upset might also mean that he wanted to spend that kind of weekend with you and did not get to do that.Long story short, it might help your relationship to understand more, and be curious, not judge-y, around what is upsetting for him. Perhaps having empathy for his experience of the behavior could help him to feel more secure with you having relationships with your ex(es).","Okay, this is a really common and understandably tricky situation! Let's break it down. The short answer is: **it's complicated, and you weren't necessarily *wrong*, but your actions likely caused hurt and created a problem in your current relationship.**

Here's a more detailed explanation:

**Why you weren't *wrong*:**

* **You had a history:** You *were* once in a romantic relationship. It’s natural to maintain a connection with someone you’ve shared a significant history with, even if it’s now just friendship.  It's understandable to enjoy his company and have a comfortable dynamic.
* **Good Friends is Valid:**  A ""good friend"" status is perfectly acceptable. It doesn’t automatically mean something more was desired or intended.
* **He Initiated the Weekend:** The fact that he invited you to spend the weekend is important. He clearly valued your friendship and wanted to spend time with you.


**Why it upset your boyfriend and why you need to address it:**

* **Jealousy and Insecurity:** Your boyfriend's reaction suggests he may be feeling jealous, insecure, or worried about your connection with your ex. This is a very common reaction, and it doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't trust you. It could be a deeper-seated insecurity.
* **Boundaries in Your Relationship:** The key issue here is about *boundaries* within your current relationship.  Even though you're good friends with your ex, your boyfriend has a right to feel secure and comfortable in your relationship.  Spending an entire weekend with your ex, without discussing it with him first, can feel like a breach of that trust.
* **Lack of Communication:** The biggest problem here is the lack of communication.  You didn't talk to your boyfriend about your plans to spend time with your ex.  Open communication is *crucial* in any relationship, especially when dealing with past relationships.

**What you should do now:**

1. **Talk to Your Boyfriend:** This is the most important step.  Have an honest and open conversation with him.  Acknowledge his feelings. Say something like: ""I understand that you were upset when I spent the weekend with [ex's name]. I didn't intend to make you feel insecure, and I apologize if my actions did. I value our relationship and want to make sure we're on the same page about how we handle our friendships.""
2. **Explain Your Perspective (Briefly):** You can briefly explain that you enjoy your friendship with him and that it's a comfortable relationship, but emphasize that it doesn't diminish your feelings for your boyfriend.
3. **Discuss Boundaries (Together):**  This is where you need to establish clear boundaries *together*.  You can discuss how you both feel comfortable with maintaining the friendship with your ex.  Maybe you agree to limit contact, or perhaps you'll talk about it together if you plan to spend time with him.
4. **Reassure Him:**  Reiterate your commitment to your boyfriend and your desire to strengthen your relationship.

**Important Note:**  Don't get defensive. Listen to your boyfriend's concerns and validate his feelings, even if you don't fully understand them.

**To help me give you even more tailored advice, could you tell me a little more about:**

*   **How long have you been together with your boyfriend?**
*   **How long ago was the relationship with your ex?**
*   **How did the relationship with your ex end?** (Was it amicable? Did it end badly?)
*   **How does your boyfriend typically handle jealousy or insecurity?**",0.49654221534729004

952,"I was raped a couple months ago, Since then, along with other unfortunately events that have occurred, I have been having trouble feeling emotions. It's almost as if I'm a sociopath lacking any feeling. What can I do to change this?","You are describing a very legitimate reaction to trauma.  Rape is an aweful experience and I am very sorry that happened to you.  When horrible things happen, people often react in a way that interferes with the ability to live a normal life and function the way they did in the past.  This is very common and the goal is to help you manage the stress caused by dealing with negative events and with help you can regain emotional well-being.  This is especially important if you have had more than one negative thing happen.  Oftentimes, the unconscious reaction is to become numb and avoid all feelings, especially if more than one negative event occurred.  A big part of what causes people trouble are feelings of guilt.  We often blame ourselves when bad things happen. It is actually difficult to comprehend the concept that we don't always have control of what happens in life.  In addition, when you mentioned feeling like a sociopath, it sounded like you feel like your reaction is wrong.  The first thing you can do is realize that your feelings and reactions are o.k., you aren't doing anything wrong, and nothing is wrong with you.  The next step is to start dealing with the impact of these traumatic experiences. Identifying your feelings, and knowing the thoughts and beliefs that are behind those emotions can help you regain your sense of happiness.  Research shows that understanding and expressing those thoughts and feelings can help.  If doesn't sound like you need to do anything to change yourself, but talking to a counselor can be helpful in managing your reaction to a incredibly traumatic experience.  I hope this helps you understand your feelings and can get to a place where you enjoy life.","Okay, thank you so much for reaching out and sharing this incredibly difficult experience. What you're describing – feeling emotionally detached after trauma, and describing it as feeling like a ""sociopath"" – is a very common and understandably distressing reaction. It’s incredibly brave of you to acknowledge this and seek help. Let’s address this with care and understanding.

**First, let's be very clear: You are not a sociopath.** The feeling of emotional numbness you're experiencing is a complex response to trauma. Trauma profoundly impacts the brain and nervous system, and it can manifest in many ways, including a reduced ability to feel emotions, difficulty connecting with others, and a sense of disconnection.  It’s a survival mechanism, a way your brain is trying to protect you from overwhelming pain. It doesn’t mean you’re inherently a bad person.

**Here’s a breakdown of what’s likely happening and what you can do:**

**1. Understanding the Trauma Response:**

* **Dissociation:** This is a key element. When trauma occurs, your brain can literally dissociate – detach – from the experience to cope with the intensity. This can lead to feeling like you’re watching yourself from outside your body, or feeling detached from your emotions.
* **Fight, Flight, Freeze, Fawn:** Trauma can activate the body's stress response system (the sympathetic nervous system). This can lead to a shutdown of feelings to conserve energy.
* **Neuroplasticity:** The good news is your brain is incredibly adaptable (neuroplasticity).  With focused effort, you *can* rewire your brain and regain emotional regulation.

**2. What You Can Do - Immediate Steps:**

* **Prioritize Safety and Self-Care:** This is absolutely crucial.
    * **Grounding Techniques:** Learn and practice grounding techniques to bring you back to the present moment when you feel overwhelmed. Some examples include:
        * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Name 5 things you see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
        * **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system.
        * **Sensory Focus:**  Hold an ice cube, listen to calming music, or focus on the feeling of your feet on the ground.
    * **Establish a Routine:**  Structure can provide a sense of safety and control.
    * **Healthy Diet, Sleep, and Exercise:** These are foundational for mental health.
* **Seek Professional Help – This is Essential:**
    * **Trauma-Focused Therapy:**  Specifically, therapies like:
        * **EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing):**  This is a highly effective therapy for processing traumatic memories.
        * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Can help you identify and change negative thought patterns.
        * **Trauma-Informed Therapy:**  A general approach that recognizes the impact of trauma and provides a safe and supportive environment.
        * **Narrative Therapy:** Helps you re-author your story and regain control.
    * **Find a Therapist Who Specializes in Trauma:**  It’s vital to work with someone who understands the complexities of trauma and has experience with this type of response. You can ask potential therapists about their experience with trauma and their approach to treatment.

**3. Addressing Your Feelings of Detachment:**

* **Start Small:** Don’t try to force yourself to feel intensely. Begin by noticing small emotions – a flicker of sadness, a brief moment of joy.
* **Journaling:**  Writing about your thoughts and feelings can help you process them.
* **Connect with Supportive People:**  While it may feel difficult, reaching out to trusted friends or family members can provide support.  However, be mindful of who you choose – someone who will be understanding and non-judgmental.
* **Creative Expression:**  Engage in activities like art, music, or writing that allow you to express your emotions in a non-verbal way.

1896,"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?",If you connect with your therapist and can say whatever you want to say and not be judged.,"Okay, let's tackle this – finding the right therapist and then how to effectively work with them. It’s fantastic that you're thinking about this proactively; it's a crucial part of the therapeutic process.

**1. How Do You Know You Have the Right Therapist?**

There's no magic formula, but here’s a breakdown of key indicators:

* **Initial Connection (The ""Gut Feeling""):** This is huge. Do you feel *seen* and *heard* in the first session? Do you feel like they’re genuinely interested in understanding you? This isn’t about instant friendship, but a basic sense of safety and rapport is vital.
* **Therapeutic Alliance:** This is a research-backed term describing the relationship between you and your therapist. It’s built on trust, collaboration, and a shared commitment to your goals.  Signs of a strong alliance include:
    * **Open Communication:**  Do you feel comfortable expressing your thoughts and feelings, even the difficult ones?
    * **Respect:** Do they respect your boundaries, values, and perspective?
    * **Collaboration:** Are you involved in setting goals and deciding on the direction of treatment?
* **Therapist’s Expertise & Approach:**
    * **Specialization:** Do they have experience working with the specific issues you're facing (e.g., anxiety, depression, trauma, relationship problems)?
    * **Theoretical Orientation:**  Do you resonate with their approach (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Psychodynamic Therapy, Humanistic Therapy)? It's okay if you don't fully understand it, but a basic understanding can help.
    * **Credentials:**  Check their qualifications (Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC), Licensed Psychologist (PhD/PsyD)).
* **You Feel Challenged & Supported:**  Therapy should push you a little – helping you examine your patterns and beliefs. But it shouldn’t feel overwhelming or judgmental. You should feel supported in your growth.
* **Progress (Eventually!):**  This might take time, but you should start to notice changes in your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

**2. How to ""Train"" Your Therapist**

Think of it less like ""training"" and more like establishing a strong collaborative partnership. Here’s how:

* **Be Clear About Your Goals:**  Don’t just say, “I want to feel better.”  Get specific.  ""I want to be able to manage my anxiety in social situations,"" or ""I want to improve my communication with my partner."" Write these down.
* **Provide Feedback (Constructively):** This is *essential*.
    * **Session Summaries:** At the end of each session, you can say, ""Just to make sure I’m understanding, can you summarize what we discussed today and how it relates to my goal of [your goal]?""
    * **Honest Reactions:**  ""That approach didn’t feel helpful to me today,"" or “I’m struggling with that exercise – could we try something different?”
    * **Focus on Impact:**  Instead of saying, “You’re not listening,” try, “I felt like I wasn’t fully heard when I was talking about [specific topic].  Could we explore that more?”
* **Ask Questions:**  Don’t be afraid to ask your therapist to explain their reasoning, the techniques they’re using, or how it connects to your goals. ""Can you explain why you think this technique will be helpful in this situation?""
* **Suggest Alternative Approaches (Gently):** ""I’ve read about [technique] and I was wondering if that might be something we could explore.""  Frame it as a question, not a criticism.
* **Regularly Revisit Goals:**  Therapy isn’t static.  Check in periodically to ensure your goals are still relevant and that your approach is still working.
* **Be Patient:** Building a strong therapeutic relationship takes time.  It’s normal to have adjustments and shifts in direction.

**Important Notes:**

* **It’s Okay to Shop Around:** If you don’t feel a connection with your first therapist, it’s perfectly acceptable to find someone else.  It’s a crucial relationship, and you deserve to have one that works for you.
* **Therapist's Role:** Remember, your therapist is a guide, not a dictator. They offer expertise and techniques, but ultimately, *you* are driving the process.
* **Don’t Be Afraid to Advocate for Yourself:** You are the expert on your own experience.

2775,"I am not sure if I am depressed. I don't know how to bring it up to my parents, and that makes me miserable.","Depending on your relationship with your parents, inviting them to have a conversation might be a good first step.  If they consent then you can have the opportunity to discuss your concerns with them.  Inviting someone to a conversation and getting their agreement is a great first step. I would then make sure your location of the discussion is conducive to the conversation and once all that is considered it might be beneficial that you make a list of your concerns prior to the meeting.  this can help keep you on point. ","Okay, let's tackle this. It's incredibly brave of you to recognize you're feeling miserable and to reach out, even just in this way. It’s completely understandable to feel unsure about whether you're depressed, and even more daunting to think about talking to your parents about it. Let’s break this down and find a path forward.

**1. Understanding Your Feelings - Is it Depression?**

It’s really common to feel confused when you’re struggling with your mental health. Depression isn't just feeling sad; it’s a complex condition. Here are some common signs and symptoms – think about whether you've been experiencing several of these for more than two weeks:

* **Persistent Sadness or Hopelessness:**  Do you often feel down, empty, or like things will never get better?
* **Loss of Interest or Pleasure:** Have you lost interest in activities you used to enjoy?
* **Changes in Appetite or Weight:** Have you noticed a significant increase or decrease in your appetite?
* **Sleep Disturbances:** Are you having trouble sleeping (too much or too little)?
* **Fatigue or Loss of Energy:** Do you feel constantly tired, even after resting?
* **Feelings of Worthlessness or Guilt:** Do you frequently criticize yourself or feel like you're a failure?
* **Difficulty Concentrating or Making Decisions:** Is it hard for you to focus on things, or do you struggle to make simple decisions?
* **Irritability or Restlessness:** Are you feeling more irritable or on edge than usual?
* **Thoughts of Death or Suicide:** *This is a serious symptom. If you are having thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out for help immediately. See the resources at the end of this response.*


**Important Note:**  You don’t need to meet *all* of these criteria to be experiencing depression. Even a few of these symptoms, combined with a feeling of overall unhappiness, can be a sign something is wrong.

**2. Talking to Your Parents – A Difficult Conversation**

This is where it gets really tough. Your parents likely want what’s best for you, but they might not know how to help if they don’t understand what you’re going through. Here's a strategy:

* **Start Small:** You don't have to have a huge, emotional conversation right away. Begin by sharing a small, specific observation. For example, ""Mom, I've been feeling really tired lately, and I've lost interest in playing [hobby].""
* **Use ""I"" Statements:** This focuses on your experience and avoids blaming them. Instead of saying, ""You never listen to me,"" say, ""I feel like I'm not being heard when I talk about how I'm feeling.""
* **Be Honest, But Start Gently:**  You can say something like, “I’ve been struggling with some feelings lately, and I wanted to talk to you about it. It’s hard to describe, but I’ve been feeling a lot of sadness and it’s been affecting my ability to do things I enjoy.”
* **Explain What You Need:**  Tell them what kind of support you'd find helpful.  “It would really help me if you could just listen without judgment,” or “I could really use some help finding someone to talk to.”
* **Prepare for Their Reaction:** They might be confused, dismissive, or even angry. Try to remain calm and reiterate that you're struggling and need their support.  If they're immediately invalidating your feelings, you can say, ""I understand you might not fully understand, but these feelings are real for me.""
* **Don’t Force It:** If the conversation goes badly, it’s okay to take a break and try again later.

291,"People have been calling me names, and I have had enough of it. I cannot stand it anymore I'm done. I have told someone this, and that is why I am writing this. The thoughts are awful.","It's sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed with intrusive thoughts and are feeling very criticized by others as well. I think it is great that you are reaching out and I can tell that you want this to change. Working with a competent therapist may be a good option for getting some more clarity about what is going on, developing ways to cope, and eventually getting relief from these overwhelming experiences.","Okay, it sounds like you're going through an incredibly difficult and painful time. It's completely understandable that you've reached a breaking point after being subjected to hurtful names and the associated thoughts and feelings. The fact that you've told someone and are now writing this shows a huge strength – you're acknowledging the problem and seeking a way to cope. Let's unpack this and explore some ways to deal with what you’re experiencing.

**First, let's validate your feelings.** What you’re feeling is *completely* valid. Being repeatedly called names is damaging. It's a form of abuse, whether intentional or not, and it *does* have a serious impact on your self-worth, your mental health, and your ability to feel safe. The ""awful thoughts"" you're experiencing are a natural response to this trauma. They don't make you a bad person; they're a sign that your mind is struggling to process what's happening.

**Let’s talk about what you've described:**

* **You’ve reached a breaking point:** This is a crucial step. Recognizing you've had enough and deciding to take action is incredibly important.
* **You've told someone:** That's fantastic. Having someone to talk to is a vital part of healing.  It’s good you’ve reached out to someone you trust.
* **""Awful thoughts"":** These thoughts can be incredibly distressing. They might be related to self-doubt, shame, anger, fear, or a sense of hopelessness. It's important to remember that these thoughts don't define you. They are often fueled by the negativity you're experiencing.

**Here’s what you can do, broken down into immediate and longer-term steps:**

**1. Immediate Steps – Managing the Immediate Distress:**

* **Grounding Techniques:** When you’re feeling overwhelmed by the thoughts, try grounding techniques. These help bring you back to the present moment:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:** Focus on slow, deep breaths. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 6 seconds.
* **Remove Yourself:** If you’re in a situation where you’re being targeted, remove yourself immediately.
* **Talk to Someone You Trust:** Reach out to the person you already told – or another trusted friend, family member, or mentor. Just talking about it can help.

**2. Longer-Term Strategies – Building Resilience:**

* **Recognize It’s Not Your Fault:** Repeat this to yourself: ""Their words and actions are a reflection of *them*, not me.""  You are not responsible for the negativity of others.
* **Set Boundaries:** This is *crucial*. You have the right to protect yourself. Think about what boundaries you need to set with the people who are calling you names. This might involve:
    * **Limited Contact:** Reducing or eliminating contact with the individuals.
    * **Direct Communication (if safe):**  “I will not tolerate being spoken to in that way. Please stop.” (Only do this if you feel safe and it won’t escalate the situation).
    * **Walking Away:** Simply leaving the situation.
* **Self-Care:** Prioritize activities that make you feel good and help you relax. This could include:
    * **Hobbies:** Engage in activities you enjoy.
    * **Exercise:** Physical activity can boost your mood.
    * **Healthy Eating:** Nourish your body.
    * **Sleep:** Get enough rest.
* **Challenge Negative Thoughts:** When you have those awful thoughts, try to challenge them. Ask yourself: ""Is this thought based on facts, or is it just a feeling?"" ""What evidence do I have to support this thought?""
* **Seek Professional Support:** This is *highly recommended*. Talking to a therapist or counselor can provide you with tools and strategies to cope with the situation, process your emotions, and build your self-esteem. They can help you understand the root of the problem and develop a plan to move forward.

1537,"I've been with a man for four years. For the last year, he has said he is done, but he still talks, texts, visits, and has not moved on with anyone else. His words do not match his actions. I love this man, but it's hurting so much.","This can be difficult and confusing.If you think your boyfriend would be open to having a discussion, try asking him for a time when he is willing to have an important discussion. When that time matches with a time that is good for you, try discussing the type of relationship that you each want to have and what you can start and stop doing to get there. He may want to be really good friends. He may also be trying to figure out what he is feeling. If you end up talking over one another, try letting one person be the one who is talking about their feelings for about five minutes and during that time, try having the other person asked questions to gain more understanding of their experience. Then you can switch. Also consider asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no, but lead to more explanations.Questions that start with the words how, what, when, who are usually better than questions starting with ""why"" because they can be emotional triggers for some people.If this is difficult to do between the two of you, consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couples.","Okay, this is a *really* tough situation, and it’s completely understandable that you're hurting so deeply. What you're describing – a long-term relationship where he's repeatedly told you he's done, yet continues to engage with you – is incredibly confusing and painful. It’s a classic example of emotional manipulation and can be incredibly damaging to your self-worth. Let’s break this down and explore how you can navigate this:

**1. Understanding What's Happening:**

* **He's Likely Testing the Waters:** His continued contact, despite saying he's done, suggests he’s enjoying the attention, the possibility of a rekindling, or perhaps testing your boundaries. He might be enjoying the drama and the fact that you're still invested.
* **He's Not Respecting Your Boundaries:** You've clearly communicated that you're done. His actions are actively disregarding that communication. This isn’t about love; it's about control.
* **He Might Be Avoiding Closure:** It can be incredibly difficult for people to truly let go of a relationship, even if they intellectually know they should. He might be clinging to the familiarity and the comfort of the past.
* **It’s Not About You (Ultimately):** While you might feel like his behavior is *about* you, it’s often rooted in his own unresolved feelings, insecurities, or need for control.  Don't fall into the trap of thinking you're the problem.

**2. How You're Feeling is Valid:**

* **Betrayal:** You're experiencing profound betrayal. His words and actions are directly contradictory, and that creates a deep sense of hurt and confusion.
* **Confusion:** It’s completely normal to feel confused. You’re trying to reconcile his words with his behavior, and that’s exhausting.
* **Self-Doubt:** It’s common to start questioning yourself – “Am I too sensitive?” “Am I holding onto something?” – but *do not* let him make you doubt your feelings or your judgment.
* **Pain & Sadness:** Allow yourself to feel the pain. Suppressing your emotions will only prolong the healing process.

**3. What You Need to Do (Prioritize Your Wellbeing):**

* **Reinforce Your Boundaries – Firmly & Clearly:** This is *crucial*. You need to stop responding to his attempts to engage. This means:
    * **Don't answer calls, texts, or emails.** (Seriously, don't.)
    * **Block him on social media.** (This is essential to prevent you from seeing his updates and feeling like you're part of his life.)
    * **If he shows up at your place, politely but firmly tell him you've moved on and ask him to leave.**
* **No Justifications:** Don't try to explain yourself to him. He’s not listening to your reasons for wanting to move on.
* **Focus on Self-Care:** This is the most important thing.  Invest in yourself:
    * **Lean on your support system:** Talk to trusted friends and family.
    * **Engage in activities you enjoy:**  Reconnect with hobbies, spend time with loved ones, and do things that bring you joy.
    * **Practice self-compassion:** Be kind to yourself. You’re going through a difficult situation, and you deserve to be treated with respect and understanding.
* **Consider Therapy:** Talking to a therapist can provide you with support, guidance, and tools to process your emotions and develop healthy coping mechanisms.

**4. Important Reminders:**

* **You Deserve Respect:** You deserve to be treated with respect and honesty. This relationship is not honoring that.
* **You Can't Change Him:** You can only control your own actions and reactions.
* **Healing Takes Time:** There’s no quick fix. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself to grieve the loss of what you thought this relationship could be.

1442,"I'm applying to private high schools. I'm playing basketball on my school team currently, and I love it. I also play on a team that I've hated since the beginning, and I finally want to quit before the season gets started. However, my parents say I can play on either both teams or neither. I think it's unfair because it's up to me if I want to play for a certain team. I was planning on playing basketball for the high school I get into, but if that means continuing to play for the team I hate, then I wouldn't want to play in high school. Now I don't know what to do! My parents are threatening to send me off to a different home if I don't play. I just want to run away.","The situation in your family seems to place unnecessary pressure on you.Are you and your parents able to talk together about their reason for their standard?Are your parents willing to listen to your reasons to not play on the team you hate?If yes, then maybe some type of compromise is possible for all of you to negotiate.If none of the above is possible, then you may want to get specific and direct advice from a professional, such as the school guidance counselor or psychologist, whom you'd trust and feel safe in talking.I hope you and your parents will find an answer that all of you are happy to accept.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it sounds incredibly stressful and overwhelming for you. It’s completely understandable why you’re feeling this way – you’re caught between wanting to pursue your passion, your family's expectations, and a feeling of being controlled. Let’s break this down and figure out how to approach it.

**1. Validate Your Feelings – You’re Not Wrong to Feel This Way**

First and foremost, you’re absolutely justified in feeling frustrated, angry, and powerless. It’s *your* passion, *your* body, and *your* future. It’s completely reasonable to feel like your voice isn't being heard, especially when it comes to something you’re invested in. The threat of being sent away is a really serious and frightening escalation, and it's okay to feel like you want to escape that.

**2. Understanding Your Parents’ Perspective (Without Accepting Their Threat)**

Your parents likely believe they're acting in your best interest. They might be:

* **Worried about commitment:** They might believe consistent participation is important for college scouts or future opportunities.
* **Trying to avoid conflict:** They could be trying to avoid a major argument and maintain peace.
* **Misunderstanding your feelings:** They might not fully grasp how much you dislike the team.

However, their solution of letting you play both or neither is not a solution *for you*. It doesn’t address your core desire to play basketball on a team you enjoy and that aligns with your goals.

**3. Calm Communication is Key (Even Though It's Hard)**

You need to have a serious conversation with your parents. Here's a plan:

* **Choose the Right Time:** Pick a time when everyone is relatively calm and can talk without distractions.
* **Start with Empathy:** ""Mom and Dad, I understand you want what's best for me, and I appreciate you wanting me to be serious about basketball.""
* **Clearly State Your Feelings:** “But I’m feeling really frustrated because I don't want to play for a team I don't enjoy. It’s important to me to play basketball, and I want to do it in a way that motivates me and helps me grow.”
* **Explain Your Reasoning:** “Playing for the team I hate is actually making me dread basketball. It’s not helping me improve or enjoy the sport. I'm worried it will discourage me from playing in high school.”
* **Present Your Vision:** ""I want to play basketball in high school, and I want to do it on a team where I can thrive. I'm willing to work hard and be committed, but it has to be a team I'm passionate about.”
* **Address the Threat:** This is crucial. ""The threat of going to a different home is really scary for me. It makes me feel like my voice doesn’t matter. I need you to trust that I can make responsible decisions about my basketball future.""

**4. Suggest Alternatives (and Stand Your Ground)**

* **Focus on High School Team:** “I’m committed to trying out for the high school team. I want to show you that I’m serious and dedicated.”
* **Discuss Expectations:** ""Let’s talk about what you expect from me in terms of commitment to the high school team.""
* **Explore Options Together:**  ""Can we talk about what would make you feel comfortable with me playing basketball? Perhaps we can discuss my training schedule and how I can demonstrate my dedication.""

**5. Seek Support – You Don't Have to Do This Alone**

* **Talk to a Counselor:** Your school counselor can help you navigate this situation and provide strategies for communication.
* **Trusted Adult:** Is there another adult you trust – a coach, teacher, relative – who can mediate or offer support?
* **Mental Health Support:** If you're feeling overwhelmed or experiencing anxiety, consider talking to a therapist.

**6. Regarding the Threat – This is Serious**

The threat of being sent away is a form of emotional abuse. It's important to recognize this and seek help.  Talk to a trusted adult about this.

**Important Note:** Your parents’ reaction is their responsibility.  You are not responsible for their behavior.

3193,"Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes  I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I can't get it out.  How can I stop these thoughts?","Hi there,I first want to let you know that having these thoughts is completely normal. Studies have been done that show that 80% of human thoughts are ""negative"" so you are not alone. I like to think of thoughts as a tornado... if you are in a tornado, you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial. However, when you are, let's say, a mile away from a tornado, it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as get shelter or make sure your family and friends are safe. When unhelpful or scary thoughts arise, we tend to start a ""war"" with them, which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado. This makes the thoughts and emotions bigger and intensifies the feelings that go with them. So the question I imagine you have is ""how do I get out of the tornado?"" There are 3 steps to doing this:Get distance from your thoughts by adding ""I am noticing I'm having the thought that...."" to the front of them. For example, ""I am noticing I am having the thought that something bad is going to happen to me.""   The purpose of this is not to decrease your fear or get rid of the thought. These thoughts might always be there and that is okay because that is how the mind naturally works so struggling with that is a waste of time and energy. The purpose is to gain some distance from the thoughts so you don't get swept away by them. You can imagine them floating along like leaves in a stream or clouds in the sky (and often the same thought will come back again and again but that's okay... just continue to notice it with curiosity). I imagine the thoughts get in your way of doing what really matters to you so if you can get a little bit of distance, you can do things that are fulfilling and meaningful to you. Tune into your body and notice what sensations come up and where you feel them most intensely. Then breathe into them and make room for them. Our 5 main emotions are: joy, sadness, fear/anxiety, shame, and anger. ALL of these emotions are part of being human and there is no escaping them. So again, struggling with them ends up intensifying them. Instead, let them be and make a little bit of room for them. Often a side effect of this is the intensity will decrease but it might not. The purpose is to keep them from becoming more intense. Contact the present moment. Notice what is happening here and now. One way of doing this is tuning into the five senses. What are some things you hear, see, taste, smell, and feel? Another way is to notice what is happening in your body (without trying to change it). How deep are your breaths, what is happening with your heart rate, are you cold/warm, etc?Implementing these three steps can help you to refrain from getting caught up in your unhelpful thoughts. Unfortunately there is no way to get rid of thoughts or feelings completely. So the only option that works in the long run is to accept them while continuing to do what matters to you and what is fulfilling to you.I hope this helps!","Okay, it sounds like you're dealing with a really challenging experience – intrusive, distressing thoughts that loop and feel incredibly overwhelming. You're not alone; many people experience this, and it's fantastic that you're recognizing it and wanting to find ways to manage it. Let’s break down how you can approach this.

**1. Understanding What's Happening:**

* **Intrusive Thoughts Are Common:** It’s important to know that having intrusive thoughts – thoughts that are upsetting, disturbing, or unwanted – is actually quite common. They don't necessarily mean you're a bad person or that you *want* to have these thoughts.  They're often a sign of a highly active mind.
* **Anxiety and Worry:** These thoughts are often linked to anxiety. Anxiety can create a heightened state of alert, making you more susceptible to noticing and dwelling on potential threats.
* **Not a Reflection of Reality:** It’s crucial to remember that these thoughts are *thoughts*, not predictions. They’re based on fears and worries, but they don’t represent what *will* happen.

**2. Immediate Strategies to Interrupt the Cycle:**

* **The ""Grey Rock"" Technique:** This is a really effective technique for interrupting a looping thought. When you notice the thought, don't engage with it.  Imagine yourself becoming incredibly boring – a grey rock.  Don't react, don't analyze, don't try to fight the thought. Just acknowledge it neutrally (""Okay, there's a thought about X"") and then deliberately shift your attention.
* **Thought Stopping:** Say ""Stop!"" firmly to yourself (either silently or out loud). You can pair this with a physical action, like snapping a rubber band on your wrist or tapping your finger. This is most effective when practiced consistently.
* **Distraction:** Immediately shift your focus to something else. This could be:
    * **Physical Activity:**  Go for a walk, do some jumping jacks, dance.
    * **Engaging Activity:**  Read a book, play a game, work on a hobby.
    * **Sensory Activities:**  Take a warm bath, listen to calming music, smell essential oils.
* **Grounding Techniques:** These help bring you back to the present moment:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.

**3. Longer-Term Strategies & Building Resilience:**

* **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** CBT is a highly effective therapy for anxiety and intrusive thoughts. It helps you identify and challenge negative thought patterns. A therapist can teach you specific techniques to manage your thoughts.
* **Mindfulness Meditation:** Mindfulness helps you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without judgment. It teaches you to observe your thoughts as passing events, rather than getting swept away by them. There are many apps and guided meditations available (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer).
* **Relaxation Techniques:** Practice techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or yoga to reduce overall anxiety levels.
* **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and identify patterns.
* **Challenge Negative Thoughts:** When you have an intrusive thought, ask yourself:
    * ""What evidence do I have to support this thought?""
    * ""What's the worst that could *realistically* happen?""
    * ""What's a more balanced or realistic way to view this situation?""

**4. Important Considerations & When to Seek Professional Help:**

* **Don't Suppress:** Trying to completely suppress your thoughts can actually make them worse.
* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself. It takes time and effort to manage intrusive thoughts. Don’t beat yourself up for having them.
* **Talk to Someone You Trust:** Sharing your experience with a trusted friend or family member can provide support and reduce feelings of isolation.

**When to Seek Professional Help:**

* **If the thoughts are frequent and distressing.**
* **If the thoughts are interfering with your daily life (work, relationships, sleep).**
* **If you're having thoughts of harming yourself or others.**  (This is a serious situation – please reach out for help immediately.)

2605,"I started dating my fiancé two years ago. My first cousin is married to my fiancé’s sister. There has always been a communication issue between my uncle and aunt and my cousin and his wife. My uncle goes to my mom instead of talking to my cousin, and it upsets my mom.","Based on the information provided, this is an issue with boundaries.   Sounds like your uncle goes to your mom and possibly your mother takes the issues to you.  I do not like to assume so I will direct you to information regarding families dealing with enmeshment and triangulation.  Enmeshment is the concept of diffused boundaries in families and other personal relationships.  Triangulation is two individuals relaying information to a third party what cannot be said directly to each other.  From someone who has dealt with both these issues on a personal level, being informed about family dynamics is beneficial and can help you develop healthy boundaries for yourself within your family structure.  You may need assistance with developing healthy boundaries.  Although it is possible, it is not easy to change the way you have been operating for any extended amount of time.  Hope this help!","Okay, this is a really common and tricky family dynamic! It sounds like you've got a layered situation with a budding relationship, a complicated family history, and a potential source of stress for your mom. Let's break down what's happening and explore some potential approaches.

**Understanding the Dynamics:**

* **Generational Differences & Communication Styles:** Your uncle and aunt likely have different ways of communicating. Your mom might be used to direct, frank conversations, while they might prefer a more subtle or indirect approach. This can lead to misunderstandings and frustration.
* **Established Patterns:** Twenty years of this dynamic has likely established a pattern. Your mom probably has a certain expectation of how family members should communicate, and this expectation isn't being met.
* **Your Mom’s Emotional Investment:** Your mom is clearly invested in this situation. Her frustration isn’t just about the arguments themselves; it’s about feeling like she's not being included or respected in a key family relationship.
* **Your Fiancé’s Role:** Your fiancé is caught in the middle. He needs to navigate his family’s history while also building a relationship with you.

**What You Can Do (and What You Can't):**

1. **Talk to Your Mom (with empathy):** This is the most crucial step.
   * **Validate Her Feelings:** Start by saying something like, ""Mom, I can see how frustrating this is for you. It's completely understandable that you're upset when you feel like [Uncle] isn't talking to [Cousin] directly.""
   * **Ask Her What She Needs:** “What would make this situation better for you? Do you just want to be kept in the loop, or do you want me to help facilitate a conversation?”
   * **Don’t Take Sides:** Resist the urge to get in the middle of their arguments. Your role is to support your mom, not to mediate.
   * **Reassure Her:** ""I love you, and I want to make sure you feel heard and respected within the family.""

2. **Talk to Your Fiancé (Openly and Honestly):**
   * **Explain the Situation:**  ""I've noticed there's a long-standing issue between your uncle and cousin, and it's causing Mom some stress. I want to be supportive of her.""
   * **Discuss How He Handles It:**  “How does he usually handle this? Does he talk to your mom about it, or does he just avoid it?”
   * **Collaborate on a Strategy:**  ""How can we work together to support Mom while also respecting your family's dynamics?""

3. **Your Fiancé Talking to His Family (Potentially):**  This is delicate. He could gently (and only if he feels comfortable and it won't escalate things) say something like, ""Uncle, I know there's been some tension between you and [Cousin]. It would be great if you could talk to each other directly. Mom is really invested in your relationship, and it would make her feel more comfortable if you could resolve this.""  *However, he needs to be prepared for this to be met with resistance.*

4. **Setting Boundaries (For Yourself):** This is important. You don’t have to get drawn into the arguments.  If your mom starts venting about it to you, you can say something like, “Mom, I hear you’re upset, but I’m not going to get involved in this argument. Let’s talk about something else.”

5. **Accept What You Can't Control:**  You can’t force your uncle and cousin to communicate. You can't change their history. Focus on what *you* can do – supporting your mom and managing your own reactions.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Don't Expect Miracles:** This dynamic is deeply ingrained. Don’t expect a quick fix.
* **Be Patient:**  Changing entrenched patterns takes time and effort.
* **Focus on Your Relationship:**  While this family situation is important, prioritize building a strong and healthy relationship with your fiancé.

**To help me give you even more tailored advice, could you tell me a little more about:**

*   **What kind of arguments are they having?** (e.g., about money, politics, lifestyle choices, etc.)
*   **What is your mom’s typical reaction when she’s upset?** (e.g., does she complain to you, does she try to talk to her siblings, etc.)
*   **What is your fiancé’s personality like?** (e.g., is he direct, avoids conflict, etc.)",0.4742777347564697
879,"In 2008 my former husband of 14 years walked away from my life and we've been separated ever since. We have always been together sexually and both have experienced sleeping with others. I stopped because I wanted my marriage to work out but he did not. If he stops sleeping with other women, can our marriage be saved? Or should we just part ways? I still care deeply about him after all that I did and he has done. But he is seeing someone else on and off for years now. Will our marriage still be saved if he decides that he wants to try to do so?","Sorry to hear about the stress in your relationship.  There is definite value in being clear as you are, about your own emotional investment in your husband and that you expect sexual exclusivity from him as part of the foundation of your marriage.Also positive is your awareness that only your husband is the one who must similarly decide his own standards of being sexually exclusive to you, or not.Whether your marriage can be saved depends on what each person is willing to accept about the other one.Is sleeping with other women the only criterion of what will satisfy you about being together with your husband?Love and care are not enough to make a marriage work. Partners need to be able to compromise and cooperate with each other. That you care for him definitely intensifies any emotion you feel toward your husband.  It intensifies any frustration and sadness about the relationship too.Decide how much emotional sadness and hurt you're willing to tolerate and the reason you're willing to do so.From what you write, you are being very generous of yourself and not being reciprocated for this.If your husband doesn't start taking steps toward satisfying your wishes, this may be your time to question your own generosity in waiting for him to do so.","Okay, this is a profoundly complex and painful situation, and it’s completely understandable that you're grappling with these questions. Let's break this down with honesty and a realistic perspective.

**1. The Foundation of Your Situation:**

* **Long Separation:** 14 years of separation is a *massive* amount of time. Relationships change dramatically over that period. The shared history is significant, but it doesn’t automatically guarantee a future.
* **Past Behavior:** You've rightly identified the core issue: his ongoing infidelity. This isn't just a single event; it's a pattern of behavior that has fundamentally eroded trust – the very bedrock of a marriage.
* **Your Role & His Role:** You stopped sleeping with other women because you wanted to save the marriage. He didn't. This difference in commitment is a critical factor.
* **His Current Infidelity:** The fact that he’s continuing to see someone else, despite your efforts and the length of your separation, is a huge red flag. It suggests he isn't willing to fully commit to you or address the underlying issues that led to the initial separation.

**2. Can Your Marriage Be Saved if He Stops Sleeping with Others?**

* **It's Possible, But Extremely Difficult:**  Stopping the outside relationships *could* be a step towards rebuilding, but it’s not a guaranteed fix. It would be a necessary first step, but it wouldn't erase the damage done.
* **Trust is a Long-Term Process:** Rebuilding trust after years of infidelity is an incredibly slow and arduous process. It requires consistent, demonstrable effort from *him*. This means him being fully transparent, being willing to answer incredibly difficult questions, and consistently showing you he is committed to you.
* **It Requires *Both* Parties:** You would also need to be willing to engage in intensive therapy – both individually and as a couple. You'd need to address your own hurt, anger, and insecurities, and he would need to take full responsibility for his actions and demonstrate genuine remorse and a commitment to change.

**3. Should You Part Ways?**

* **Given the Circumstances, It's a Valid Consideration:** Honestly, with his continued infidelity and the long-term damage it’s caused, it's perfectly reasonable to seriously consider ending the relationship.  Staying out of a place of hope when there's no clear path to healing is often more painful in the long run.
* **Protecting Your Wellbeing:** Your emotional and mental health are paramount.  It's okay to prioritize your own happiness and peace of mind.

**4. What If He *Does* Want to Try?**

* **Demand Accountability:** If he expresses a desire to try, you *must* set clear boundaries and expectations *before* engaging in any conversations about rebuilding. This includes:
    * **Complete Transparency:** He needs to be willing to share everything – location, communication, etc.
    * **Commitment to Therapy:**  Both of you *must* agree to couples therapy.
    * **No More Infidelity:** This is non-negotiable.
* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:**  If he doesn't meet these conditions, or if he reverts back to his old behavior, you *must* be prepared to end the relationship. Don't get sucked back into a cycle of hope and disappointment.

**Important Considerations & Recommendations:**

* **Individual Therapy:**  Regardless of whether you attempt to rebuild the marriage, individual therapy for you is *crucial*. You need to process your emotions, develop healthy coping mechanisms, and build self-esteem.
* **Couples Therapy (If Pursued):**  If you decide to try couples therapy, find a therapist specializing in infidelity recovery.
* **Don’t Minimize Your Feelings:**  Your feelings of hurt, betrayal, and confusion are valid. Allow yourself to feel them and seek support.

1697,"I've been going through a rough time lately. I been into nothing but women. I’ve never thought about men until a week ago. I’m very upset and depressed about this. It's not normal to me. I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that I’m not gay. I get the same results each time, and I feel disgust. This is tough on me. I'm scared that I looked too many times. I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.","Are you able to give yourself some peace of mind while you take the time to further address whether or not you are gay?Whether or not and to what degree a person accepts their sexuality, depends on dense factors such as the culture of your family, the beliefs about gay people with which you were brought up, and your own tolerance for being a unique individual.Examining these factors, whether inwardly by yourself, in online blogs and sites, or live with other people, requires patience and effort.The more you are willing to commit to figuring out your own truth, the greater is your chance of finding it!","Okay, thank you for sharing this with me. It takes a lot of courage to talk about something so personal and unsettling. What you're experiencing sounds incredibly distressing, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling upset, depressed, and scared. Let's break this down and address each part of what you've described.

**1. The Shift in Attraction:**

It’s really common for attractions to shift and evolve over time. Our feelings aren’t always fixed, and it’s perfectly normal for someone to experience a change in their attraction to different genders. The fact that you've spent a significant period primarily attracted to women and then suddenly find yourself drawn to men is something many people go through. It doesn’t automatically mean you *are* gay, but it does indicate a change in your feelings, which is valid and can be confusing.

**2. The Porn Consumption and Disgust:**

The behavior you describe – repeatedly looking at gay porn to ""prove"" something – is often a sign of deep-seated anxiety and a feeling of being disconnected from your own feelings. The fact that you're experiencing disgust after seeing it suggests that this behavior is unsettling you profoundly. It’s a clear indication that you're grappling with a significant internal conflict.  The act of trying to *disprove* a feeling is often a misguided attempt to control something that's already shifting.  The more you try to suppress a feeling, the more powerful it can become.

**3. The Anxiety and Shaking:**

The physical symptoms you're describing – shaking, racing thoughts – are consistent with anxiety. It's your body reacting to a situation that feels overwhelming and uncertain. It’s a natural response to feeling confused and struggling with your identity.

**4. What This Doesn’t Mean:**

*   **You're not ""broken.""** This isn't a pathology. It’s a complex human experience.
*   **You can't control your attraction.** Attraction isn't always a conscious choice.
*   **It’s okay to feel confused.**  It’s okay to not have all the answers right now.

**What You Can Do Now – Important Steps:**

*   **Stop the Behavior:** You've already taken a good first step by recognizing the pattern of looking at the porn.  Try to reduce or eliminate this behavior. It's feeding into your anxiety and isn't helping you understand yourself.
*   **Talk to Someone:** This is crucial. You don't have to go through this alone. Here are some options:
    *   **Therapist:** A therapist specializing in sexuality or anxiety can provide a safe and supportive space to explore your feelings, understand the underlying causes of your anxiety, and develop coping strategies. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be particularly helpful for anxiety.
    *   **Trusted Friend or Family Member:** If you have someone you trust, talking to them can offer emotional support.
    *   **Support Group:**  Connecting with others who are experiencing similar feelings can be incredibly validating.
*   **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself. You're going through a difficult and confusing time. Treat yourself with the same understanding and patience you would offer a friend.
*   **Focus on Self-Care:** Ensure you're getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and engaging in activities that you enjoy.

2700,I blame my past relationship for it. I know it is bad to be this way. I want to get past it.,"We humans are social beings. We learn how to BE in relationship as children. The caregiving you received (or didn't receive) set the stage for how you show up in all your adult relationships. Insecurity in relationships often has much to do with feeling unheard or unseen, perhaps feeling like you don't matter. There are many ways to rewire these relational patterns, the first step of which is taking pause and noticing that you are feeling insecure - so congrats on that because clearly you are already there!  Next I'd suggest finding a relationship therapist to help you sort through your insecurities, either as a couple or individually. ","It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that you're carrying the weight of a past relationship and wanting to move forward. You're absolutely right – dwelling on it and blaming it is a really common, and often incredibly painful, pattern. It’s fantastic that you recognize it’s bad and that you *want* to get past it. That’s a huge first step.

Let's unpack this a little. You've said ""I blame my past relationship for it,"" and “I know it is bad to be this way.” That tells me you're starting to see a connection between the relationship and your current feelings.  Let’s explore that a bit more.

**Here's a breakdown of what we can talk about, and some ways to start moving forward:**

**1. Understanding the 'It':**

* **What specifically are you blaming the relationship for?**  When you say ""it,"" what exactly are you referring to? Are you feeling sad, anxious, insecure, angry, or something else?  Pinpointing the specific emotions is crucial.  For example, are you blaming it for low self-esteem, difficulty trusting, feeling lonely, or a fear of intimacy?
* **What aspects of the relationship are still impacting you?** Was it the betrayal, the conflict, the loss of connection, or something else?  Understanding the root of the pain is key to healing.
* **Is it truly *all* the relationship’s fault?** While relationships undoubtedly shape us, we all have our own vulnerabilities and patterns. Sometimes, the relationship simply brought those things to the surface.

**2. Challenging the Blame:**

* **Is blaming the relationship helpful?**  While it might feel good to focus on what went wrong with someone else, it can keep you stuck.  It can prevent you from taking responsibility for your own healing and growth.
* **Can you reframe it?** Instead of saying ""the relationship *made* me this way,"" could you say, ""The relationship *highlighted* some insecurities I already had, and I’m working on addressing them.""
* **Focus on *your* journey:** You are the author of your own life.  You have the power to change your thoughts and behaviors.

**3. Taking Action – Moving Forward:**

* **Self-Care is Crucial:** When you're hurting, it's easy to neglect yourself.  Focus on things that bring you joy and comfort. This could be anything from taking a bath to spending time in nature to pursuing a hobby.
* **Build a Support System:** Connect with friends and family who offer support and understanding. Talking about your feelings can be incredibly healing.
* **Set Boundaries:** If certain reminders of the relationship trigger painful feelings, it’s okay to limit your exposure to them.
* **Focus on the Present and Future:**  While it’s important to learn from the past, don’t let it define your future.  Set new goals and create a life you love.
* **Consider Therapy:** A therapist can provide a safe and supportive space to explore your feelings, develop coping mechanisms, and work through the trauma of the relationship.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Schema Therapy are often helpful in these situations.

**Important Note:** Healing takes time. There will be good days and bad days. Be patient with yourself and celebrate your progress, no matter how small.

*   **On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being ""not at all"" and 10 being ""completely overwhelmed,"" how would you rate the intensity of these feelings?**",0.5123299956321716
203,"I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.
 I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. While your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard. Talk to them during a non-emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as ""you NEVER listen,"" ""you ALWAYS say..."" and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with ""you"" try using ""I"" by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist, teacher, or school counselor if possible. Most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help.Best of luck to you.","Okay, this is a *lot* to carry, and it sounds incredibly painful. It's incredibly brave of you to articulate all of this, and recognizing the depth of the problem is the first, crucial step. What you're describing is a really common, yet profoundly isolating experience, particularly during the turbulent years of adolescence and early adulthood. Let's break down what you’ve shared and explore some ways to cope.

**Understanding What You’re Feeling**

* **Invalidation is Devastating:** You've hit on a really important point – the feeling of being dismissed or disbelieved is incredibly damaging. It chips away at your sense of self and makes it harder to trust your own judgment. When you’re struggling with depression and anxiety, that feeling of not being heard can be absolutely crippling.
* **The Parental Dynamic:** The fact that your parents don’t seem to believe you, and that they reinforce that disbelief, is a significant issue. It’s understandable that you feel like your childhood has been stolen – a core part of your identity and well-being is being denied.
* **Lack of Support:** It’s heartbreaking to feel like your friends aren't willing to offer the support you need. While it's kind of you to help them, it's important to remember that you deserve to have your own needs met too.
* **Trust Issues:**  You’re right to feel this way.  The cumulative effect of these experiences is building a significant level of distrust, which is a natural response to feeling repeatedly unsupported and invalidated.


**What You Can Do – A Multi-pronged Approach**

1. **Focus on What You *Can* Control:** You can't change your parents' personalities or their beliefs. But you *can* control how you respond to them and who you choose to lean on.

2. **Shift Your Communication:** Since direct communication isn't working, try different approaches:
   * **Grey Rocking:** This technique involves becoming as uninteresting as possible when interacting with someone who is dismissive.  Give brief, factual answers and avoid emotional reactions. It can be frustrating, but it can also prevent you from fueling their negativity.
   * **Focus on Facts:** When discussing serious events, stick to the verifiable facts.  Avoid getting drawn into arguments about your feelings.
   * **Limit Discussion:** Sometimes, the best thing you can do is simply limit your conversations with them about these topics.

3. **Build a Stronger Support System:**
   * **Seek Out Supportive Friends:** You've identified this as important, and it is.  Look for friends who *do* listen, validate your feelings, and offer genuine support.
   * **Explore Therapy:** This is crucial. A therapist can provide a safe space to process your emotions, develop coping mechanisms, and build your self-esteem. They can also help you navigate your relationship with your parents.  Specifically, look for a therapist specializing in family dynamics or trauma.
   * **Support Groups:**  Connecting with others who have experienced similar challenges (particularly those related to depression, anxiety, or family issues) can be incredibly validating and helpful.

4. **Self-Care is Non-Negotiable:**
   * **Prioritize Your Mental Health:** Given your struggles with depression and anxiety, prioritize activities that help you manage your symptoms. This could include exercise, mindfulness, meditation, journaling, or spending time in nature.
   * **Set Boundaries:** Learn to say ""no"" to requests that drain your energy or compromise your well-being.

5. **Reframe Your Expectations:** It’s okay to grieve the childhood you wished you had. It’s also okay to accept that your parents may never fully understand you.  Focus on building a life that *you* find fulfilling, regardless of their opinions.

**Important Note Regarding Your Parents:**

It’s understandable that you're struggling with your parents’ lack of acceptance of your pansexuality. That adds another layer of difficulty to an already challenging situation.  If you feel unsafe or unsupported, consider seeking guidance from an LGBTQ+ support organization.

183,"I think adult life is making him depressed and we often sleep in on weekends untill 1 or 2 pm. We just eat, smoke weed, watch movies, and he'll go on his phone all day. He doesn't seem motivated to do much and he's often angry.
    I have no clue how to help him take his mind off the negative, or to distract him into a different light. How do I help him?",How do you help yourself to believe you require more than what he offers to you?What do you get from this relationship which feels satisfying?To answer this question may in the longterm be the best way to help your bf.,"Okay, this is a really common and challenging situation, and it's great that you're recognizing the issue and wanting to help. It sounds like your friend is struggling, and the behaviors you've described – the lethargy, the substance use, the lack of motivation, and the anger – are often symptoms of depression or a deeper underlying issue. It’s important to approach this with empathy, patience, and realistic expectations. Here's a breakdown of how you can help, focusing on different aspects:

**1. Understanding & Validation (Most Important First Step)**

* **Acknowledge His Feelings:** The most crucial thing you can do is simply acknowledge his feelings. Say things like, ""It sounds like you're going through a really tough time,"" or ""I hear you saying you're feeling really down, and that must be exhausting.""  Don’t try to immediately fix things. Just let him know you see he's struggling.
* **Validate His Experience:**  ""It makes sense that you’d feel this way given what you’re going through."" Avoid minimizing his feelings with phrases like ""Just snap out of it"" or ""Things could be worse.""
* **Listen Without Judgment:**  Give him space to talk about what's bothering him.  Truly listen, without interrupting, offering solutions, or judging his choices.  Sometimes just being heard is enough.

**2. Gently Addressing the Behaviors**

* **Start with ""I"" Statements:** Instead of saying ""You spend all day on your phone,"" try “I’ve noticed you’ve been spending a lot of time on your phone lately, and I’m worried about you. I’m wondering if it’s helping you feel better or if it’s making things harder.”
* **Focus on the Impact:**  ""I'm concerned because I see you're not eating or doing anything that brings you joy, and I want to be here for you.""
* **Don't Lecture:** Lectures rarely work. They often make people defensive.
* **Suggest Small Changes:** Instead of demanding he change everything, suggest small, manageable steps. “Would you be open to going for a short walk with me tomorrow?” or “Maybe we could try cooking a simple meal together?”

**3. Encouraging Healthy Habits (Slowly & Gently)**

* **Suggest Activities (But Don’t Pressure):**  Continue to offer invitations, but respect his refusal.  Start with low-pressure activities he might enjoy – a walk, a coffee, watching a movie (something *besides* always watching movies).
* **Focus on Shared Activities:**  Doing things *with* him can be more appealing than solitary activities.
* **Routine (Gradually):** Help him establish a *slightly* more regular routine. This doesn’t have to be rigid, but consistent sleep and meal times can make a difference.
* **Limit Weed Use (Delicately):** This is a sensitive area. You can express your concern, but avoid telling him he *can’t* use weed.  Try saying, ""I'm worried that the weed might be making it harder to feel better.""

**4. Exploring the Root Causes**

* **Ask Open-Ended Questions:** ""What’s been feeling overwhelming lately?"" ""Is there anything specific that's making you feel this way?""  “When did you start feeling this way?”
* **Recognize Potential Underlying Issues:** Adult life can bring about a lot of stress, financial worries, relationship problems, career dissatisfaction, or grief. He might be struggling with something deeper than just “laziness.”
* **Don't Diagnose:** You are a friend, not a therapist.

**5. Encouraging Professional Help**

* **Normalize Seeking Help:** ""It’s okay to not be okay, and there are people who can help. Talking to a therapist can be a really positive step.""
* **Offer to Help Find Resources:** Research therapists or support groups in your area. Offer to make the first phone call with him if he’s hesitant.
* **Suggest Online Resources:** There are many reputable online therapy options and mental health resources available.

**Important Considerations & What *Not* To Do:**

* **Don’t Enable:** Avoid constantly bailing him out or covering for him.
* **Don’t Take on His Problems:** You can’t fix him. Your role is to support him.
* **Set Boundaries:** Protect your own mental health. It’s okay to say, “I’m here for you, but I need to take care of myself too.”
* **Don’t Argue When He’s Angry:** If he’s expressing anger, try to de-escalate the situation.  Say something like, ""I can see you're really frustrated. Let's take a break and talk about this later when we're both calmer.”

33,"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",There is no such thing as too many issues for counseling. Many issues are often interrelated and can all be worked on with some time and patience.,"Okay, let's tackle this. It’s incredibly brave of you to acknowledge all you're carrying and to reach out with this question. The short answer is: **no, you absolutely do not have too many issues to address in counseling.** In fact, the combination of experiences you've described is *precisely* why seeking professional support is so important.

Let's break down why your situation is complex and why counseling is a really good idea:

**1. The Weight of Your History:**

* **Sexual Abuse:** This is a foundational issue. Trauma from sexual abuse often has profound and long-lasting effects on mental health, impacting self-esteem, relationships, anxiety, depression, and how you relate to intimacy. It's not just a ""past event""; it shapes how you experience the world.
* **Breast Cancer Survivor:**  Cancer is a huge life event, and surviving it can bring about significant emotional shifts.  It’s not just the physical experience; it’s the fear, the uncertainty, the changes in your body, and the potential impact on your future.  It can trigger or exacerbate existing mental health conditions.
* **Chronic Insomnia:**  Insomnia itself can contribute to depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. It disrupts sleep patterns, impacting mood, cognitive function, and overall well-being.
* **Long-Standing Depression & Anxiety:** These are common comorbidities (conditions that frequently occur together) in individuals with a history of trauma. They can be interconnected and reinforce each other.
* **Low Self-Esteem:** Often a consequence of trauma and negative self-perception developed through past experiences.

**2. Why Counseling is Crucial:**

* **Processing Trauma:**  A therapist specializing in trauma (like a therapist trained in EMDR, CBT-Trauma Focused, or Somatic Experiencing) can help you safely process the memories and emotions associated with the abuse. This doesn't mean reliving the trauma, but rather understanding it, changing your relationship to it, and reducing its impact.
* **Developing Coping Mechanisms:** You'll learn strategies for managing anxiety, depression, and insomnia.
* **Building Self-Esteem:** Counseling can help you challenge negative self-talk and develop a more positive and realistic view of yourself.
* **Addressing Co-occurring Conditions:** A therapist can help you address the interconnectedness of your insomnia, depression, and anxiety.
* **Strengthening Your Marriage:** While your marriage is a wonderful thing, it's important to have the tools to navigate challenges and maintain a healthy connection, especially given your personal struggles.

**3. Addressing Your Concern – ""Too Many Issues?""**

It's understandable to feel overwhelmed. It *does* sound like a lot. However, a skilled therapist will:

* **Prioritize:** They’ll work with you to identify the areas that are most impacting your life *right now*.
* **Integrate:** They’ll help you see how all these issues are connected.
* **Take it One Step at a Time:** Progress in therapy is often gradual. You’ll likely start with smaller goals and build from there.

**4. Finding the Right Therapist:**

* **Look for a Trauma-Informed Therapist:**  This is *essential* given your history of abuse.
* **Consider Specializations:** Some therapists specialize in cancer survivorship, insomnia, or couples therapy.
* **Don’t Be Afraid to Interview Therapists:**  It’s crucial to find someone you feel comfortable with and trust.

3000,My fiancé and I broke up. He cheated on me numerous times. I kept forgiving but questioning his every move. He got tired and left.,if he as cheated on you multiple times it is not healthy for you to continue seeing him.  However It takes time to heal your pain. You are not a robot that can just switch off your emotions.  Please surround yourself with people who can support and empower you. ,"Okay, this sounds incredibly painful and understandably confusing. You've been through a really difficult and emotionally draining experience, and it's completely valid to feel a whole range of emotions – hurt, anger, confusion, sadness, and probably a lot of self-doubt. Let's unpack this and talk about how you're likely feeling and what you can do now.

**It's Okay to Feel This Way:**

* **You're Valid:** Your feelings are completely justified. Being cheated on repeatedly is devastating. It’s not your fault that he cheated, and it's not your fault that you struggled to trust him. Trust is earned, and he failed to earn yours.
* **The Cycle Was Exhausting:** You described a cycle of forgiveness and questioning, and that's incredibly draining.  Constantly having to prove yourself and validate his actions takes a massive toll on your mental and emotional well-being.  It’s not a sustainable or healthy way to be in a relationship.
* **He Left Because of *His* Actions:** His leaving wasn't about you questioning him; it was about him being unable to handle the situation he created.  It’s a huge reflection of his character and his willingness to take responsibility for his behavior.

**Understanding Your Feelings:**

Let's talk about some of the specific emotions you might be grappling with:

* **Betrayal:** This is a core feeling.  Betrayal cuts deep and can make it hard to trust anyone in the future.
* **Self-Doubt:** It’s common to question yourself – ""Did I do something wrong? Was I not enough?""  Remind yourself that his behavior was about *him*, not about your worth.
* **Anger:** It's okay to be angry – at him, at yourself, at the situation.  Anger can be a healthy response to injustice.
* **Sadness/Grief:** You're grieving the loss of the relationship you hoped for and the future you envisioned.
* **Confusion:** You might be questioning why he cheated, why you kept forgiving, and what you could have done differently.  It's okay to not have all the answers.

**What You Can Do Now:**

1. **Allow Yourself to Feel:** Don’t try to suppress your emotions.  Cry, scream (into a pillow!), write in a journal, talk to a trusted friend or family member – whatever helps you process what you’re going through.

2. **Focus on Self-Care:** This is *crucial*.  You deserve to prioritize your well-being.
   * **Physical Health:** Eat healthy, get enough sleep, and exercise.
   * **Mental Health:** Consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide a safe space to process your emotions, develop coping strategies, and build your self-esteem.
   * **Do Things You Enjoy:** Reconnect with hobbies, spend time with people who make you happy, and engage in activities that bring you joy.

3. **No Contact:** This is incredibly important for your healing.  Cut off all contact with him – no calls, texts, social media stalking, or attempts to reason with him.  This gives you the space you need to heal and move on.

4. **Challenge Negative Thoughts:**  He may have planted seeds of doubt in your mind. Actively challenge those thoughts. Remind yourself of his behavior, his lack of respect, and that you deserve someone who treats you with love and honesty.

5. **Learn from the Experience:**  Once you've had some time to heal, you can reflect on the relationship and what you've learned.  This isn’t about blaming yourself; it’s about understanding what you want and need in a future relationship.

6. **Build Your Support System:** Lean on your friends and family.  Surround yourself with people who love and support you.

358,"I have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.","Something to remember about anxiety is that it's a useful and necessary response to stressors, and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming. Anxiety is our brain's way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action. Some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. The first I'd recommend is a calm breathing technique - breathe in for 4-5 seconds, and then out for 7-8 seconds. Try to repeat this for 3-5 minutes. Another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe - without judging - the sensations to yourself. Try to be very specific, such as ""my palms are feeling very sweaty, and I can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies."" Then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad - just experiencing them as intentionally as possible.  Combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful. If you feel that these techniques don't help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to, then I'd highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional. This professional can help you determine if therapy/counseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms.","Okay, it’s incredibly brave of you to acknowledge and talk about these anxieties. It sounds like you’re carrying a lot, and it’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed by the pressures of modern life – finances, work, relationships, kids, and home management are *huge* stressors. Let's break this down and explore some ways to cope. 

**1. Understanding Your Anxiety:**

* **Normal Reaction:** First, let's normalize this. Anxiety about these things is *extremely* common. The constant demands of life can trigger a very real, often disproportionate, response in our brains.
* **Identify Specific Triggers:** You’ve listed broad categories, which is a good start. Let's get more specific. For each area (finances, work, relationships, kids, household), what *specifically* is causing you the most anxiety?  Examples:
    * **Finances:**  ""I worry about unexpected bills,"" ""I'm stressed about saving for retirement,"" ""I feel guilty about spending money.""
    * **Work:** “I fear job loss,” “I’m anxious about deadlines,” “I worry about my performance.”
    * **Relationships:** “I worry about conflict with my partner,” “I feel insecure in my relationships,” “I fear losing loved ones.”
    * **Kids:** “I worry about their safety,” “I feel overwhelmed by their needs,” “I fear failing as a parent.”
    * **Household:** “I feel like I’m constantly behind on chores,” “I worry about maintaining a clean and organized home,” ""I feel like I'm not doing enough.""
* **Recognize Your Anxiety Patterns:**  How do you *feel* when you experience these anxieties? What physical sensations do you notice (racing heart, shortness of breath, muscle tension)? What thoughts go through your head?  Understanding your patterns can help you anticipate and manage them.

**2. Coping Strategies – Immediate Relief:**

* **Grounding Techniques:** When anxiety hits, these can bring you back to the present moment:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Name 5 things you see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you hear, 2 things you smell, and 1 thing you taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:** Box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4) is particularly effective.
    * **Sensory Focus:** Hold an ice cube, listen to calming music, or take a warm bath.
* **Short, Focused Relaxation:**  Even 5-10 minutes of meditation or gentle stretching can make a difference. There are tons of free guided meditations on YouTube and apps like Headspace and Calm.
* **Self-Compassion:**  Be kind to yourself.  Anxiety doesn’t make you a bad person.  Acknowledge your feelings without judgment.  Say something like, ""It's okay to feel anxious. This is a lot to handle.""

**3. Longer-Term Strategies – Building Resilience:**

* **Challenge Negative Thoughts:** Anxiety often feeds on negative thought patterns. Learn to identify and challenge them. Are your thoughts realistic? Are you catastrophizing (imagining the worst-case scenario)?  Ask yourself, ""What's the evidence for this thought? What's a more balanced perspective?""
* **Time Management & Prioritization:** Feeling overwhelmed often stems from too much on your plate.
    * **Make a List:** Write down *everything* you feel you need to do.
    * **Prioritize:** Use a method like the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important) to focus on what truly matters.
    * **Delegate:** Can you ask for help with chores, childcare, or other tasks?
    * **Learn to Say No:** Protect your time and energy.
* **Healthy Lifestyle:** This is crucial!
    * **Regular Exercise:** Even a short walk can reduce anxiety.
    * **Balanced Diet:** Avoid excessive caffeine and sugar.
    * **Sufficient Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep.
* **Build a Support System:**  Talk to someone you trust – a friend, family member, or therapist.  Sharing your feelings can be incredibly helpful.

**4. Seeking Professional Help:**

* **Therapy:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is particularly effective for anxiety. It can teach you coping skills and help you change negative thought patterns.
* **Medication:**  In some cases, medication may be helpful, but it’s usually best to explore therapy first.  Talk to your doctor about your options.

432,"I am a really shy person. I'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?","I can offer you hypnosis for confidence in presentations, via Skype, if you're in Cali.","Okay, this is a really common and incredibly understandable struggle, especially in a demanding environment like a graduate program. It's fantastic that you're recognizing this and actively seeking solutions – that's a huge first step! Let's break down how you can build confidence, specifically around presentations. Here's a multi-faceted approach, combining practical techniques with addressing the underlying shyness:

**1. Understanding Your Shyness (The Foundation)**

* **Identify Your Triggers:** What *specifically* makes you feel stressed? Is it the size of the audience? The fear of messing up? The feeling of being judged? Being able to pinpoint the exact source of your anxiety will help you target your strategies.
* **Recognize It's Okay to Be Shy:**  Shyness isn't a flaw. It’s a personality trait.  Many successful people are introverted and thrive on thoughtful communication. Accepting that you're shy allows you to approach it with self-compassion rather than self-criticism.
* **Challenge Negative Thoughts:** Shyness often fuels negative thoughts like ""I’m going to look stupid,"" ""Everyone will think I’m boring,"" or ""I’ll forget everything.""  When you notice these thoughts, consciously challenge them. Ask yourself: ""Is there evidence to support this thought? What's the *most likely* outcome?""  Replace them with more realistic and positive ones like, ""I've prepared, and I can do my best.""

**2. Preparation - Your Secret Weapon**

* **Practice, Practice, Practice:** This is *crucial*. Don’t just read through your slides. Rehearse *out loud*, as if you're giving the presentation. Start in private, then move to friends, family, or even a mirror.
* **Record Yourself:**  This is tough, but incredibly effective. Watching yourself can reveal nervous habits (fidgeting, saying ""um"" too much) and areas where you can improve.
* **Start Small:** Don’t jump straight into presenting to a large group. Begin with smaller, more comfortable settings – maybe presenting to a study group or a one-on-one with your advisor.
* **Know Your Material Inside and Out:** The more comfortable you are with the content, the less you’ll worry about forgetting things.
* **Prepare for Questions:** Anticipate potential questions and have answers prepared. It's okay to say, ""That's a great question, let me think about that for a moment.""

**3. Techniques for Managing Anxiety During the Presentation**

* **Breathing Exercises:**  Deep, slow breathing can calm your nervous system. Try the 4-7-8 technique: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds.
* **Grounding Techniques:** If you feel overwhelmed, focus on your senses. What do you see? What do you hear? What do you feel (your feet on the ground)? This brings you back to the present moment.
* **Positive Self-Talk:** Remind yourself of your strengths and accomplishments.
* **Start with a Strong Opening:** Having a well-prepared and confident opening can build momentum and reduce anxiety.
* **Focus on Your Message, Not Yourself:** Shift your attention from your nervousness to the value you're providing to the audience.

**4. Gradual Exposure & Building Confidence**

* **Celebrate Small Wins:** Acknowledge and appreciate every successful presentation, no matter how small.
* **Seek Feedback (Carefully):** Ask a trusted friend or mentor for constructive feedback. Frame the request positively – ""I'm working on improving my presentation skills, could you give me some feedback on my clarity and delivery?""
* **Join a Public Speaking Group (Toastmasters is great):** This provides a supportive environment to practice and receive feedback.
* **Visualization:**  Before a presentation, vividly imagine yourself giving a successful presentation – feeling confident, engaging the audience, and delivering your message effectively.

**5.  Addressing the Root of the Shyness (Longer-Term)**

* **Consider Therapy:** If your shyness is significantly impacting your life, talking to a therapist can provide you with tools and strategies to address the underlying causes. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is often very effective for anxiety.
* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself.  It’s a process, and there will be setbacks. Don’t beat yourself up if you stumble – learn from it and keep going.

1457,What makes a healthy marriage last?,"Thank you for your question.  A good Marriage is one that takes hard work and commitment.  Being in a good marriage does not always mean good times because let's face it; we are dealing with 2 unique individuals with differences.  A good spouse or partner knows to be patient and accepting.  Knowing each other's strengths and imperfections and working with them to lift each other is how you strengthen your love for one another.  A good spouse sacrifices their needs to see the other person happy.  Don't get me wrong, that also means that it is important to have alone time to re-charge and re-focus our purpose in the marriage.  In all, there is not a magic recipe for a successful marriage, but with time, work and purpose one can have a happy one.","Okay, let's tackle this big question! There's no single magic formula, but research and countless couples who've made it through decades point to several key ingredients for a lasting marriage. Here's a breakdown, grouped into categories:

**1. Communication - The Foundation**

* **Open and Honest Communication:** This isn’t just about talking *about* things. It’s about feeling safe enough to share your hopes, fears, dreams, frustrations, and vulnerabilities with your partner.
* **Active Listening:** Truly *hearing* what your partner is saying, trying to understand their perspective, even if you don't agree. This means putting down your phone, making eye contact, and reflecting back what you heard.
* **""I"" Statements:**  Instead of blaming (""You always...""), use ""I"" statements to express your feelings (""I feel hurt when..."").
* **Regular Check-Ins:**  Don’t wait for problems to explode. Schedule regular times (even 15-30 minutes a week) to talk about how you’re both feeling about the relationship.
* **Conflict Resolution Skills:**  Disagreements are inevitable. It's *how* you handle them that matters. This includes compromise, empathy, and avoiding personal attacks.



**2. Connection & Intimacy**

* **Emotional Intimacy:**  Feeling deeply understood and accepted by your partner.  This is about vulnerability and sharing your inner world.
* **Physical Intimacy:**  This goes beyond just sex. It includes affection, touch, cuddling, holding hands – all ways to physically connect and express love.  It’s important to discuss and meet each other’s needs here.
* **Shared Activities & Interests:** Having things you enjoy doing together strengthens your bond.  It doesn't have to be grand adventures; it could be cooking, watching movies, or pursuing a hobby.
* **Quality Time:**  Dedicated, focused time together, free from distractions.
* **Rituals & Traditions:** Establishing routines and traditions (anniversary dinners, weekend hikes, etc.) creates a sense of continuity and connection.

**3. Respect & Trust**

* **Mutual Respect:** Valuing your partner's opinions, feelings, and boundaries, even when you disagree.  This includes respecting their time, space, and individuality.
* **Trust:** This is the bedrock. It’s believing in your partner’s loyalty, honesty, and commitment.  It’s built through consistent behavior and open communication.
* **Appreciation & Gratitude:** Regularly expressing gratitude for your partner and the things they do – big or small.  Don't take them for granted.
* **Support:**  Being there for your partner through good times and bad.  Celebrating their successes and offering support during challenges.

**4. Personal Growth & Commitment**

* **Individual Growth:** Recognizing that you and your partner will evolve over time.  Supporting each other’s personal growth and aspirations.
* **Commitment:** A conscious decision to work on the relationship, even when it’s hard.  A willingness to invest time, energy, and effort.
* **Forgiveness:**  Holding onto grudges can poison a relationship. Learning to forgive and move on.
* **Adaptability:** Life throws curveballs. Being able to adapt to changes and challenges together.
* **Humor:** Sharing laughter and having a sense of fun can ease tension and strengthen your bond.



**5. External Factors & Seeking Help**

* **Realistic Expectations:**  Marriage isn’t a fairytale.  Accept that there will be challenges and imperfections.
* **Financial Stability:**  Money problems are a major source of stress in relationships.  Open communication and shared financial goals are crucial.
* **Social Support:**  Having a strong support network of friends and family can provide valuable assistance and perspective.
* **Seeking Professional Help:**  Don’t wait until things are dire.  Couples therapy can provide valuable tools and guidance for communication, conflict resolution, and strengthening your relationship.

**Important Note:**  There's no ""one size fits all."" Every couple is unique. The key is to identify what's important to *you* and *your partner* and to consistently work on building a strong, loving, and fulfilling relationship.

2671,"He isn't violent, but he has anger issues and deep insecurities. He's working on them and has improved. We started counseling, and he participated in one or two individual sessions, but we broke up again shortly thereafter. Now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining.","From what you write, you're not too happy with how your boyfriend treats you and how he handles his own life.What keeps you feeling connected to him in positive ways?If you're truly not happy most of the time in this relationship, then you're at the time of asking why you'd want to remain in a relationship which is draining.","Okay, this sounds incredibly frustrating and emotionally taxing. It's completely understandable that you're feeling drained by his constant questions and accusations, especially given the previous issues you've described. Let's break this down and explore what might be happening and what you can do.

**Understanding the Situation:**

* **The Root Causes:** You've rightly identified the core issues: anger issues and deep insecurities. These aren't just surface-level problems; they’re likely driving a lot of his behavior. Insecurities can manifest as defensiveness, need for reassurance, and a tendency to perceive threats, which then fuel anger.
* **The Counseling Attempt:** The fact that he participated in a couple of sessions and then the relationship ended suggests a complex dynamic. It could mean:
    * **He wasn’t truly ready for the work:**  Addressing deep-seated issues requires significant commitment and willingness to confront uncomfortable truths.  A couple of sessions might not have been enough to genuinely shift his perspective.
    * **The counseling wasn’t a good fit:** Sometimes, a therapist’s approach simply doesn’t resonate with a person’s personality or needs.
    * **He wasn’t fully engaging:** Even if he attended sessions, he might not have been truly open or honest with the therapist.
* **The Pattern of Behavior:** The ""constant questions and accusations"" are a significant red flag. This isn't just about insecurity; it's potentially a pattern of control, distrust, and a need to exert power, even if unconsciously.

**What You're Feeling is Valid:**

It's *completely* valid to feel drained.  Being constantly questioned and accused is exhausting, especially when it stems from unresolved issues. It’s a form of emotional abuse, even if unintentional.  You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel safe, respected, and not constantly scrutinized.

**What You Can Do – Prioritizing Your Well-being:**

1. **Establish Clear Boundaries:** This is absolutely crucial. You need to clearly and firmly communicate what you will and will not tolerate. Examples:
   * ""I understand you're struggling with insecurity, but I won't respond to accusations. If you feel the need to question my motives, I will end the conversation.""
   * ""I'm happy to talk about your feelings, but I need you to express them without blaming or attacking me.""
   * ""I need you to trust me.  I'm not going to constantly defend myself against unfounded concerns.""

2. **Enforce Those Boundaries:** This is the hardest part. You *must* follow through. If he starts questioning or accusing, calmly state your boundary and then disengage.  Don't get drawn into arguments or justifications.  Walk away.

3. **Limited Contact (or No Contact):**  Given the pattern of behavior, you may need to significantly reduce or eliminate contact. Constant contact will only allow the behavior to continue and drain you further.

4. **Don’t Try to Fix Him:** You can’t fix his issues. He needs to take responsibility for his own behavior and seek ongoing support – perhaps through individual therapy.  Trying to manage his emotions for him will be incredibly frustrating and likely ineffective.

5. **Focus on Your Own Healing:** This situation is understandably upsetting.  Prioritize self-care – activities that bring you joy, relaxation, and support. Lean on friends and family.

6. **Re-evaluate Counseling:** If he’s open to it, suggest he continue individual therapy. However, make it clear that you will not be involved in managing his emotions or engaging in arguments.

**Important Note:** If his behavior escalates, becomes threatening, or you feel unsafe, prioritize your safety and seek help immediately.  Don’t hesitate to reach out to a domestic violence hotline or support organization.

3025,"Sometime when small thing happen, like losing a comb, I get furious.  I even start throwing things. Do I have a problem?","I don't like the word ""problem"".  It is such a strong word.  However I would say that you have an issue that needs to be addressed and controlled before it directed at the wrong person and gets totally out of control.  I have found that anger management classes has been helpful for my clients.  Try and see if it will help.  You will be surprised at what you learn about your self.","It's really good of you to recognize that this is happening and to reach out and ask about it. The fact that you're questioning it and feeling concerned is a really positive step. Let's address this – you absolutely don't *necessarily* have a problem, but what you're experiencing is definitely something worth understanding and addressing. Here's a breakdown of what might be happening and what you can do:

**1. Understanding the Behavior:**

* **Emotional Regulation Difficulties:** Losing a small item like a comb can trigger a disproportionate emotional response – anger, frustration, and even the urge to throw things. This often points to difficulty regulating intense emotions. It doesn’t automatically mean a mental health condition, but it's a common thread.
* **Frustration & Loss of Control:** Losing something you value (even something small) can feel like a loss of control. It can trigger feelings of helplessness and a desire to regain a sense of power, which might manifest in impulsive behavior.
* **Stress and Anxiety:** Sometimes, these reactions are a symptom of underlying stress or anxiety. The small loss can be a trigger for broader feelings of unease.
* **Impulse Control:**  The throwing of items can be a sign of poor impulse control. It's a way to release pent-up energy or frustration.
* **Neurodivergence:** If you have ADHD, Autism, or another neurodivergence, emotional regulation can be particularly challenging. You might experience intense emotions more intensely and have different strategies for coping.

**2. Is This a Problem?**

* **Frequency:** How often does this happen? Is it a regular occurrence, or is it rare?
* **Impact:** Does this behavior significantly disrupt your life, relationships, or daily functioning? Do you feel genuinely ashamed or embarrassed afterward?
* **Harm:** Are you or others getting hurt as a result of your actions? (This is crucial – throwing things can be dangerous).
* **Your Feelings:** How do *you* feel about it? Do you feel like it's out of control and distressing?

**3. What You Can Do – Steps to Take:**

* **Recognize and Acknowledge:** You've already done this – excellent! Just being aware is the first step.
* **Take a Break:** When you feel the anger rising, *immediately* step away from the situation. Go to another room, take deep breaths, or do something calming.
* **Grounding Techniques:** These can help you reconnect with the present moment and calm your nervous system:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Name 5 things you see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4) is a great one.
* **Identify Triggers:**  Start paying attention to *what* is happening just before you feel this anger. Is it a specific situation, thought, or feeling?
* **Healthy Coping Mechanisms:** Find alternative ways to deal with frustration:
    * Exercise
    * Talking to a trusted friend or family member
    * Hobbies you enjoy
    * Writing in a journal
* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself.  It’s okay to have strong emotions. Don’t beat yourself up about it.

**4. When to Seek Professional Help:**

* **If the behavior is frequent and disruptive.**
* **If you're struggling to manage your emotions on your own.**
* **If you're concerned about hurting yourself or others.**
* **If you suspect an underlying mental health condition (like anxiety or depression).**

976,I recently lost a friend to suicide. I'm smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it. How can I handle this better?,"Suicide is a very traumatic loss and affects survivors significantly. Everyone deals with their grief in different ways. One way I recommend to deal with the loss of a loved one is to write letters to them. Some people like to keep the letters in a jar, maybe fill the jar with sand so the letters are buried. I recommend writing the letters as often as you need to. You will notice over time the need to write the letters will decrease and the intense feelings of loss will decrease. I also recommend finding a survivors support group in your area. You can find more information on www.afsp.org.","Okay, let's talk about this. What you're going through is incredibly difficult, and it’s brave of you to reach out. Losing a friend to suicide is a profoundly painful experience, and it's completely understandable that you're struggling to cope with feelings of grief, sadness, and perhaps guilt or confusion. It’s also really important to acknowledge that you’re turning to marijuana and alcohol as ways to numb the pain – this is a common reaction when dealing with intense grief, but it can unfortunately make things worse in the long run.

**Here's a breakdown of how to handle this, focusing on immediate support and a path toward healthier coping strategies:**

**1. Prioritize Your Safety – This is the Most Important Step:**

* **Recognize the Connection:** You've already taken a crucial step by acknowledging that your coping mechanisms (marijuana and alcohol) might be contributing to the problem.  They're likely offering temporary relief, but they aren’t addressing the root of your pain and can actually intensify negative feelings over time.
* **Don’t Isolate:**  Please, don’t withdraw from everyone. Isolation will only make things harder.
* **If you're having thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out immediately.** Here are resources that are available 24/7:
    * **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Dial 988
    * **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741
    * **The Trevor Project:** 1-866-488-7386 (for LGBTQ youth)

**2. Processing Your Grief – It’s a Long Process:**

* **Allow Yourself to Feel:** Don’t try to suppress your emotions. Grief is complex and messy. Allow yourself to cry, to feel angry, sad, confused – whatever comes up.  Trying to bottle it up will only make it more intense.
* **Talk About It:** Find someone you trust – a family member, another friend, a therapist – and talk about your friend, your memories, your feelings.  Just voicing these things can be incredibly helpful.
* **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a powerful way to process them.
* **Memorialize Your Friend:**  Creating a small memorial, sharing stories about your friend, or doing something in their memory can be a way to honor their life and keep their spirit alive.

**3. Addressing Your Substance Use:**

* **Understand the Connection:** Recognize that you’re likely using substances to avoid dealing with the pain.  This isn’t about willpower; it’s about addressing the underlying issue.
* **Talk to a Professional:** This is absolutely critical. A therapist or counselor can help you understand why you’re turning to substances and develop healthier coping strategies. They can also assess whether you need support for substance use.
* **Consider Support Groups:**  Groups like SMART Recovery or NA (Narcotics Anonymous) can provide support and accountability.
* **Start Small:** If you decide to reduce your substance use, do it gradually and with support.

**4. Seeking Professional Support:**

* **Therapy is Key:**  A therapist specializing in grief, loss, or substance use disorders can provide invaluable support. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) are often helpful approaches.
* **Find a Therapist:** Here are some resources:

    * **Open Path Collective:** [https://openpathcollective.org/](https://openpathcollective.org/) (offers affordable therapy options)

**5.  Self-Care – Focus on What Nourishes You:**

* **Healthy Habits:**  While it’s okay to not be “productive,” prioritize basic self-care:
    * **Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep.
    * **Nutrition:** Eat regular, healthy meals.
    * **Exercise:** Even a short walk can make a difference.
    * **Relaxation Techniques:**  Meditation, deep breathing, yoga.
* **Engage in Activities You Enjoy (When You Can):**  Even small things can bring a little joy.

**Important Reminders:**

* **You Are Not Responsible:**  Your friend’s suicide was not your fault.  Don’t blame yourself.
* **Grief Takes Time:** There’s no set timeline for grieving.  Be patient with yourself.
* **Celebrate Their Life:**  Focus on the good memories and the positive impact your friend had on your life.

2871,"Maybe this is a stupid question, but I sometimes don't know what's real or not. If feel at times like everyone's lying. How do I know if God is one of those lies?","  It is not a stupid question, it is very basic. To help answer your question, let me begin with the premise that you will never have absolute proof. With that being said, one can look at different phenomena in nature and history and figure what is the statistical probability that they happened randomly. If one comes to the logical conclusion that many are quite improbable, then there must be a guiding force and plan.  May you be successful in your journey.","Okay, this is a *really* important and incredibly common question, and it's absolutely okay to feel this way. It takes a lot of courage to admit you're questioning fundamental beliefs, so you're already taking a huge step. Let's unpack this. It’s fantastic that you're wrestling with these doubts – it’s a sign of a healthy, thoughtful mind.

**First, Let's Normalize the Feeling:**

* **Doubt is Normal:** Seriously. Almost everyone, at some point in their life, experiences times of profound doubt. It's a natural part of being human. We're wired to question, to seek understanding, and to grapple with the big questions of existence.  Think about it – the very act of asking this question shows you're not passively accepting everything you're told.
* **Feeling Like Everyone is Lying:** This feeling of pervasive distrust is often rooted in a few things:
    * **Information Overload:** We’re bombarded with information, much of it conflicting or designed to mislead.
    * **Social Conditioning:** We learn from others, and sometimes those messages are flawed or based on manipulation.
    * **Personal Trauma:** Past experiences can deeply affect our ability to trust.

**Now, Let's Tackle the Question of God:**

You're asking a profoundly difficult question: ""If everyone might be lying, can I trust God?"" Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, acknowledging that there are no easy answers:

1. **Recognize the Nature of Faith:** Faith isn’t about absolute proof. It’s about a *belief* – a conviction – in the face of uncertainty.  It's built on experience, reflection, and a willingness to embrace mystery.  Faith doesn't demand logical certainty; it asks for a leap of trust.

2. **Different Conceptions of God:** The idea of ""God"" is incredibly diverse.  
   * **Traditional God:** The God of Abrahamic religions – omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent. This God is often seen as the source of morality and the ultimate judge.
   * **Pantheistic God:** God *is* the universe – a force of nature, a principle of existence.
   * **Personal God:** A God who is a loving companion, involved in individual lives.

3. **Addressing the ""Everyone is Lying"" Feeling in Relation to God:** If you feel like everyone is lying, it’s understandable to extend that suspicion to religious claims.  Here’s how to respond:

   * **Scrutinize Claims:**  Critical thinking is *essential*.  Don't blindly accept anything.  Ask questions:
      * **What is the evidence for this claim?** (Be wary of anecdotes alone).
      * **Is this claim consistent with other evidence?**
      * **Who benefits from this belief, and how?** (Consider motives).
   * **Explore Your Own Experiences:**  You mentioned feeling like everyone is lying.  Can you connect that feeling to your relationship with faith?  Have there been times when religious teachings haven't seemed to align with your experience of the world or your own moral compass?
   * **The Problem of Evil:**  A common argument against the existence of a benevolent, all-powerful God is the problem of suffering.  If God is all-good and all-powerful, why does suffering exist?  This is a complex philosophical and theological challenge.

4. **It's Okay to Question, and to Shift Beliefs:**  It’s perfectly valid to question your faith and even to change your beliefs.  Many people have wrestled with this throughout their lives.  The important thing is to do so with honesty and integrity. You don't have to force yourself to believe something you don't genuinely feel is true.

**Here are some things you can do:**

* **Talk to Someone:**  Find a trusted friend, family member, therapist, or spiritual advisor who can listen to your doubts without judgment.
* **Read Widely:**  Explore different religious and philosophical perspectives.
* **Engage in Prayer or Meditation:** Even if you're doubting, these practices can help you connect with something larger than yourself.
* **Focus on Values:** Even if you don't believe in a specific deity, you can still hold onto your core values – compassion, kindness, justice, etc.

**Important Note:** This isn't about finding a definitive ""proof"" of God or disproving God. It's about navigating a complex and deeply personal journey of questioning and belief.

564,"I feel that I need to end my present relationship. He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.","It sounds like you have some insight into the cycle that you describe with your current relationship and at the same time you are still feeling stuck. It also sounds like the distressing feelings that you experience, when you imagine what will happen for you and your current partner, are pretty overwhelming. A competent therapist may be able to help you work through these difficult thoughts and feelings and find a resolution to this cycle that will feel right to you.","Okay, this is a really complex and understandably painful situation. It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional burden, and it’s incredibly brave of you to acknowledge the patterns and the impact they’re having on you. Let’s break this down and explore some ways to approach this.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **You’ve Identified the Core Issue:** You've correctly pinpointed the core problem – the lack of presence and consistent effort from your partner, combined with his need for reassurance. This isn’t a fundamental incompatibility in terms of *what* you want in a relationship, but rather a mismatch in *how* you need to experience it.
* **The Cycle is Powerful:** You're right to recognize that you’ve gone through this cycle before. These cycles are incredibly difficult to break because they feed into each other. The anxiety and depression *reinforce* the patterns of reassurance-seeking and reconciliation. It’s like a self-fulfilling prophecy.
* **Your Anxiety is a Significant Driver:** Your panic and fear are a huge factor. It's completely understandable that you're afraid of being alone and of not finding someone you like, but these fears aren't helping you move forward. They’re actually trapping you.
* **Seven Years is a Significant Investment:** You've invested a considerable amount of time and emotion into this relationship, which understandably makes the thought of ending it incredibly difficult.

**Let’s Address the Anxiety and Depression**

This is the key. Your anxiety and depression are not the problem *per se*, but they are the *mechanism* that keeps you stuck. Here’s how to approach them:

1. **Recognize It’s Okay to Feel This Way:**  Don’t beat yourself up for feeling anxious and depressed. It’s a natural response to a significant life change and a potentially painful separation. Acknowledge the feelings without judgment.
2. **Challenge Your Thoughts:** When you have a thought like ""He'll be with someone else"" or ""I'll never meet someone I like,"" actively challenge it. Ask yourself:
    * ""Is this thought based on evidence, or just fear?""
    * ""What's the worst-case scenario, and how likely is it to actually happen?""
    * ""What's a more realistic and balanced thought?"" (e.g., ""He's busy right now, but that doesn't mean he doesn't care about me,"" or ""I’m capable of building a fulfilling life, regardless of my relationship status."")
3. **Grounding Techniques:** When anxiety spikes, use grounding techniques to bring you back to the present moment. These could include:
    * Deep breathing exercises
    * Focusing on your senses (What do you see, hear, smell, taste, touch?)
    *  A quick mindfulness meditation
4. **Talk to Someone:** Seriously consider talking to a therapist. They can provide you with tools and strategies to manage your anxiety and depression, and help you process your emotions in a healthy way. CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) is often very effective for challenging negative thought patterns.

**Moving Forward with the Relationship (or Not)**

* **Communicate Clearly (Again):** You've already told him how you feel, which is good. However, he needs to *understand* the impact his actions are having on *you*. Explain that the distance and lack of consistent effort are fueling your anxiety and that you need a different level of connection.
* **Set Boundaries:** This is crucial. You need to establish clear boundaries about communication frequency, visits, and expectations. It’s okay to say, ""I need to see you once a month to maintain a connection."" Don't negotiate beyond this.
* **Consider a Trial Separation:** If you're struggling to establish new boundaries and manage your anxiety, a short, structured trial separation might be a helpful way to gain clarity and perspective.
* **Accept That You Can't Change Him:** You can’t force him to be more present or prioritize the relationship. You can only control your own actions and reactions.

**Important Note:** Ending a 7-year relationship is incredibly difficult. Be patient with yourself. There will be good days and bad days. Celebrate the small victories and don’t get discouraged by setbacks.

812,How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,"That's a loaded question.  Typically, if we are contemplating if we should or not, it is for a reason.  To really come to a place of decision, you need to know where you are right now, what is not working, what the potential resolution would be and if it is realistic.  If you can answer those questions, you may gain some insight.   If it is realistic and your boyfriend is on the same page, seek help putting a plan in motion for resolution.  And I mention him being on the same page because if he is not, then it will never come to fruiting.  Without much other information, this is this is a solid approach.","Okay, this is a really tough question, and it’s great that you’re taking the time to think about it seriously. Deciding whether to end a relationship is a huge decision, and there's no easy answer. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach this, broken down into steps and considerations:

**1. Self-Reflection - Understanding Your Feelings:**

* **Identify the Core Issues:** What’s *really* bothering you? Don't just say ""I'm unhappy."" Dig deeper. Is it:
    * **Lack of Connection:** Do you feel emotionally distant, like you don’t truly understand each other?
    * **Communication Problems:** Do you argue constantly, feel unheard, or struggle to resolve conflicts?
    * **Values Differences:** Are you fundamentally different in how you see the world, your goals, or your priorities?
    * **Lack of Respect:** Do you feel disrespected, belittled, or dismissed?
    * **Loss of Attraction:** Has the physical or emotional attraction faded?
    * **Feeling Unfulfilled:** Do you feel your needs aren’t being met in the relationship?
    * **Trust Issues:** Is there a lack of trust, betrayal, or insecurity?
    * **Feeling Trapped:** Do you feel like you're sacrificing your own happiness for the sake of the relationship?
    * **Change in Feelings:** Have your feelings fundamentally changed, and you don't see a future together?
* **Rate the Severity:** On a scale of 1 to 10, how intense are these feelings?  A persistent 8 or 9 is a bigger signal than a fleeting 3.
* **Journaling:** Write down your thoughts and feelings.  This can help you process them and see patterns.
* **Consider Your Needs:** What do you *need* in a relationship to be happy and fulfilled? Are those needs being met? Are you willing to compromise on those needs?

**2. Evaluate the Relationship - Objectively Assessing the Situation:**

* **Past Attempts to Fix Things:** Have you and your boyfriend tried to address these issues? If so, what were the results? Did you both commit to change?
* **His Willingness to Change:** Is he willing to acknowledge the problems and put in the effort to work on them?  A relationship needs *both* partners to invest.
* **His Behavior Patterns:** Are there recurring behaviors that are damaging to the relationship? (e.g., stonewalling, blaming, criticism, defensiveness)
* **The Overall Dynamic:**  Is the relationship generally positive, or is it mostly negative?  Do you spend most of your time feeling drained or anxious?
* **Consider the ""Red Flags"":** Are there any warning signs like controlling behavior, abuse (emotional, verbal, physical), or disrespect?  If so, ending the relationship is a priority for your safety and well-being.

**3. Visualize the Future - What Does a Continued Relationship Look Like?**

* **Can You See a Happy Future?**  Honestly assess if you can realistically envision a fulfilling and joyful life with this person in the long term (5, 10, 20 years?).
* **What Would You Be Giving Up?**  What opportunities or experiences would you be sacrificing if you stayed in the relationship?
* **How Would You Feel in a Year, Five Years?**  Imagine yourself a year from now, still in this relationship. Would you be content, or would you still be feeling this way?

**4. Talking to Someone You Trust (Carefully):**

* **Choose Wisely:** Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist.  Pick someone who will offer honest, unbiased advice, not just tell you what you want to hear.
* **Be Cautious About Venting:** While it's helpful to talk through your feelings, be mindful of how much you're relying on others to make the decision for you.

**5. Making the Decision & Taking Action:**

* **There's No ""Perfect"" Time:** Don't wait for everything to be perfect.  Sometimes, the timing is just right to make a change.
* **If You Decide to End It:**
    * **Plan the Conversation:** Think about what you want to say clearly and calmly.
    * **Be Direct and Honest (But Kind):**  ""I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I’ve realized that this relationship isn’t working for me anymore.”
    * **Avoid Blame:** Focus on “I” statements (“I feel…” instead of “You always…”).
    * **Be Prepared for His Reaction:** He may be angry, sad, confused, or in denial.
* **If You Decide to Stay (For Now):**  Make a plan to address the issues you've identified, and be prepared to re-evaluate regularly.

2995,I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.,"The older I get, the more I believe that our real task isn't to 'find' ourselves. We're already 100% ""there."" What we do have to do is become more mindful of the times when we feel the most alive, most happy, most creative, and most fully engaged with life. It is in those moments that we find ourselves.For example, I couldn't help loving the people or things I loved, no matter who tried to talk me out of them. All I needed to do was notice when my heart opened and I felt the most alive--not because I was afraid or addicted, but because in those moments, I was in contact with my highest self. On the flip side, I needed to recognize the people and activities that consistently brought out the worst in me--the ones that made me feel controlled, constricted, dishonest, resentful, or afraid--and be honest about them. Mindfulness of ""what already is"" is the key to finding yourself. Align yourself with the people and activities that matter most to you. Don't let old habits, crappy jobs, or mean-spirited people define you. Just stumble your way forward as best you can, with greater self-awareness followed by affirmative action..   ","Okay, that's a really brave and honest thing to admit. It takes a lot of courage to say you don’t know who you are, and it’s incredibly common. You're not alone at all. Feeling like you're adrift, without a clear sense of self, is a really complex and often painful experience. 

Let's just start by acknowledging how you're feeling. It's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to feel confused, uncertain, and even a little lost. **It’s a perfectly valid feeling, and it’s okay to not have a clear sense of ""who you are"" right now.**

Here’s a breakdown of things we can talk about, and some ideas that might help:

**1. Validating Your Feelings:**

*   **It's a Journey, Not a Destination:** Finding yourself isn’t a quick fix. It's a lifelong process of exploration, learning, and growth.
*   **Comparison is the Thief of Joy:** Don't compare yourself to others. Everyone’s journey is different, and people define themselves in different ways.
*   **It’s Okay to Change:** Who you are can evolve over time. That’s a natural and healthy part of life.

**2. Let's Explore Some Potential Reasons (We don't need to figure them out immediately, just acknowledging them can help):**

*   **Past Experiences:** Sometimes, past trauma, difficult relationships, or significant life events can make it hard to know who you are. They can shape your beliefs and behaviors without you consciously realizing it.
*   **Societal Pressures:** We’re constantly bombarded with messages about what we *should* be – career goals, relationship expectations, appearance standards, etc. This can make it hard to listen to your own inner voice.
*   **Lack of Self-Reflection:** Maybe you haven't spent enough time thinking about what you truly enjoy, what's important to you, and what your values are.
*   **Mental Health:** Sometimes, feeling disconnected from yourself can be a symptom of anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions.

**3. What Can You Do Now? (Small Steps are Key)**

*   **Start with Small Things:** Don't try to solve everything at once. Focus on one small thing you can do to connect with yourself.
*   **Spend Time Alone:** Even if it feels uncomfortable, carve out some quiet time for yourself.
*   **Try New Things:** Explore different hobbies, activities, and interests. You might discover something you love or a new part of yourself.
*   **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you understand them better.  You could just start with ""I feel..."" statements.
*   **Talk to Someone You Trust:** Sharing your feelings with a friend, family member, or therapist can be incredibly helpful.
*   **Self-Care:** Prioritize your physical and mental well-being – get enough sleep, eat healthy, exercise, and do things that make you happy.

**4. I'm Here to Listen:**

I want to be a safe space for you to explore these feelings.  I can’t *tell* you who you are, but I can:

*   **Listen without judgment.**
*   **Help you brainstorm ideas.**
*   **Offer different perspectives.**
*   **Just be a supportive presence.**

**To help me understand how to best support you, could you tell me a little more about what’s going on?  You don’t have to answer everything at once.  Perhaps you could answer one or more of these questions if you feel comfortable:**

*   Can you describe how you feel when you think about “who you are”? (e.g., confused, empty, frustrated, etc.)
*   Is there anything specific that triggered this feeling, or has it been building up over time?
*   What are some things you *do* enjoy, even if you don’t know why? (e.g., certain types of music, activities, or subjects)
*   On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being ""completely lost"" and 10 being ""completely confident in who I am,"" where would you rate yourself right now?",0.4364997148513794
2461,"Whenever I run into a situation that makes me upset or angry, I tend to start cursing and badly offending the person I am confronting. I say mean things to let my anger out. Whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship (like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship) I lash out not just them but at my boyfriend. I feel like I keep causing drama due to my personality. I want to be a better person and learn to let things not get to me and be happy and graceful. I hurt the ones I love with my words. I want to be better for myself and them.","Congratulations on making your way to Step One, self-observation and deciding to change a feature about how you understand and relate to others.There is extraordinary strength in being willing to notice your effect on others and consider what changes are possible.Start on the inside track of your own heart and mind.  Once you're able to understand what is driving your emotions to the point where the only reasonable way of handling them is to curse and offend people, you'd have gotten a long way in knowing your own expectations of others and how far off the mark from this in your mind, they are.For example, if you expect others to always be accepting, tolerant and happy about situations with your boyfriend, and you're hearing otherwise from people, then you can prepare yourself for possible, less than positive comments about your relationship, or you can ask people to not comment to you about your relationship at all.Basically, the more you know about yourself and are willing to accept your right to ask others to respect your views, the easier and calmer time you'll have in handling comments from others that you're not glad hearing.Also, this is a long process because you'd be trying to change long time and deep patterns of interacting.Be patient with your own learning curve and certainly consider therapy for yourself in order to have some outside guidance and support for the process you're placing yourself.","Okay, let's unpack this. What you're describing is a really common struggle, and the fact that you recognize it and *want* to change is a huge, positive first step. You've identified a pattern of behavior that’s causing pain, and you're taking responsibility for it – that's incredibly powerful. Let's break down what's happening and explore some ways to move forward.

**Understanding What's Driving This**

* **Anger as a Release Valve:** You’ve correctly identified that cursing and saying hurtful things is a way you release anger. This isn't about being inherently malicious; it’s often a subconscious reaction to feeling overwhelmed, threatened, or vulnerable.  It's your body's way of trying to cope with intense emotions, even if it's a destructive one.
* **Feeling of Loss of Control:** When you're angry, you likely feel like you're losing control.  Lashing out can be a way to regain a sense of power, even if it's a temporary and damaging one.
* **Vulnerability and Fear:** The rumors and negative comments about your relationship are triggering a deep vulnerability. You're likely feeling threatened to your relationship and your sense of security. This vulnerability fuels the anger and the defensive reactions.
* **Low Self-Esteem (Possibly):** Sometimes, these reactions are linked to underlying feelings of insecurity. When you feel threatened, it can be a reflection of a deeper need to protect yourself and your relationship.

**What You Can Do – A Multi-pronged Approach**

1. **Recognize the Trigger & Pause:** This is *crucial*. The first step is becoming more aware *in the moment*. When you feel the anger rising, catch yourself.  Recognize the physical sensations – your heart racing, clenched fists, tense jaw.  Then, *pause*.  Don't react immediately. This gives you a precious few seconds to choose a different response.

2. **Develop Coping Mechanisms:** You need alternative ways to release anger and frustration *without* hurting others. Here are some ideas:
   * **Deep Breathing:** Simple, effective, and can quickly calm your nervous system.
   * **Physical Activity:** Exercise is a fantastic stress reliever.
   * **Journaling:**  Write down your feelings – getting them out of your head and onto paper can be incredibly cathartic.
   * **Talk to Someone You Trust:** A friend, family member, therapist – someone who can listen without judgment.
   * **Grounding Techniques:**  Focus on your senses – what you see, hear, smell, touch, taste. This brings you back to the present moment.

3. **Communication Strategies (When You *Do* React):** You don't have to control every reaction, but you *can* learn to manage the immediate fallout:
   * **""I"" Statements:** Instead of saying, ""You're being awful!"" try, ""I'm feeling really hurt and frustrated by what you're saying.""
   * **Take a Break:** If a conversation is escalating, politely excuse yourself and say you need to think.
   * **Don't Engage in Arguments:**  If the other person is deliberately trying to provoke you, disengage.

4. **Addressing the Rumors & Your Boyfriend:** This is where things get delicate.  It's understandable to want to defend your relationship, but reacting with anger only fuels the fire.  
   * **Talk to Your Boyfriend:**  Openly communicate your feelings about the rumors and how they’re affecting you.  Work together to develop a united front.
   * **Limit Your Involvement:**  You don't need to respond to every rumor. Sometimes, ignoring it is the strongest response.

5. **Seek Professional Support:**  A therapist can provide you with tools and strategies to manage your anger, improve your communication skills, and explore the underlying reasons for your reactions. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be particularly helpful in changing negative thought patterns.

**Important Reminders**

* **Be Kind to Yourself:** You’re learning a new skill. You’re going to slip up sometimes. Don’t beat yourself up. Just acknowledge it, learn from it, and keep practicing.
* **Focus on Progress, Not Perfection:**  You don’t need to be perfect. Small, consistent changes are what matter.
* **Celebrate Your Successes:**  Acknowledge and appreciate the times you *do* manage to respond in a calm and constructive way.
