"We weren't long distance until he joined the military.  I love him and I know he loves, me but it's complicated. He said he's not going to find someone else, but I'm afraid. How do I keep our relationship going?","You're wise to be aware of possible changes to your relationship once your bf is away from you for extended time periods.All you both can do is state your intentions and wishes, keep in contact as much as possible, and wait to see how your relationship unfolds.To a large degree, each of you is relying on faith that if the relationship is meant to last for a while, then it will.   The military may add stress.This doesn't necessarily mean the stress will dissolve the relationship.Sometimes all anyone is able to do, is try.","I suggest getting to know him more deeply so you can better know whether your love for him is more or less intense than what he feels. If you like him and want to have more and more connection to him, do this as an act of love.",0.3194846510887146
"I have no real friends. I have a girlfriend who irritates me but loves me to death. I push her away and pushes me away. We’re going through a breakup, and I have nobody.","Having time all to yourself may be necessary so you have time to reflect on your own identity and values, become more clear on what matters most to you, and with this increased self-understanding, be able to attract people who will feel like satisfying friends.Having a relationship with someone whom you push away and are pushed away, with someone who is irritating, seems to have limited benefit for each of you.Maybe you are together from fear of being alone, and being alone is exactly what you may now need in your life in order to draw more favorable people to you.","It is hard to be single, it is okay to have sad days. We all do it. There is no need to punish yourself. Try to talk to your girlfriend of how you are feeling so she can understand how you are hurting and you can offer the same to her. If talking to her isn’t possible, talk to someone else, someone who you trust and can talk to in confidence. Also try focusing on yourself for a while, focus on what you want in life and how you can get there. What is making you stay in your relationship? It isn't the one which is making you happy, look for other relationships to fill the areas of your life which are missing. I hope you find some peace of mind.",0.4493953585624695
I feel like my time is going too fast,"Thank you for reaching out! That is a great question! As an American, I can truly say that I spend way too much time on the go! It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe! I often ask myself, what if I only had one day left on this Earth? What would I do? Well, that is an easy question. I would spend it with my family! Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World, right? Its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring.Time management is a very important factor when learning to ""live life to the fullest""! In fact, this is a required course in undergraduate college now. Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this. Personally, for myself I like to keep a calendar with a to-do list. I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list. That way, if I do not get through the list, I am not stressing over the little things. When planning your day, it is important you schedule work, eat and play. A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. There is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this, then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse/partner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there. Again, everyone has their own style on time management. I hope this was helpful for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out for anything further!","We all have the experience that the time is moving too fast.There are many different perspectives on this.We do not change when the passage of time changes.You may feel like the time is moving very fast because you are going through major life changes (such as having children, going through a divorce, changing jobs, moving from place to place) and experiencing a very rapid change in your situation.What are the significant things that are happening in your life at the moment? Do you feel that your relationships are very stable? What are your own hopes and expectations for the future?Sometimes it feels faster than it really is because we are so occupied with these immediate things that we are missing a broader perspective of the way the world actually is.Do you feel that you feel your life is going too fast and that you wish you had more time for everything?If so, what if you were able to create a little bit more space in your life to make things more manageable? What are some things you would like to get more of into your life? What are some things that seem out of balance? Do you feel you are too stressed? When you feel stressed, it seems that time flies by even faster!I would suggest that your own awareness of the issue - ""my time seems to be passing too quickly"" - might be an opportunity to reflect on your current state of mind.",0.28772908449172974
"He wants to wear makeup and heels. He even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina. He wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him. I have tried this for him, but I don’t like it and have told him so. He keeps making comments about it and says he can't live without it.","It sounds like you may be asking two different questions.With regard to what you said about your husband dressing as a female in your bedroom, I wonder if you would consider asking him more about this. If you choose to do that, I would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience. This can be difficult to do at times, particularly when you may want to offer your own opinions or become very anxious or of type. Consider thinking of a phrase that may help you to stay calm during the discussion. It may be helpful to think of yourself as asking questions as if you were an investigative reporter and using questions that start with words like ""what, how, who, where, when."" Questions that start with ""why,"" can be very difficult to answer for some people and can be overwhelming because it often links to answers involving emotions that may or may not be understood. Also try restating what your husband is saying to make sure that you are understanding correctly. If what he is telling you is different than what you have heard or thought of for many years, it may be challenging to follow his meaning initially. Remember that listening to your husband does not imply agreement with what he is saying, just that you are following and looking to understand what he is experiencing. I also recommend sticking to one topic for the conversation, but this could be done with many different topics over time.You could also see if he would be willing to have a discussion where he listens like an investigative reporter to learn more about the experience that you are having.As far as what you mentioned about the sexual experience, maybe if you can discuss what it is that you don't like and/or understand what it is that he does like, you could see if there is some middle ground here. It depends on what you both prefer.These types of conversations can be difficult to have for some couples, at least initially. Having structured conversations, such as the ones I've described briefly above, can feel awkward initially, but the reason it can be helpful is because it can lead to further understanding in a way that decreases the chances of having an argument.Also consider seeing a therapist in your area who specializes in couples to discuss some of these ideas.","How do you communicate with your boyfriend about how this makes you feel?This is a huge difference in your sexual desires and your boyfriend seems unwilling to honor them.You may need to decide what is more important - to maintain this relationship and tolerate your personal discomfort with your boyfriend's desire for you to engage in a sexual act you do not wish to do, or leave him. You have tried communicating your discomfort, but he does not seem willing to listen to you.Have you tried pointing out how this affects both of you?If you've shared your disagreement in how to perform sex, and he doesn't respect this and has given you demands, then he's not respecting your boundaries.You may need to consider how this impacts your relationship because it seems like a core difference in how you each like to engage sexually and that is going unaddressed.Be honest about the way you feel.If he won't respect that, you have some tough decisions to make.",0.41657865047454834
"I am a really shy person. I'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?","First of all, way to go in stretching yourself out of your comfort zone! You are sure to grow through all of this practice presenting to your peers, and that in itself will help to grow your confidence over time. In the meantime, do whatever you can to help yourself feel prepared for each presentation. Do your work ahead of time so that you feel well-informed on your topic, and then spend the days leading up to your presentation practicing. Do your presentation in the mirror, while you are driving (if it won't distract you from the road), and practice in front of a friend. On the day of the presentation, eat a balanced meal, get a pep talk from a supportive friend, use deep breathing to keep your body calm, and remind yourself that you are prepared. You got this!","One question I always ask is why are you nervous to do presentations? The answer usually reveals a lot, and usually it points to a common fear (i.e. feeling judged, fear of messing up, etc.). Once you understand why you are nervous, you'll be in a much better position to overcome the anxiety. If you want some additional thoughts on why you're feeling this way, here are some other things that can help:1. Know your audience and them the more you can. If you know more about them, you'll be more likely to gain the audience.2. Practice in a safe space and with others you trust.3. Think of your presentations as conversations, not performances.4. Be a little bit uncomfortable. Try to work out the discomfort you feel in doing something you aren't good at, you will become better at it as you grow into it.  And again, this only works once you understand and feel more secure about the reasons why you are nervous. Finally, if you feel this is a major issue in your life, a therapist is always a great option to discuss further, as they can often help you uncover deeper roots.",0.4727315306663513
"I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental.
   I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?","It is very good news that you realize the risks of smoking cigarettes while pregnant and are willing to stop.Thinking about smoking is a typical and frequent reaction to being without the substance.Be creative with what you know about yourself to distract you when this psychological urge comes up.  My suggestions are to imagine smoking if you find this would relieve the sense of wanting to smoke.Or, do the opposite and remind yourself of all the good reasons to not smoke.Also, since you're planning pregnancy then ask your partner for ideas on how to make the psychological feeling to want to smoke, feel less intense.Another suggestion is that your partner is your texting buddy to stop smoking.   With AA groups, a sponsor is always available for the alcoholic who feels distress about the urge to drink.   Having a trusted and caring person to tell about your problem helps in many situations.  Maybe it will help you to stop smoking.Good luck!","The answer to this question is difficult because the factors that lead to addiction vary from person to person. That said, some general steps may be helpful. When you’re trying to quit a substance, you are attempting to change behavior; you are also attempting to re-train your brain and alter your chemistry. These are both big things and it’s okay to feel a little nervous or anxious. Sometimes the physical dependency is less than the psychological dependence. If the physical symptoms that come from smoking are more manageable than the behavioral cues and thoughts, you will be less likely to relapse. It’s also wise to avoid situations that have been linked to your smoking, for a while; it may take a month or two before situations are completely new. In the first few weeks after quitting, it’s important to find your triggers - some people may even take a buddy to bars, for example, in order to avoid being alone in a place where they tend to smoke. It’s important to be kind to yourself when you relapse; don’t use it as a reason to make the problem worse, simply move on and try again. If your are using nicotine gum, or nicotine patches, or other medication to help you stop, make sure that you are taking them as directed; these medications are very effective if used correctly.",0.4326852560043335
"I found the guy I’m dating on dating websites. He was telling women that they were beautiful. He said it wasn’t him and that the phone was hacked. It has since happened two other times. He says he loves me and I’m the only girl he wants to be with, but I feel he is not telling me the truth.","I would suggest possibly talking about the type of relationship that both of you want to create. For example, you may want a relationship where honesty, listening, compassion, and romanticism are major parts. You could also see what your boyfriend wants.You may also consider taking five minutes to see if he will listen to your feelings about him being on the dating site and whether he can work to learn more about what you are experiencing with asking open-ended questions (not being answered with yes or no) and restating what you are saying to see if he has it right. After that, perhaps you could switch so that you can listen to his perspective for five minutes and learn more about what he is doing by asking open-ended questions.Remember that it takes two people to have  a relationship, so the choice is yours as to whether you choose to stay in the relationship and what kind of relationship you would like to have.","We're rarely ever sure that the people we are dating have been hacked. It is difficult to know whether or not the person is being honest with you. Since the two other women he says had their phones hacked also told you that, maybe he is being honest, or maybe his phone was hacked. However, I recommend that you consider what you might feel if you heard someone was hacked. Would you not feel like you could trust them? Even though this doesn't give you any direct answers, I do suggest that you consider if you would still trust them, if they were hacked.  If you decide that you want to stay with this guy then be very open with him to let him know that you would believe him if the other women were telling the truth. The other possibility of how to know if he is honest with you is to use this to end the relationship. As long as you are still unsure, I recommend to stay away from social media so there is no more evidence for you to come across online. Then you can give yourself some time to process what you learned, and if you need help with that, you can talk to a counselor.",0.4434254765510559
"After I told them, they yelled at me.","It's most important that you accept yourself and surround yourself with a group of friends who are kind to you and love you.

"I’ve been on 0.5 mg of Xanax twice a day for the past month. It hasn't been helping me at all, but when I take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack, it calms me down. I was wondering how I can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking I'm abusing them. I just have very big anxiety attacks. Should I stay on the 0.5mg and deal with the attacks or should I ask to up the dose? I'm afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else.","Do you think you're abusing xanax?It is a highly addictive drug so maybe one reason you feel compelled to take more is bc you already are addicted.Drugs don't do anything helpful in solving life's problems.   Once the effect wears off, the stressful situation is once again waiting for you to address it.Think over your reason for not directly asking your psychologist about upping your dose.Also, do you ever talk about your life problems with this psychologist or only your need for drugs?    The more gradual path to a better life is to not need drugs in the first place. This consists of your willingness to face the matters that are creating such terrible feelings inside you.","It depends on how you are feeling when you're on that .5mg of Xanax.If you are feeling the side effects that are typical for Xanax when you take higher doses (like sedation, slurred speech, etc...), then you are wise to ask for less.When your anxiety is moderate (say, a little scared to speak in public, for example), then a small dose of Xanax can be really helpful.If you are on this small dose and you find it's not doing enough, it's possible that your anxiety is growing and/or you are becoming less tolerant to Xanax.If that's what's happening, then you should definitely talk to your psychologist about the issue so that you can find some other medicine to give you more relief.",0.44314348697662354
We've been dating for two months now. I have a heavy past that gets him angry. Does he have a right to penalize me for things I did before I met him?,"How is he penalizing you?Have you asked for his reasons for wanting to know about your heavy past?His answers may be very different than that he would like penalizing you.What you can do is explain how pressured you feel by his questions.Ideally, the two of you will become much closer by talking openly about your respective discomforts and wishes from the other.","It is extremely complicated that your boyfriend wants to punish you for past behaviors. The great news is that it is not your job to punish him. Your boyfriend does not get to penalize you for past behaviors. Everyone makes mistakes and learns from them and then moves forward. It is okay to be angry at people who treat you poorly. It is not healthy for a relationship to contain anger and resentment. You deserve to be respected. You are entitled to forgiveness, once you have made an effort to not repeat old mistakes. You are not trapped in your past; you are entitled to forgiveness and move forward to a new relationship. If your boyfriend feels he needs to know you have made your decision to move forward then he needs to talk about this. This is normal in relationships, but punishing each other is not ok. There are ways to support each other. You deserve this. This is not your job to help him learn, only to move on without him. I wish you the very best in your relationship with your boyfriend.",0.4657254219055176
Every winter I find myself getting sad because of the weather.  How can I fight this?,"Sometimes its quite literally the lack of sunshine that can affect our mood - in these cases it can be worth experimenting with a sun lamp, to boost your dose of vitamin D, when the sun isn't naturally out. Also consider, what is it that the change in weather, changes in your life? If for example, when its sunny you are an outdoorsy, active person and when the weather changes, you're whole activity level changes along with it, you could explore how to get some of that activity replicated indoors in the winter months.","Well for starters you can remind yourself that winter will not last forever, for in the end there is a break of sorts in which you'll get some nice warm weather. Also you might find some activities you enjoy doing indoors during this time. Things such as getting into movies and watching them with loved ones or cooking and doing some home repairs together or even having fun with new arts and crafts, this may help to keep you entertained. Don't take this as a sign you have seasonal depression because seasonal depression is an all year condition but rather an all season or more likely seasonal depression. If you find you are feeling low and sad for more than just the winter time this may be a sign you need a therapist. They can help you identify the issues that are causing your depression, if they exist and also assist you in learning coping mechanisms.",0.4314589500427246
"I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental.

I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?","Hi. Good for you in planning ahead to do what's healthiest for your baby (and yourself). That's a great first step! It's also good that you are able to identify that it's not always a physical need that's driving the addiction.For the next steps, I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological (or mental) cravings are usually based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if you're consciously trying to quit, you'll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. Well, if I'm on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually I'll give in and eat it.You're going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. That's normal and, for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. That's what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it (""Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now.""), but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.I've suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they're going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.Best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby!","Smoking is both physically and mentally addictive.  Although you can get away with just two cigarettes a day and your body would be fine, your mind may always be thinking about that 8th one.  Many people are thinking about this and have to quit smoking.  A few ways to help might be:  1.  Find a way to occupy your mind while smoking, such as reading, chewing gum, or anything that can take your mind off it.  2.  Try to eliminate triggers, so when you are in social settings with people that you smoke with, do not engage in smoking.  There are some support groups for people who are trying to quit smoking.  Check your local hospital or city health department to see if there are any available.  There are many things that make it tough to quit smoking but that you can get through. Good luck!",0.4225420355796814
"I'm transgender, I know I am, but I've only told a few friends. I know I can't tell my family because of previous conversations we've had. They just wouldn't accept it.
My gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own. I need some strategies for dealing with it. What should I do?","Hello, and thank you for your question. I am so glad that you reached out for help. I know that the dysphoria can feel nearly impossible to handle, especially since you have limited support from people who accept who you are. You may already know some of these resources, but I am going to share a few. 1. The website www.letsqueerthingsup.com is a blog from a very good writer that I know. His name is Sam Dylan Finch, and he is transgender. He writes about mental health, transgender issues, and many other topics. I know he has frequently written about gender dysphoria and ways to manage it. You may want to check out his site and do a search on there. 2. The website www.everydayfeminism.com employs many transgender writers and several have written about gender dysphoria and have given ideas for managing it. If you search for gender dysphoria on their site, many articles pop up. It may be a good resource for you, especially if you ever feel lonely and start to forget that there are others out there who are like you and have your back. 3. I am not sure where you live, but there are counselors who specialize in affirmative therapy, which is what is recommended for folks who are part of the LGBTQ community. So, if you decide to see a counselor about the dysphoria, try to find one that specifically says they have been trained in the affirmative approach. In addition, feel free to ask questions of the counselor before agreeing to see them for counseling. An ethical counselor would have no problem answering them before having you come in. 4. If there are some LGBTQ resource centers in your area, try to reach out to them and see if there are support groups. Gaining more support from others would be helpful. Sometimes LGBTQ-friendly counselors leave their contact information for people in resource centers. 5. Finally, I know you have not mentioned being depressed or suicidal, but I also know that it is very common for people to consider suicide when they are struggling with dysphoria, dealing with transphobia, etc. If this ever happens to you, please call 911 or the Trans Lifeline. It's free at 877-565-8860. Visit their site at www.translifeline.org. I hope some of these ideas help. Feel free to send another message if you have a follow-up question.Be well....be YOU.Robin J.

"Whenever I leave my girlfriend I get panic attacks. I'm taking medications to control them, but I'm thinking of moving in with her since I get so anxious.","I’m sorry to hear that you are currently experiencing panic attacks. I hope that the medication you have been prescribed has provided you with some relief. Unfortunately, I don’t feel that moving in with your girlfriend would alleviate your anxiety. Although you may feel very anxious about leaving her, your body is reacting to this stressful event in your life in an unhealthy manner. You may be able to render this particular situation but it’s likely that you may experience another panic attack when an additional stressful event arises. Therefore, it is essential that you address the reason for why you are experiencing panic attacks in the first place followed by practicing coping mechanisms in the case that one would arise in the future.Talk therapy has shown to be effective with those affected by anxiety along with breathing exercises and yoga. A trained therapist will be able to assist you in finding the right stress reducing method so that you can reduce the chance of another attack occurring.I wish you the best of luck! It sounds like you are very happy in your relationship and I hope you are able to reduce your anxiety so that you are able to enjoy one another.","Having panic attacks can be very distressing and very isolating. It's not uncommon for people who suffer from anxiety, especially panic attacks, to have relationship patterns that they are unaware of. If you are working with a therapist it may be helpful to explore if you have unhealthy relationship patterns like avoiding conflict or being controlling so as to avoid triggering panic attacks. I also wonder if you would be open to a partner panic anxiety course? There are some good resources online but it can be very helpful. Do you and your girlfriend discuss your own anxieties as well as your own feelings?",0.46571606397628784

I'm also glad that you know that you don't want to tell anyone. I believe that taking care of yourself is something that must be done whether you tell anyone or not. This is one of those situations where ""If you will take care of yourself, then you will be much better off in the long run, whether you tell anyone or not."" I understand that it can be difficult to reach out for help, especially if you have been experiencing depression for an extended amount of time. Sometimes I think that many people are afraid that something is wrong with them and they fear that if they tell someone that they are feeling depressed they will be diagnosed and/or put on medication. If you're worried about a diagnosis, I'd encourage you to discuss your concerns with a professional. Usually, the first step is to talk with a primary care physician or your PCP. Most people find medication to be helpful and even some people benefit from alternative non-medication approaches.If you do go to see a therapist, you don't necessarily have to tell them that you've tried medication. Therapy is a judgement-free zone and therapists are trained to listen to people with no judgement. My best advice would be to find out more about what depression is and what types of treatments are available to you.

"I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.
I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. While your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard. Talk to them during a non-emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as ""you NEVER listen,"" ""you ALWAYS say..."" and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with ""you"" try using ""I"" by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist, teacher, or school counselor if possible. Most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help.Best of luck to you.","This sounds like a tough time. Teenagers go through a lot with parents, but a family seems like a good place for us to be. One of the best thing you can do right now is talk to your dad about your dad's feeling about your childhood, the one he took from you. It seems that you believe that if he won't accept you and your family in your own way, then you'll be fine on your own. Well, the great part is that there are two adults in your family, and if he won't accept you, then you can accept him too. I don't know how old you are or how you parents may see it. But maybe if you don't think they understand, this is also part of why you don't feel that they take you seriously. As parents we are not naturally inclined to understand the minds of our kids...especially when they are older. Maybe if you start to talk to them as adults, and not as kids, then you may feel more respected and heard. About your friends...well, you are not alone. Many teenagers feel this way. Also, it's just as easy to go find a friend who will understand and be willing to listen as it is to stay with one who doesn't. The way you learn is to believe in yourself and your ideas. It's okay for you to think you are pansexual if you are! I'd encourage you to see a therapist and find out what kind of things you can do to help yourself feel ok with this part of you.",0.395996630191803
"My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the ""straight and narrow"" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that I'm not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others.    His insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","You might ask your fiance about people who have let him down in the past; past hurts from parents, friends, people he has dated. If you are speaking about jealousy he may come from a divorced parent upbringing, may have seen parents cheat on one or the other, may have had partners cheat on him in the past.  He may have fears that you may go off the ""straight and narrow"" once you get married. Listen to any concerns with patience and understanding, avoid being defensive. I would highly encourage pre-marital counseling to explore these things and individual counseling for himself to work on fears and anxieties. If he refuses and things do not improve I would consider postponing the wedding, things will not get better once you get married, only magnified.  Finally show him Bible passages about forgiveness and worry and leaning on God with faith and hope for the future.    God bless.","It sounds like there could be some healing going on within your fiancé. Maybe he feels like he is becoming more vulnerable with you, and if so, it could be that he is allowing himself to feel things and be more honest with you now, which has not been the case for him or you for some time, based on what you say.There is a difference between a past, an earlier life, and a current identity.  When we were a teenager, for example, and not so great at school or at a job, we lived on a student budget for a month or two and got a part time job.  Our ""student period"" (which lasted for approximately a couple of years) was part of our lives and was quite real and impactful at the time, for good or ill.  It was a past, but it wasn't us.   But the point is that your past has not affected who you are now. The past has made you the person you are now and that is a good thing.  Your fiancé does not know the full scope of your past and he feels really insecure about who you are. I am assuming this is how he feels because it has not been the case in the past, and so this is very new for him.   If this were something that he has not previously had to deal with, then this feeling is new and scary, and if we want a loving, fulfilling and secure life, we have to be able to move beyond these kinds of insecurities.  How can he learn to love himself more?  This is the question and the answers could range from self help to professional help. If you can make some suggestions of the ways he can increase his self esteem and trust, then he may be open to having that conversation with you, which could help you both move toward greater stability.   Sometimes our past behaviors can be addressed by practicing new behaviors and not dwelling on the old ones.   The old behaviors are behind us, of course, but they have been part of who we have been.  Learning more about your past will help him, but he needs to focus on learning more about himself first.",0.4236268997192383
My fiancé and I broke up. He cheated on me numerous times. I kept forgiving but questioning his every move. He got tired and left.,"Cheating on you shows a lack of commitment, in addition to the emotional hurt it creates.Probably you didn't actually forgive him because if you did, then you wouldn't have been asking questions of his every move.Maybe you were open to forgiving him.   In order for forgiveness to be effective, the person who has done the injuring must first show some understanding and empathy for the great pain the person caused in you.From what you write, your fiancé didn't seem to have much interest in earning back your trust or in empathizing with the way his cheating effected you.It is very likely his tiredness is also tiredness you feel, of having to watch him all the time.As uncomfortable as adjusting with the disappointment of him leaving you, the situation you describe sounds like it was unsatisfying for both of you.","Sorry that you are going through this. You are doing all the right things, and you should talk to a good counselor, not the first one you come across.  You can also use any form of media you find helpful, i.e. a self-help book or a support group with people in your circle of friends.",0.34111759066581726
"My girlfriend and I have broken up and gotten back together numerous times in the past two years. We recently just broke up again last night on New Year’s Eve. When we break up, the very next day, she calls me and acts as if nothing has happened. She acts like everything is alright. This has been going on for two years. I do love her and care about her and her children a lot, but she seems really demanding as far as what she deserves from a man. She is always telling me that she deserves this and that from a man. It makes me feel like crap because I cannot give her everything that she wants. She told me one time that she wants a man who is going to be afraid to lose her. Is that a normal thing that women want, or should I just move on already? I am in my 30s and she is in her 40s.","Love is not enough to keep a relationship together.The people need to get along happily too.Let's start with knowing more about your happiness in being with your partner.The frequent break ups happen for a reason.  Try understanding more of why you go back together again.You state a few very clear reasons to not continue this relationship, such as ""feeling like crap"" and not liking that your girlfriend hopes her  partner will feel afraid to leave her.Trust your intuition telling you that these feelings matter.Sometimes men aren't sure whether following their instinct is a right action to take.It is.Also, hoping a partner will fear losing them, shows a wish to control a person.Control has nothing to do with love and trust, and these are basics of a relationship.Good luck!","Hello. It sounds like you're torn. You love her and don't like the idea of leaving, but you also feel resentful for feeling dominated. I understand your confusion. What kind of ""need"" are you fulfilling with your girlfriend? She sounds addicted to getting ""high"" from needing someone. She is using your love as a temporary fix for insecurities. Do you love who she is and all she is, or do you love the need she has for you? It's a difference. You also mentioned that your girlfriend tells you what she is supposed to be doing. She's telling you she is in control. What happens to you when you stop trying to please her? Does she kick you out as well? It sounds like the relationship is not healthy. What I like about you is that you're not letting go easily. You're giving her the benefit of the doubt. But not giving yourself the benefit of the doubt or what you want is damaging you. If nothing changes, then you have no more patience to wait. Move on. There is someone who will love what is in you.",0.45803624391555786
"My coworkers are making false statements about me to the boss, saying I have mood swings. They have no proof to back it up. Can my employer make me see a therapist of their choice?","If this is a concern of a few coworkers, make sure it is not something they see but you don't admit to.  Employers can ""suggest"" or something ""stipulate"" in continued employment with them  for you to go to their Employment Assistance Provider (EAP) if they have noticed the same behavior and concerned of how it is effecting productivity or employee relationships.  No one wants to work in a environment which they consider hostile.  Employers can be held responsible if they do not take action.Couple of things you can do...Ask a coworker in which you trust and respect if what others are saying is true?Seek professional help from your primary care provider or counselor if mood swings do exist.      ","You can talk with your boss about your job and say that he has to respect your privacy. Then ask if he would like to speak with a therapist regarding his feelings about your performance, and suggest he do so privately.If your boss decides he does want to speak with a therapist, then he is free to send you to the therapist he chooses. It is also possible you would prefer to seek treatment yourself so then you can approach it from a slightly different angle.If you and your boss think it may be beneficial to speak with a therapist about the way you work together, then you could suggest doing it together at the office by taking each of you in turn. In any case, the choice is yours.My suggestions here are based on the belief that you're working on improving your relationship with your boss and not necessarily trying to seek professional help.",0.43785762786865234

"Whenever I don't tell my friends or anyone what I did or stuff that's not really important, I feel terrible, like there’s a hole in my stomach. It only goes away when I hurt myself.","Hi Kansas, I feel strongly that the help of a professional therapist is important here. Feelings are never wrong, but it can help to understand where they come from and talk to someone who can teach you healthy ways to cope. Self-harm is not the answer to managing those emotions you feel in your stomach. Although I'm glad you said something here, a professional would need to spend some time with you and get a deep understanding of your life in order to help you sort all these reactions out effectively. I hope you reach out to someone soon. ","Hi, so you know what I'm going to say. Your feelings of shame don't just magically disappear.  They need to be processed and understood. I'm sorry that you use self-harm as a way of soothing yourself. It's natural to have these feelings when we hurt ourselves, and it's likely that you feel guilt for having done it. The fact that you ""hurt yourself"" is more evidence that you are trying to learn how to soothe and relax. But there is a better way. You can learn coping mechanisms to deal with your feelings of shame and to handle things on your own. It's not something you need to do this way to relieve the pain. You can do it safely with the help of a counselor. You didn't have to hurt yourself in order to learn about yourself. One way is to be with yourself while you feel all the emotions that arise, without trying to get rid of them. I don't mean that you'd be comfortable feeling the physical pain of self-harm.  You can do it safely and effectively without doing it.You may like to read some of the self-help resources I have on this website. I hope you will also consider finding a counselor you can work with. It will take time to figure out the best way for you to handle these feelings in your life. Good luck.",0.5140728950500488
"My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board—no more drinking every night.
 The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.  I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. I just feel like I'm so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty. He is a good husband in every other regard.","As exasperated as you feel, and as obvious it is to you that your husband cares more about drinking than being honest with you, changing this is up to him.Does he care that you're upset with him for drinking more than he can handle?Does he care about you more than drinking?Living with an alcoholic, which is how his behavior sounds, is lonely and frustrating.Concentrate on what you like about him as he is now with his drinking.Your happiness matters.  His ignoring of what you're talking about, doesn't mean your requests are unreasonable.Be prepared to learn to live with and accept how he behaves, or not.Avoid the expectation that you can convince him to change.People change only when they realize their life can improve by changing.  He doesn't sound like this, at least now.","Your husband's behavior has been a huge betrayal, but the way you are approaching it seems healthy. You've identified the problem, you've confronted him once or twice, and you are asking for an honest answer about his behaviors. All of that sounds positive so far. Have you been clear about why you don't like the drinking? I get the impression that he does not like it either, but his action doesn't match his words. You might say something like, ""The problem is your drinking. It is affecting your health, affecting you emotionally, and it is affecting our family in other ways.""  Since you are the one who discovered that he has been drinking, is there some reason you are afraid of his reaction? Is there a possibility of a family member witnessing this? I don't have enough information here to suggest how your husband has been drinking. But I would guess he doesn't like to be caught, and so maybe he is drinking secretly and is not proud of it.  Whatever his reason, maybe if you're honest about the impact it has had on you and your sense of trust, it might help him understand where you are coming from. I'm really glad you are working on this. I wish you the very best.",0.45548397302627563
I have this weird fetish that I'm afraid to open up about it. What should I do?,"This is difficult to answer because you don’t tell us what the fetish is.  I do understand that this is something that is bothering you though. The first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not.  If this is illegal to engage in, then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urges.However, if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd, a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings.  You may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of.  You may find other people have the same interest as you.  Find a therapist that you can trust and tell them.  Don’t hold back with your therapist.  Trust me, they have heard and seen it all by now, and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress, or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are.  There is no need to suffer with this alone. ","Hello. It's interesting that you're concerned that having a fetish is a problem. Fetishes are just natural sexual interests. What is problematic is if the interest interferes with your ability to live a happy, fulfilling life. So let's find out a little more about what you'd like to get out of opening up about this. You say you're afraid. Could you tell me why you're afraid you won't be accepted by your friends, family, or sexual partner?If it's friends, maybe some of your friends would be tolerant of the fetish. If you have a partner, that is a different question. The sex we do with a partner is about connection and pleasure. There can be some people with whom having a certain interest (fetish) might be uncompatible. That doesn't mean that someone won't love you for it, it just means that you probably won't be able to have sex with them about it. As long as you are respecting their boundaries, you should be able to have sexual relations with anyone, and many would consider it a part of who you are. I guess the question is, is your interest a problem to you? If you aren't doing anything wrong and you're not feeling ashamed about it, and you want to be able to open up about it without feeling too much shame, then there is nothing wrong with you. We all have our own, unique interests. I would recommend you find some friends or a therapist who you feel comfortable with and tell them about this. It can be really helpful to get feedback from someone you trust. Also, I recommend you Google something like ""acceptance of fetishes"" or ""shame around fetishes.""

"I have been feeling more and more down for over a month. I have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks, but they are almost never triggered by something that I know of.","Answers about our inner lives are most successfully reached from a sense of feeling grounded in oneself.First step is to accept your nervousness and restless sleep.  As often as possible, sleep during daytimes in order for your body to catch up on its need for rest.Accept too about feeling down.  It is normal to feel down once in a while.  From this place of self-acceptance, trust any answers which come up to your mind.  Often answers about complicated topics come in small pieces, not all at once as a whole unit.Also, your description about panic attacks is also completely normal.   They often arise unrelated to particular conditions at a given moment.  They are a healthy symptom your body is trying to expel bad feelings and does this by having the anxiety erupt at times.So, self-acceptance, tolerance of being on a process of clearing out worn out emotional clutter, and sleep at odd times if possible, are all ways to stabilize yourself, which will also feel calm and good!",It sounds like you are having some serious anxiety.

"I am currently suffering from erectile dysfunction and have tried Viagra, Cialis, etc. Nothing seemed to work. My girlfriend of 3 years is very sexually frustrated. I told her that it is okay for her to have sex with other men. Is that really okay?","Hi, First and foremost, I want to acknowledge your efforts to gain (your) ideal erectile function. If the medications are not working and you have taken them as prescribed, I would encourage you to seek the help of a sex therapist as the dysfunction may be due to a psychological and/or relational issue rather than a physical/medical one. As for your question, only you can answer this. Is it OK? Are you OK with her sleeping with others? Have you thought through what this may look like, feel like, become for you and her? Opening up a relationship is a choice only the people in the relationship can answer. Even then, the answer may change at any point by either of you. I encourage you to also determine what the intention is underneath your telling your girlfriend she could sleep with others. Be clear with the intention and then together have continuous conversations about the expectations of opening up (i.e.: are there any kinds of sex that is off limits, areas of the body where touch or intimacy is not allowed, are uses of safer sex required or not, do you want to know the details or not, so forth). An excellent resource would be the book ""Opening Up"" by Tristan Taormino. I wish you the best of luck!Dr. Lily Zehner, MFT-C","In cases like this, you might consider referring your girlfriend to a therapist. Sexual medicine and sex therapy can certainly help to address your boyfriend's issue with his sexual health, as well as your girlfriend's issue with sexual frustration.

There's only one mind behind the dream, namely your own. The dream doesn't say that you actually are physically hurting others. It is more likely that you are experiencing some form of injustice in the way that men or men in general treat you. Dreams are a symbol system we use to talk to ourselves about our inner workings. They're a tool, and the way we use them shows up in our behavior. Have you asked yourself if you feel safe in relationships? In a job? In other relationships that you have with others? How are you treated by others who are men? So many things could be going on here. Maybe this is about taking on and being taken advantage of by someone. So many different meanings... So you don't know yet if your dream is a sign that something should change in your life? It could be also that these men in your dreams represent something else, such as power, respect, or some other quality that is currently lacking in your life. Take some time to really look at what is happening in your day to day life. The way you wake up the first of the morning shows me that you are probably already trying to resolve this issue.

Do you want to be sexually intimate? Do you enjoy having sex with him? Are you satisfied with your sexual relationship when you are with him? The fact that there is lust for other more attractive men does not necessarily mean anything. There will always be attractive men and more attractive men than your partner and these attractive men will be even more appealing when you are in a long-distance relationship far from the arms of your partner. Loving someone does not mean that you stop being a sexual being who no longer notices and desires attractive men. Attraction results from a number of factors beyond appearance - including the degree to which you feel emotionally open, safe, and connected and how in tune you are with each other's bodies. It sounds like you think very highly of this man ""everything else is perfect about him"". Maybe it is worth spending some more time together in the same place if that is possible before deciding on marriage or that you are not truly in love. ","It sounds like you have a lot of conflicting feelings.

"My older brother (in his 60s) started dating a lady with Asperger's. She is hyper-sexual and flirty. She does not understand boundaries.

Do we speak honestly and risk losing a relationship?","If you and your brother are open w each other and respect each other’s opinions then there is little risk your relationship with him will end.If there already is strong animosity, mistrust, dislike between both of you then there is more chance he will not seriously consider your advice.For your own peace of mind, say whatever you feel must be said to him.The person you’ll need to live with is yourself so do what you believe is needed for you to feel good about saying what’s necessary.Even if he never follows through with your advice then you’ll still know you tried your best to advise.","Thank you for your question! What a dilemma! The truth is that we each have the right to set our own boundaries with others. When one person sets boundaries, there is no guarantee that the other person will accept them.

If he has made his decision, let him be, no matter if you love her or not.

It's hurtful because I am all about resolving the problem, and he dwells on the issue even if I drop what he's done and just swallow my pride and say I am sorry. How can this be resolved? We have kids, and I don't want a broken family because we can't communicate.","You can't fix this by yourself, but I applaud you for trying. One person working hard in a relationship can make things better for a while., but in the long haul you need two people giving some effort. I'm reading between your lines here and I wonder if your need to keep the family together is getting you to apologize when you've done nothing wrong and ignore things you've felt hurt by. I sense that you're doing all the work...that it's not balanced. I have worked with many couples and I've learned never to underestimate what kind of change is possible; anything is possible. But in order for change in a couple to occur, you need two people who are both willing to own their choices and behaviours, and who have empathy. Your boyfriend doesn't appear to have these components; he pushes you away and blames you when he's done something hurtful.Can you be honest with yourself about what's happening? I encourage you to sit down with a trusted friend or therapist and look at what you have here and what your options are. I wish you well.","The first place I want to go is to understand the source of this ""not feeling loved"" feeling your boyfriend has. This is likely your own question to answer first and foremost. For the next three years you both lived together, did you feel he loved you? Were your interactions with one another loving and respectful? If the answer is ""no,"" then there is a very deep hurt there. This is likely the root of the problem.If you want to work through this it's time for couples therapy. There is nothing to be ashamed about reaching out for support; in fact, it is to be commended.  Two people in your position likely need some help.",0.4622284770011902
"What makes my step child, an 8 year old boy, choke my daughter, a 6 year old girl? This has been going on for 4 years. The boy tells my daughter not to tell on him. He knows it's wrong; we have did time out, spanking, taking away toys, and sitting on the wall. I am afraid for my daughters safety!","I can see why you are alarmed. That is a scary situation for a parent. Do you know if the child has been evaluated by a mental health professional? Early treatment is often the key. A professional will be able to help the child learn how to control their anger and mend the troublesome actions into more appropriate responses. Have you addressed your concerns with the child's other parent? There could be contributing factors in his life that could be causing these issues (exposure to violence, sexual/physical abuse, drug use, stressful events in his life, etc.). It is important that these factors are identified so that they can either be eliminated and/or reduced. I wouldn't hesitate to have him evaluated (if he hasn't been already) and to ensure that he is getting the help that he needs whether it be medication and/or therapy. Until then, I would make sure that he is always supervised under an adult's care.","First of all, you are doing the right thing by asking and trying to resolve the problem.  The most important thing you can do right now is to set limits on hitting and biting.  Also, you want to try to provide opportunities for him to use better ways of getting his needs met.  Can you help him to express his emotions? If so, can you help him practice the better ways? Try to also help him to notice how the effects of his actions on your daughter?

Whether you choose to be open or not is entirely up to you, but it's essential to find someone who respects your privacy who will accept you and you alone. There are many women of all races, religions and orientations who accept and are accepting of crossdressers. There are also many women who do not accept or appreciate crossdressing, however. My advice is to see if you can be open with the people you already trust and you know are already friendly with you, and if they are accepting of you.

"I just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. My family and I really need this job.

People keep telling me I have ""anxiety"" and I'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. This is all new to me. What can I do?","It is ok to have anxiety.   Please don't be anxious about being anxious.If you feel anxiety coming over you, then pull off the road to a safe place.   Concentrate on centering yourself and to breath slowly.   Take some sips of water.  Sit still.     The anxiety should pass in about twenty minutes.If it does not pass, then continue calming yourself until you feel safe enough to drive to your hotel.     You can always explain to your supervisor that you were taking care of a medical problem, because anxiety is a medical problem.","Thanks for your question. First thing to remember is that anxiety is normal and it is not something that should be scary for you. Anxiety can actually be something positive for us as it gives us a chance to recognize when we are feeling overwhelmed and to implement tools to help us regain a sense of control. I'd recommend that you reach out to your Primary Care Provider about trying a medication. For anxiety there are some natural over the counter remedies such as L-Theanine and GABA. While medications can be really helpful it is important to determine whether you can use them in your situation. Some medications can affect your ability to stay alert. Also, medication may not be the best course of action if you start to have a panic attack. In those situations it is important to stay calm by remembering some calming techniques I am going to talk about in just a minute. On the other hand, I think a big part of this is not only managing medications but also establishing routine in the new place. Knowing you have a plan in place when you are traveling alone will definitely help to ease some of your anxiety. Remember that, while a road trip may seem scary to you, I would be willing to bet that a lot of people are driving long distances all the time. Road trips are something that almost everyone does and while you may be terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road it is something that you can take some deep breaths and you can overcome it. Another thing to remember is that you can start taking deep breaths now prior to your travel so it becomes a practiced response for you. When you are traveling I recommend that you find some ways to distract yourself, so you are not thinking about the anxiety. There are tons of podcasts you can listen to, audiobooks and a whole bunch of music to keep you occupied. I know I've seen plenty of road trip playlists. Another thing that you can do is to sing to yourself. My mom and I used to drive to practice for my shows. No one would ever be the wiser and the anxiety of the drive would just simply go away. I'm serious...sing to yourself. It has a calming effect! On a lighter note, a good rule of thumb is to stop for some gas and food. I know it sounds mundane, but it's important, especially when driving long distances. I find that keeping yourself fueled up is key for your energy and staying sharp. Stay healthy and safe on your new adventures!",0.4497082233428955

"I've tried working out and eating fruits and vegetables, but I always seem to eat the junk in the house.","I know some people do better when they don't have as much junk food in the house. This is not as tempting then. Having said that, maybe you can reward yourself with different things, such as having dessert on certain days. If you are concerned about mostly eating habits, consider seeing a nutritionist. They can help you find the balance between what it is that you really want and your goals. I'm not sure how this links to happiness for you, but hopefully looking at your choices can lead you toward your goal of being healthier.","What are your triggers for the junk food? Are you in a lot of stress at work or in your relationships? Sometimes when you are dealing with an emotion, you can feel like you need to eat food to make it go away. Try finding some other coping strategies for when you start to feel those urges to eat unhealthy food. Going to the gym can be a healthy way to deal with stress but if you are so stressed that working out makes it worse than it would be better to find some alternate ways to relax. Are you eating out of boredom or stress? If that is the case maybe find a new hobby to do to help you feel more fulfilled. Have you tried tracking your food intake?

I feel really uncomfortable when I have people's attention.  It makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class. Can I get over this social anxiety?,"you can learn lots of skills/techniques to feel more confident in what you need to do that will decrease your anxious response for sure! :) And  you can also learn how to work with your personality that may not like the attention. You may find that ""talking"" to others through the internet is more comfortable and you are great at it, or that you love one on one talking but aren't really made for group talking. There is a place in this world for you either way! Public speaking skills can be practiced in speech class, or toastmaster group, they will give you practice in a safe environment where the cool kids or cutest boy aren't ready to laugh at you.  What topics are you interested in and what groups can you do a little speaking up? Maybe in your small group at church try and raise you hand to share your opinion, or maybe your Girl Scout troop? Look around for a peer and one adult who you like to hear speak out, ask them to share with you 2 things that help them feel comfortable speaking in public. Check out some Ted Talks and see how they share in groups. Social anxiety is a difficult concern and picking apart what is your awesome personality and what needs skill building and mindfulness/anxiety  help are important steps. Good luck!","Hello. It is difficult for some people to concentrate on the answers they need to give when a person is distracted by how their own body reacts while speaking. The good news is that social anxiety can often be overcome with time and practice. There are some natural things you can do, first, to help yourself. Take slow deep breaths. As your body's anxiety gets higher, it tends to tighten up as an attempt to protect you from what you are afraid of. Sometimes relaxing your body will help release some of the tension. You can also stop thinking about what you are afraid of when you do. If I start thinking about how my mouth is dry or my palms sweaty or whatever other physical symptom I may be experiencing, I tend to pay more attention to those symptoms and they get worse. So, stop paying attention to your physical symptoms. The next time you can, start to direct your thoughts to the other person. Just take your attention off yourself and focus on whatever it is that they are saying. One thing you can also try is to imagine yourself talking to the person you fear will negatively react and picture yourself as the best version of yourself in that conversation. Picture the best answer you could give, imagine the best version of yourself being confident, know you are in control, know how great you are and know your success. If I concentrate on what I am doing well, it helps to keep me calm and confident in social situations. This is not a perfect remedy, but it can help the situation. Be patient with yourself. It takes practice and many small victories for the most part. You will not win every challenge you take on, but each time you handle the social situation successfully, you will gain confidence and grow more competent and confident. What you do to prepare will influence your outcome. Practice social situations to give yourself confidence. Try to put yourself in situations that are challenging. As you get good at doing that, it will reduce the anxiety. Practice daily.  If the anxiety is too strong to overcome on your own, counseling or counseling or therapy is recommended. It can give you tools and techniques you may not be aware of otherwise to overcome the challenges that you are experiencing. I hope this helps.",0.3648359775543213

Can someone please point me in the right direction for help?","Eating disorders usually result from a sense of insecurity about who the person is, whether they are good enough compared with anyone else, and whether the way they person lives is effective.If you have a style you're already happy with to reflect on these sorts of topics, keep following your own logic with the aim to free yourself, which usually takes place gradually, from these sort of self-doubts.The other approach would be to find an unperson or an online discussion group where you'd be able to offer and receive the support from other people who live with a similar problem.Good luck in your studies!","Eating disorders are complex conditions that require professional treatment.  The most important first step is to speak with your doctor (primary care physician or internist). They can give you a referral to a local mental health professional experienced in treating eating disorders and can help you start making changes in your life that will help you have better emotional health. From my experience, it is also helpful to find a peer support group (Overeaters Anonymous, Al-Anon, Alcoholics Anonymous) that have a focus on substance use.  The group dynamic can help you feel more in control while taking the first steps toward recovery.  Here is a link to www.eatingdisorders.org.

I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?,It is absolutely a typical response.  Many of my clients are nervous the first couple of times we meet.  This is essentially a stranger with whom you are sharing your feelings.,"Therapy can be emotional work, and it can shake us up. Some people find that the discomfort reduces as they get to know their therapist and feel more comfortable in the process. Some people feel the emotions more deeply with each session. Either way, I would say it's more ""normal"" to be nervous the first time than to be anxious in subsequent sessions. A good therapist will work with you to help you get comfortable by understanding your needs and fears. If you're unsure if your therapist is the right one for you, that's ok too; they can help you work on what makes you feel more comfortable and comfortable and then recommend someone else if this doesn't help.",0.5424067378044128
"I can't even smile or fake one. I can't feel happiness about anything and I can't show love towards another person not even my girlfriend. I hate myself sometimes. All I see is ugly.
   I can't get over the loss of a loved one and I'm not close to my family. What can I do?","Trust and believe your own feelings.Emotions are real and reflect how someone feels about a situation.Since you're sad about losing a loved one, be patient w your feelings about this.  Basically, be guided by how you feel and eventually you will feel different emotions which I hope will be happier ones.","Hi Seattle, I am so sorry that you are going through this. Losing someone we love, especially someone who has been close, can feel like a part of our own body has gone away. We feel the emptiness in our heart and sense of loss. In the following months, the pain may start to lessen somewhat, and we may feel some joy in certain memories, but the grief may still be with us. Some people get to a place of coping with it. While some may never truly ""get over"" a loss of the person, the impact of the loss reduces, making it feel ""less hard each day"". It's the way we feel about the loss and the way we are managing or coping with it that determines if it will impact us and we will be able to live a full and normal life.One of the most important ingredients in coping with loss is to reach out for support from our friends, family, and other people that we care about. They are likely going through it too, and can bring a sense of comfort and validation that you are not alone. The second ingredient is to make an effort to reach out and participate in normal life, even when it feels difficult. Go to work or school, eat healthy, sleep well, and if you are able to, engage in recreational activities that make you happy. When I see someone struggling with depression, I encourage them to consider counseling. If you have any history of depression, or if you are noticing that your depression is getting worse, it may be even more important to reach out to someone or a therapist. A therapist can help you to learn new ways to cope and process your loss and help to move forward with your life. I wish you well as you go through the grieving process.",0.4906051754951477
"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","From your initial description, I would say that your mother is ""Maloriented"". In this stage of Alzheimer's individuals tend to be blaming and difficult to deal with. They may often hide or throw things away and then blame family members for this. In addition, if they are incontinent, they may blame a leaky roof or something else when they are wet. You are correct that this is not her fault, but often for family members this does not make it any easier for you to cope. I strongly suggest that you learn communication strategies that will help you to communicate with your mother in a way that lets her work through the difficulties associated with the disease. I always suggest Validation techniques to family members.In addition, you need to give yourself some kind attention and take time out from your circumstances as needed. You need to be able to center yourself and come to acceptance that this is your mother's illness that is the problem, not her and certainly not you.","I imagine this is really tough. Sometimes, it can be difficult to take the time we need for what we're experiencing. It's natural to feel guilty, frustrated and overwhelmed, too. It's like living in the eye of a hurricane. A lot of times when we are in these kinds of situations, we want to move away from what we're experiencing. When we do that, we make it harder to handle it. We're not alone in our struggles. You can start by seeking support from someone trusted in your life. Someone who can just listen, or one who understands what you're going through. Taking a break can help you regain your composure and a clearer look at the situation. If you're on the road a lot, consider asking for a passenger to help you on those busy times or days. If you're at home, make sure you are resting. Do you eat enough? A well-balanced diet is helpful. A good night's sleep will help with mood and energy. I would recommend a counselor, if you can, to give you some tools for coping. It may also be worth your while to learn about the disease. Understanding how Alzheimer's progresses can help you to cope with what you're going through. Best of luck to you. This is hard.",0.44923824071884155
"I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it.
 I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call.
 I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive. I know what I'm doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change. How do I stop this behavior and thought process?","Good for you on your keen awareness of your difficulties and your willingness to change!The type of change you'd like to achieve is possible, and since a change in self-confidence and self-love is deep rooted, this comes about gradually and slowly.Keep understanding yourself during your moments of doubt and anxiety.  Its fine to feel terrible and certainly better to know you feel insecure than to act upon the insecurity by being with men who take advantage of you.Everyone needs to feel loved and recognized.Until you attract a partner who will love and appreciate you, develop relationships with co-workers and classmates, neighbors, so that you have some quality of giving and being given by someone.It is a way to nurture yourself and another person until your strength and self-belief grow bigger.","I agree with the other poster on some level - it is not an uncommon behavior for those who have been in relationship with an emotionally unavailable (or emotionally unavailable with others in the past) partner. Some of my friends used to be in those types of relationships and you really do start to think that this is ""normal"".It can be painful, but your ""unusual"" behavior is not one that will be easy to change. It will take conscious effort to re-train yourself as to what you truly value in a partner. The behaviors you are currently engaged in are really based on an assumption that is not factual. You are not actually getting what you need by being emotionally abusive. You are only creating the types of reactions that you see from your ex-boyfriend and other previous partners. You are very clearly creating an emotional hole inside yourself. It will take time and willingness to explore how you were in relationships growing up, why you do what you do, what you really want. I would highly recommend that you seek out counseling for at least the initial three to six sessions. It takes time and commitment to change deeply ingrained patterns. The results will be worth it.",0.4092952609062195
"I was with my friends fishing by a pond. I found a frog and stabbed it with my friend's knife. I'm not sure why I did it. My friends saw me do it it and were shocked and got really mad at me.

Now if someone brings it up I get really upset and panicked. I don't know why I feel like this. Does this mean there is something wrong with me?","The good news is your awareness that being violent to animals feels out of character for you.   I'm glad you have awareness and I'm glad you are not at ease with killing frogs.Fairly likely that you were acting out aggressively toward the frog, feelings of being on the receiving side of similar type of violence.Basically, you did unto the frog what someone has or to you, feels like, has been done to you.Use your surprising finding of how strong your anger and most likely inward pain.   Reflect on your closest relationships and how these people treat you.   It is possible you feel more hurt by someone who is close to you than you ever realized.Stabbing innocent frogs is wrong.  It is understandable as a way to show you how much inner pain you probably have.It is also wrong that someone close to you hurt you.The direction to go is to recognize your pain and then decide how to go about changing what is possible on your side of that or those relationship(s).","Hi There...Not sure what you mean by what's wrong with you. This is a very sensitive issue because people have various feelings and views about killing animals, and some people are very sensitive about this. The only thing that is wrong with you is if you don't know why you are having those feelings. As a starting point in understanding what may be causing those feelings, would you be able to tell me where you come from, your culture, your upbringings and what your beliefs were during your childhood? Do you or have you ever had a pet? Was your family dog or cat killed when you were young? I don't know where you grew up and it's possible these questions may be irrelevant, but you could try them out, and share your answers with a friend, trusted family member or professional. It may also be helpful to find out more about the frog you found. Was it a poisonous frog, a toad, a tree frog? What was the frog doing? Where was the frog found? Was there any significance to its death and what was the reason? The more you can find out about the frog, the more you may be able to learn about yourself. We all have our secrets, some are dark. Try to figure out when you first noticed the violent behaviour, what were your feelings before killing a frog, how did you feel after killing the frog.

"I’m a man, and I’m soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but it’s been happening a lot. I don't know what to do.","Hello, and thank you for your question. When faced with these kinds of difficult challenges, I usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be. Indeed, it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we don't feel very content with our lives. Perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions: What kind of person do I want to be deep in my heart? What kind of character do I want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching? How would I want others to describe me? Let's say that you want others to see you as being authentic, and YOU also value authenticity as something you want to live by. You may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now. That you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart. This is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation. So please, try not to feel alone. We all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc. And I am not just talking about being unaccepted by others, but a person may have a VERY hard time accepting themselves. Thinking about your values and living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom, but I won't lie, it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time. For example, someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for, even if that means people may disapprove. That may cause a lot of pain, but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity. It may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy, which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them. I would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are... both as an individual and as someone's fiancé.Above all, I wish you well in this journey. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC","What do you mean by ""messing around with other men""? Are you having sex with other men and not telling your partner about it or are you telling your partner? It's possible you're confused about your orientation and sexual partner. One thing you should know is that your partner is not wrong to expect honesty about such a personal issue. It's okay to be attracted to more than one gender. As long as your feelings for your partner are genuine, that you have not lied to him, and that you are respecting the boundaries he has set with you, you can be with your current partner without hurting them. If you've already lied and crossed boundaries, you may have to consider if you really want your current partner.If you would like to know more about sexual orientation, you can read the book below:http://www.amazon.com/Your-Sexuality-Guide-Sexuality-Guide/dp/1561405485If you feel lost in this area, you may like to connect with a local LGBT center or an LGBT counselor.

   My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules. She is trying to control my life. What should I do?","That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now. The first thing to under is that you can’t change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior. The thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions.  You may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan. The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior. Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy. Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack.  There are ways you can deal with controlling parents – and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you’ll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they’re trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you’re losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust.

The most helpful way to counter a controlling parent is to try setting up the relationship as one of equal status. You can do that by telling your mom the facts: your circumstances, that you love and respect her, but don't love or respect her attempts to tell you who to date, how to dress, what career to pursue, how to drive, where to go, or when to go to sleep. You can also make sure to do the best you can to respect her wishes and take care of yourself. If your mom reacts by getting angry, try to tell her ""I'm sorry you're upset, but I just told you what I think. I cannot make you happy."" If she is open to discussing it with you, you can ask her what her feelings are and how she feels she can contribute to your happiness. Then you can consider how to respond in a way that maintains the respect you have for her and sets your boundaries.",0.4126071333885193
"I keep getting into relationships with men that are in bad situations. I take them on and help them and do all I can and the relationship still fails. How do I learn to not get in relationships with men in bad situations? I see someone in need of help, I jump in. And it is getting me nowhere. I am alone sad and frustrated.","Sounds like you already see what's amiss. You're looking for fix-er-uppers! When you meet these men they need you. And you're filled by fixing them.  And when they are fixed, what do they have to give you? What's your need in relationship? What if you found someone who didn't need fixing? ","I'm sorry to hear about your experiences. As frustrating as it must be to be in ""bad"" relationships with men who need help, I do wonder what you are getting out of it for yourself. Are you enjoying these relationships? I'm not judging you in the least - all I'm asking is you consider this question. You write that you get sad and frustrated with these relationships, but I wonder what it's like when you're in good relationships where you feel supported and appreciated. It seems you may be craving more of what you feel is lacking in those relationships, so you keep giving to the ones that are lacking. There are plenty of men who you can fall in love with and be happy and satisfied with, relationships with people who give as much or more to you as you do to them. This is the hallmark of healthy relationships, and while it's ok to help those in need, it's not ok to put yourself in a stressful, unhealthy relationship that leaves you feeling unsupported, used and unfulfilled. If you do find yourself in a bad relationship with someone, please understand that you don't deserve to be treated the way you are being treated.

"My wife and mother are having tense disagreements. In the past, they’ve had minor differences. For example, my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing; my mother would complain my wife is lazy.
 However, it’s intensified lately. I think the cause is my wife talked back to her once. Now, any little disagreement is magnified, leading to major disagreements. What can I do?","One choice is for you and your wife to decide together what are reasonable ways and expectations to have of your mother.From what you write it sounds like your wife and you have differences as to what is the proper and right way to talk with your mother.Once the both of you agree on overall philosophy and some specific details for examples, then ask your mother to make time for all three of you to discuss together the expectations and standards you and your wife would like to see happen.This is only the first step since it is possible and likely that at least on a few points, your mother will disagree and have different views.These need to be discussed and integrated into an overall plan which all three of you are happy to live with.","For a short time, just go on vacation with your mom (or mom and wife together, whichever is easiest) and not with your wife.

Being obligated is about your dad's needs.  If your dad's needs have such priority over your own that you're sacrificing your well being, it is very important for you to find someone you can talk to about this in depth. That may be your parent or a school counselor.  They can provide you with support and help you learn some assertiveness skills to let your dad know that you cannot do what he wants you to do without your well-being.  It is possible that your dad has not understood or realized how much you are suffering and that you could ask him to understand the difference between ""obligated"" and ""wanting"".",0.478809654712677
"I can't seem to feel any emotion except anxiety, not even for myself.","Empathy is the ability
to tap into our own experience to help us connect with others in order to be
aware of how they are experiencing life. 
It is a skill that we learn with practice and refine as we become mature.
If you are feeling anxious, maybe you are able to understand better others who
are going trough anxiety.  But I wonder
if instead of feeling empathy, you may just want to find ways to reduce your
anxiety.  A good idea is to be very aware
of your anxiety triggers, and once you identify them explore other ways you
could react. ¿Sera normal que no sienta empatía?Parece que no puedo experimentar ninguna otra emoción que
no sea ansiedad, ni si quiera por mí misma. Empatía es la habilidad de usar tus propias
experiencias para conectarte con otros y estar consciente de la manera que

destreza interpersonal que aprendemos y refinamos con la práctica y según maduramos
como personas.  Si te estás sintiendo
ansioso, tal vez puedas comprender mejor como otra persona experimenta momentos
de ansiedad.  Pero me pregunto si en
lugar de estar buscando sentir empatía, realmente quisieras reducir tus niveles
de ansiedad.  Una buena manera es estar consciente

pudieras tener.","Anxiety may be the result of being abused, neglected or both.

"Sometimes, I'm fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth. I've always thought it was normal and I was just nervous, but the other day, it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter Target by myself.","I would suggest keeping a log of those days when you are having a hard time. Items to write would be what were you doing before you felt this way, did you eat and what, what time of day is it, how much sleep did you get that night, etc... This can help you identify any triggers. Further assessment can be made by a health care professional. It does sound like you are experiencing some symptoms of anxiety.","Sometimes anxiety can seem like your heart is going to beat out of your chest. It can feel like you have an unquenchable thirst for water and your throat is dry as dust.

"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","It is challenging to see one's parents age and to cope with the new demands.  Your mom means a lot to you, and that is why you get easily frustrated.  I'm guessing that it is not that she is making you do work or that her expectations are non-important to you because if that were the case, you would not feel any guilt.  Accepting the new stage will help you cope with the changes.  Take a deep breath every time you feel frustrated and think of the good times you shared with your mom before her getting Alzheimer's.  Remember that your mom as she was is no longer and that she has reverted to a more delicate phase.  Also, schedule time for yourself and do things that help you relax.  Caretaking of an elderly parent can take a toll on you, and it is essential to incorporate self-care.  Finally, look for an Alzheimer's support group in your area that will help you connect with other people going through the same thing.  You are a good daughter, and your mom is lucky to have you in her life.Sincerely, Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling","This is a really difficult situation. You are very lucky that you are aware of your own emotions and able to recognize that they are not your mother's fault. This type of frustration can be really difficult. If you are able to take a few minutes to breathe through it, it can help. Also, reminding yourself why you love your mother is always a great idea. The reality is that this is a very common situation for caregivers. You can find support from friends, family and community. If your community does not offer support, there are plenty of online groups who can provide information and support. If you haven't found the time to care for your mom, now may be a good time to look into it. Depending on your mom's stage of dementia, some care from another person may be required. It can be a temporary assistance with food, hygiene or cleaning or it may be more intensive.

For me, attraction is about liking, and I think the first question to ask yourself is whether you feel you like older men in general, or if something about that particular man has you wanting a deeper connection. It's also possible that you've had older male role models growing up, who you look up to and admire, and that what you're feeling is more about wanting to be around someone like them.",0.4310488700866699

"I keep having these random thoughts that I don't want. Things like ""you aren't worth anything."" I know they're my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it.
   What is wrong with me, and how can I stop having these thoughts?","Many people have thoughts like those you describe, and often it feels like someone else is saying it because they are things that may have been said to you when you were very young.  When young children hear negative things about themselves they tend to internalize these negative ideas and to form negative core beliefs.  The good news is we can learn to stop these thoughts and to replace them with healthier thoughts.  The first step is to catch yourself when you are thinking these thoughts, and to stay ""stop!""; then replace it with another thought.  So for instance, maybe you fail a test or get rejected by a romantic interest.  You catch yourself saying ""you aren't worth anything"". Stop this thought, and replace it with ""You didn't do as well on that test as you would have liked.  Let's figure out how you can do better next time.""  Or ""she may not want to go out with you, but someone else will"".

"I'm a guy. If I don't like girls, nor do I like guys, does that mean I'm gay?","Hi, and thanks for your question. I agree with my colleagues about researching asexuality, but I want too add a couple of things about that:Here is a website that you can start with to get some information about asexuality - http://www.asexuality.org/home/There are a whole lot of myths surrounding asexuality. One is that people who are asexual have absolutely no interest in sex, and that is not always the case. There are variations of asexuality. Some people who are asexual have an interest in sex and others don't. Also, once you read more on this topic, you may find that you don't connect with asexuality either, and that is okay. Our society usually thinks of sexual orientations as only being straight, gay, lesbian, or bisexual, but the truth is there are many variations of sexual orientations. Keep exploring. There is a good chance that there is a community of people who feel like you do. Finally, labels are important for a lot of things, but labeling ourselves can sometimes lead to some painful feelings. Try not to feel pressured to label yourself too quickly. This is your journey. Your experience. Take all the time you need. You may never feel the need to label how you feel, and that is okay, too. Hope this helps. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC  ","If you are asexual your feelings are not based on attraction or lack of attraction to others. People who are asexual describe their relationship needs with others from loving to hating to not caring at all. Some are attracted to others because they love them. Asexual is about the type of relationship a person has with someone, not what that person looks like. So unless you like someone's looks I believe you are asexual or bi-sexual.",0.4319557547569275
"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years. I have been on medication, but lately my depression has felt worse. Can counseling help?","Thank you for asking this important question. I find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment. Step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change. Congratulations you did the first step! You are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question. Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression. The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with  Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events. Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression.  The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment. As counselors, we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time. However, remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well being. I hope this was helpful, and good luck with your treatment journey. ","Absolutely counseling can help. The level of detail that you have shared in your question makes it clear that you are suffering from significant depression and anxiety. Talking with a counselor will help you understand the roots of your depression and anxiety. Counseling will give you tools to cope with the symptoms of depression and anxiety. You may also discover that you have more to gain from counseling than just the symptoms.Counseling can also be effective in cases where medication has not been effective.Counseling can also address symptoms that are the result of the effects of medication.Please know that counseling is confidential, your counselor cannot disclose anything to anyone without your written permission, and your counselor is trained to help people live more fulfilling and happy lives.Counseling can take any format you would prefer such as teletherapy, in person, or in a group.",0.4799232482910156

   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","Thank you for sharing your question.  I imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session.  I would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals.  For example, a list of goals may look similar to this:1.  ""I will learn about the effects of medication on the symptoms of depression and anxiety.""2.  ""I will learn about the factors that affect insomnia.""3.  ""I will learn about resources and support groups in my local area to help me cope with my traumatic experiences.""4.  ""I will practice self-care exercises each day and write about my thoughts and feelings in a journal so I can measure whether or not I""m making progress.""This is an example of some of the possible goals a counselor can help you work toward each week.  Working toward a specific goal can lead to a feeling of accomplishment once you've completed it, and this may have a positive impact on your self-esteem.  I hope this information helps, and I wish you all the best!","Thank you for posting your question. Your questions may indicate you're already on the path to healing. I would suggest starting with a therapist who specializes in working with trauma. That doesn't mean they have to have a personal history of trauma. Trauma is understood from an expert, theoretical perspective. You may also want to consider a therapist who specializes in working with anxiety and insomnia. As you go through your healing process, you may also want to consider integrating the help of the other therapists you suggested. When I first meet a new client, I typically assess and understand their primary issues as well as the secondary ones. Once I have a clear understanding of the main focus of the therapy, I would then help you determine what secondary issues to address as well as how long it may take to feel better. I like to start therapy by developing a plan or treatment strategy. It will provide you with a plan for therapy, as well as, a guide to what will be covered in sessions.  I've worked with many people who have been traumatized, including sexual abuse. Some had additional issues with addiction or suicidal or self-harming behaviors. You can absolutely start therapy today and work through the process of healing and recovering from the multiple traumas you've experienced. I encourage you to think of therapy as a journey, not a race. Progress happens in steps. It's not about speed. The goal is to heal and recover from past events and develop healthy coping skills, new strategies, and to know when to seek outside help if needed. Keep in mind that it's never too late to heal. You don't have to suffer in silence. You deserve to feel better.  The first session is important. It gives you a chance to know whether the therapist is the right fit for you. There will be an important connection to form to help support you through the healing process. I also encourage you to seek support out from your spouse, family, friends, group therapy, spiritual community, or through internet support groups.

I think I'm running him away.","Hi Kansas,I think your first instinct was good; you broke up with him. You deserve respect, but right now you're not acting as if you deserve it when you push to see him as he's moving on with a new relationship. It's appropriate now for you to respect that relationship and listen to what he says he wants, which is space. Do you think he's going to be any different with her? This a common, unfounded fear we have. I wonder if maybe you miss the feeling of being in love and having a partner more than you miss him. The bottom line is you can't make someone love you, and you can't make someone be loving towards you, because how someone treats you (and the choices they make) has everything to do with who they are, and nothing to do with who you are.

Or perhaps his love for you is still very strong but he's fearful of being hurt again.Or it's possible that he was only using you, and he's now moving on to someone who is either more submissive to what he wants, or who simply isn't as good a match as you were.",0.4711899161338806
"My dad cheated on my mom for 13 years. I cannot stop obsessing over the fact that my boyfriend might be cheating on me even when I know he isn't. I have full access to his phone, social media, and e-mails. I never find anything, but I'm obsessed with constantly checking just in case. How do I stop this? It's driving a wedge between us.","Hi Greenville, I respect that you're owning your own overreactions, and that you want to give your boyfriend the respect he deserves. The truth is that some people cheat, and some don't, and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they can't be trusted.The answer here is in two different areas. Basically, if you want to feel differently (more trusting, in your case), you look at your thoughts, and your behaviours.Your thoughts are stuck... like tires in deep ruts in the road. These thoughts are only habits, they don't reflect the truth. Fear is probably whispering in your ear things like ""everyone cheats"", or "" you're not enough for him"". Once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you, picture those words in red next time they come up. Ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought (there won't be much...perhaps none), and what is the evidence that doesn't support it (I know lots of good men, I know I deserve love and loyalty, there is no sign of infidelity...). You're learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear. That's the first half. Practise these thoughts.The rest of the work is in your behaviours. Act as though you trust him. Force yourself to not check or interrogate, and the less you check, the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel. Acting ""as if"" something if true strangely helps us believe it.It's possible to change the way we think, and this is turn changes the way we feel. Try this to start, and see a therapist for support and cognitive behavioural therapy if you want to dive more deeply into why this is happening and how to stop it. Good luck!","One reason you're obsessing might be because there is a part of you that feels betrayed by your Dad and that you want what you lost to be regained. Since you don't have that option, it's likely that part of you is trying to get something it wants, i.e. your Dad's trust, back. If you were to know that you were doing this as an attempt to regain lost trust, you might have the sense that this is no way to get that back, given that cheating would damage your relationship with him. In addition, there are likely messages from your mother she gives you in the form of her telling you how much she loves you and how important you are to her, which must be taken into account in order to stop obsessing. A good counselor will be able to help you explore this.  It sounds like you are missing the important message you should be receiving from your mother and that is that whatever your relationship is with your dad, is separate and not reflective of how she feels about you.  So, let go of the idea that you are a bad person because you're going through this.  It's hard to let go of the idea that you're a bad person if someone has used the word, 'betrayal', to describe what your Dad did to your mom. Remember, you are a good person and deserve someone who will treat you the way you are deserving.

Sounds to me like you are being treated more like a child than an adult.  It's time to learn about healthy boundaries and being treated like an adult. This process will take time, but beyond elevating your self-esteem and worth, you will be modeling to your children a healthy adult. Model to them an empowered, confident, and person that is worthy of respect. Please invest in yourself. Find yourself a therapist that encourages and empowers you to have a voice and not feel invisible. You'll be so glad you did!","Hi,First, you're not trapped and you do have a voice in the relationship with your parents and you can say ""No, I don't want to listen to insults"". You can also try to understand your parents' emotions before telling them how their words are hurting you. They may not realize how hurtful their words are. After you have tried to listen and understand their reasons for being verbally abusive, it is important for you to stand firm and tell them you are done with the abuse. Also, be prepared that your parents may not listen to you, even if you are speaking the truth. I also suggest seeking assistance in dealing with a family member and the abusive behaviors. Sometimes families need help in order to resolve unhealthy patterns of behaving. If you need some immediate help in feeling less stressed due to dealing with your parents' verbal abuse, I suggest taking a good care of yourself. Try to get some rest, eat healthy and stay active physically and emotionally. I hope this will help.",0.5354005694389343
What makes a healthy marriage last?,"In my mind, a healthy marriage has two participants, meaning both people participate equally in the intimate connection of marriage. An unequal participation comes in many forms, such as one person checking out of conversations when it becomes emotional, or speaking over and for each other in these conversations. Couple’s should strive for engagement and support, but doing it in a way that works for each person individually. I hope this helps.","What makes a healthy marriage last is a complex question, as are many matters in life. Many aspects of a marriage are up to the couple to establish the definition of what makes a ""good marriage."" It's a two-way street and we only know what we know based on our life's experience. That being said, many aspects are not that difficult or complicated to establish:     1. Communication is Key! This sounds like a basic, ""textbook"" answer. However, you need to actually develop the skills of listening to your partner and really wanting to understand their view of things, as well as sharing your feelings and view.   2. Acceptance, Understanding and Respect: These 3 are a good starting point. Can you accept your partner as they are? Can you understand their point of view and their needs and want to listen to them? Can you respect their boundaries and differences?   3. Respect - Again, so important. Each of you needs to see the value and worth in your partner's contribution to the relationship.  4. Conflict Resolution. Learn the way that you and your partner each handle conflict. This may be quite different from each other.   5. Intimacy. This also includes emotional, physical, intellectual and sexual intimacy. I know sometimes it's hard to share your inner self with your partner (emotional) and sometimes this feels awkward. And it should be. It doesn't mean you're not emotionally available or comfortable. This simply means you have a new side of yourself to be vulnerable with. I've had great luck when I work with couples and help them open up. This creates intimacy and helps them to better understand and connect with each other.",0.5080770254135132
"I know that I need to get past my feelings for this person I fell in love with, but t's so difficult to move on because he showed me feelings I've never felt before. 

I feel like I don't  want to be without my genuine love for him, but logically, I know I need to be without him. I can't discuss this with anybody in my life because the conditions surrounding our love are considered  ""wrong"" by a lot of people.

How can I get myself to just move on?","It's difficult to move on and let go, especially when you've experienced things for the first time with someone, or feelings you've never felt before, as you said.I like the fact that you are looking at your situation ""logically"".  Feelings can take time to fade, but you seem to understand, even if it is subconsciously, that it's the feelings he stirred up in you that are keeping you tied to him, not necessarily the person himself. Realize that you can and will experience those feelings again with another person - the RIGHT person. Don't hold onto someone who is wrong for you just because of something like this. You're wanting those feelings and wanting a relationship - but with him necessarily? Or with anybody? You said you don't want to be without your love for him - not you don't want to be without him. In fact, you said you know you need to be without him. It seems like it's the LOVE that you can't let go of, and the feelings. Not the person. Trust me, you will find that again. Take some time to let this fade. Don't try to force him or anyone else into a role that is meant for someone else. Cherish the memories and the experiences you had. Sounds like it's been a valuable learning and growth experience for you, but you have your own reasons, and I don't know what they are, for thinking this person isn't good for you. Trust your gut instinct and be glad you've had this relationship. Not all are meant to last. But all shape you into the person you are and will become, and all teach us important lessons.","You don't have to ""just move on."" Moving on happens when you feel ready. I'm sorry that you lost this relationship due to the circumstances surrounding it. While I am sure it was painful for you, it sounds like it was also something that you thought of as not right. It is understandable that you need to move on because you realize it wasn't right, rather than because you don't want to be without him.  You don't have to love without him to be willing to let go.",0.49146223068237305
"I have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and I just had my first kiss five months ago. I’m worried that, at this rate, I won’t have a boyfriend for a very long time. The problem is that I want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, I don't want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex. I have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. Luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. I feel dirty by doing this, but I feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal.

Most people are surprised when they find out that I am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think I am really good looking. I am tall, I play lots of sports, and I get excellent grades in school. I am in my first year of university right now, and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest. It bothers me. Most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already. I feel like I will be single forever sometimes.","I think that every person who has been single for any extended period of time has felt the same worries - myself included. Since relationships are so important to us we fear not having them and being single. It is similar to fearing that we won't ever get a good job when we have been out of work for awhile or fearing that we won't be healthy when we have been sick. We fear these things because they are so important - not because these fears are realistic or true! There is immense pressure put on young single people from peers and media to conform to ideas of what is normal and to meet expectations in terms of sexual experience, dating, etc. While some people may judge an adult who is a virgin - others will respect your choices and feel even more attracted to you because of your choices. Experimenting with sex, so long as you are being safe and respectful is also completely okay and normal. Since expectations vary and we can't be happy if we are always comparing ourselves to other people, we need to ultimately trust that being who we are and building a loving relationship with ourselves is the key to meeting someone who will cherish us for all the ways that we are special and unique, virgin or not. When we are able to really accept ourselves and trust in our loveableness (not a real word but you get what I mean!) then meeting someone special is simply a matter of time and effort - putting ourselves out in the world in situations where we are likely to meet other single people looking for relationships. When you are most afraid of being alone - remember that this fear is simply a reminder of how much you value relationships. Use that passion about wanting relationships to build the best relationship you can with yourself and then one day soon some lucky person will stumble into your life and benefit immensely from your passion and your ability to be authentically who you are rather than pretending to be ""normal"" or whatever that is anyway. Hope this helps! ","Hi St. Louis, Thank you for sharing. I think everyone has questions or feels concerned about when they will have their first experience. What you write about is not uncommon. So many factors go into our intimacy relationships, from birth and development, family, religion, cultural backgrounds and our own internal factors. Your self-loathing sounds a bit like your feeling of anxiety. Try to stop being so hard on yourself - there is no time limit set by you that says you will not have a partner. Have a good relationship with yourself, like a good friend and it helps. My suggestion for you is to stop hooking up with random strangers. This is a choice you need to make and you did it, now you can focus on what you can change. It sounds like you know who you are not happy about. And you do not need to rush into having sex with someone else in order to feel whole. There are plenty of good people, you will attract people who value you and who are attracted to you. If they ask about being a virgin or not, they will be willing to wait and see if that is of importance to you. You do not need to be like your family so much. All you can do is be you. Best of luck to you in your journey.",0.3623217046260834
"The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headaches—mostly mouth breathing and snoring. It makes me angry, and I want to solve it myself.","Probably good to know in what type of situations you are, in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoring.If you're sleeping beside your partner who does these actions, would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchen.Basically, if the person who does these actions which bother you, start by telling them.Depending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds, or not, willing to change, or not, has a good deal to do with next steps.I don't really see any step you're able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the head.One path I don't recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered, or dismissing your own sensitivity someone.Your needs matter.","It's common for a sound to evoke an emotional response or reaction.  The relationship that you have with your partner regarding this issue has to be considered in your request.  In the absence of this information, here's my attempt at giving you some things to try.  Your partner probably already knows what your reaction is to the noises and maybe they can help you determine if they are able to help or not.  They may have tried several things already with no results.  If your partner makes the noise on their own, then it's probably something they are experiencing.  What if you try listening to the sounds that you describe and attempt to determine what is going through your mind when you hear them?  Could you possibly focus on your emotions regarding the way that your partner is breathing and what may be causing it?  Perhaps there is an underlying problem that is triggering an emotional response.  Or perhaps the noise is a symptom of an underlying issue such as a sleep disorder.  Also, when we are feeling stressed or anxious, we may actually breathe more often or shallowly which may cause the sounds you describe.  Try practicing some relaxation exercises, such as meditation.  If you are having an emotional reaction related to this, then try practicing some emotional regulation skills.  If you are having an emotion that is overwhelming for you to handle, then consider seeing a therapist or counselor who can help you with this.  There are many online options for online counseling.  My favorite website for finding a counselor is found here:  www.psychologytoday.com",0.41436225175857544
I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.,"First I think we have to acknowledge that you are doing something amazing.  You are putting yourself out there and becoming a Water Safety Instructor.   We often times will focus on the negative and forget about the positive.  Next, you had an incident where someone pointed something out which may have caused embarrassment.  Whether or not it was malicious on his part I think the important thing to focus on is what is called ""Common Humanity"".  Common Humanity is one of the three elements of self-compassion.  Common humanity essentially recognizes that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the shared human experience.  While you may have had this embarrassing moment at this time, that boy may have had an embarrassing moment another day.  We all have embarrassing moments.  When we recognize that we do not suffer in isolation then we are able to move past that suffering.  Additionally another element to self-compassion is self-kindness.  My question is why must you forgive yourself?  Rather, be kind to yourself for learning an amazing new talent.","Are your friends who you mentioned telling your situation to supportive? As a rule, I would not go against your own ethical code and expect your buddies to cover for you. Your own sense of ethics and boundaries are the one area in which you should have no issues with your behavior.  In a situation like this, I would trust your own judgment.  As far as your other question...I do think that a lot of boys might be judgmental of you based on your attire.  Is there anything you can do to improve this other than the action of covering yourself with a shirt?  The simple answer is that if you are comfortable then it is up to you to decide what you are going to wear.    You need to decide what kind of ""signal"" you are going to send to others.  Be honest with yourself.  You do not have to make friends with everyone who sees you.  You have to make friends with those you feel comfortable with.  If they don't judge you, then you don't have to worry about what they are thinking or saying about your clothing.  There is no way to make everyone like you, but I bet you can make a handful of friends that like you.  Try not to worry so much about making the wrong impression on other people.  People are judgemental of each other and you probably already are aware of that.  Concentrate on not worrying about being judged.  The fewer people who are judging you, the more you will have friends.    The point of getting the certificate is that it will allow you to teach other people how to swim and be safe in the water.  Think of how proud you will feel when you successfully teach someone to swim.  And, what is worse that somebody judging your swimsuit?  That is the point of the certificate, you do not need to impress people with your clothing.  I would like to encourage you to focus on your swimming skills, so you are able to swim well in the water, that is your focus.",0.4216376543045044

"My mother is combative with me when I say I don't want to talk with her about my depression.  

She hasn't been supportive of me in the past and she isn't someone that I feel comfortable opening up to. She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I don't want to or can't answer. I tell her I don't want to talk and she starts arguments with me. 

How can I get her to understand?","Your situation sounds extremely frustrating.You're doing the right move to state you don't want to discuss your depression with her.I guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression.  If you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation, and you would like to tell her your true reason, then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time, not in the middle of an argument.Having an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept.  You may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this.","The answer to this question is that you simply cannot get her to understand your position.It sounds like you've experienced a history in which your mom hasn't been supportive, and based on your experience, your mom will not change.One possible approach is to simply recognize what you know about your mom, and let go of the expectation that she will change.Your experience tells you how she treats you. You do not have the power to change her experience. The only person that can change her experience, is your mom. And so you can't change her. I wonder whether your mother expects some kind of apology from you for you being unsupportive (if you have not been supportive), or if she's holding out hope that you will be supportive in the future.It may be possible to say to your mother, ""I understand that you are concerned about me, and I want you to know that, but I don't feel comfortable talking to you about this right now."" If you've said that many times, then it is not likely to change her behavior.Once you accept her reality, you can simply decide how to respond if she initiates a discussion about your depression. Do you want to engage in a discussion? If so, what do you say? If not, you simply say that you don't want to talk.",0.489837646484375
"Over the years, I have slowly lost everything: my jobs, my cars, my freedom, and my money. I am a stay-at-home mom who doesn't make any money, doesn't have a car, never goes out, and cleans all day long everyday.","There are an infinite number of possibilities here. You included a lot of things that you don't have. Is there anyway that you can have some freedom for a few hours a week, at least? A lot of times stay at home moms have groups when they meet at different public places where their children can play together and they can talk together. I don't know how old your child or children is/are, but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the future.I wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you. I don't know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things. I wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted? If you can sort out some possible answers to that, maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happen.Also, again depending on the age of your children, some parents can do things while the children are sleeping, even if you are in the same room. For example, if your children are sleeping for about two hours, maybe 30 minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do.","It sounds like you have hit some big hurdles in your life and right now it feels pretty bleak and hopeless. One of the things I hear clients tell me is that they blame themselves for where they are in life but when we look at the picture as a whole, there are many things outside of their control. It is a good first step to realize you are not to blame. This is a tough situation to be in and getting support for it is important. Does your family know you need support? Do you have friends that you can talk to? Do you have a good relationship with your partner and your kids? When we feel depressed, depression can mess with our relationships with the ones we love the most. Rebuilding trust with people is also a part of the healing process. Are you able to stay connected to your partner and your kids? Therapy might be a good idea to help you address some of these challenges. It is possible to get back on track, but it may take some time and effort to get there. If things are feeling too difficult, please reach out. There are plenty of people willing to give you a hand. The road to recovery might be rough, but I have seen many people get back to where they want to be.

My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules. She is trying to control my life. What should I do?","That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now.  The first thing to under is that you can’t change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior.  The thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions.  You may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan. The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior.  Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy.  Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack.  There are ways you can deal with controlling parents – and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you’ll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they’re trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you’re losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust.

Your mother can offer advice, but ultimately the decision is yours.If your parents are supportive and you can talk things through, that's the best possible outcome. If that doesn't work, then what to do next depends on the specifics of your situation.  You could explore alternatives such as another family member, a friend, a counselor, or a local social services organization.  This is something you need to decide on how best to handle in a way that maintains a good relationship with your mother if you're able to.

Why is it so important for you to say that Santa is real? If it's because you really really love the magic of Christmas then you probably don't want to ruin it for your kids. And you have the right to decide what kind of Christmas experience you have with your kids.  2. You have a great chance to discuss with your kids this Christmas about the meaning of Christmas and how it can be special by having traditions that are not linked to magic. I can see this being a great learning experience for your kids.  3. Tell your kids the truth about Santa, but tell them in your own words, in a way that doesn't completely ruin the magic of Christmas, since this is important to them. 4. It's possible your kids just want to feel loved and special. Let them know how much you love them and how special they are. Maybe you can also bring up a tradition that is unique to you that gives you and your children a magical experience.  5. It's possible that your kids want to feel loved and feel special in order to keep feeling loved by your ex. In that case, your ex would need to talk with your kids about Santa, too.

I need help knowing how to deal with stress.

Check out meditation apps such as 'Breathe', which can talk you through a relaxing breath exercise.

However, make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them. On the other hand, if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded, it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship. Not all friendships are healthy ones. And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it.I hope you are able to get this matter sorted. Best of luck!","I often think of the definition of hypocrisy as: The fact of one's actions contradicting one's espoused or professed political beliefs or religious principles. It's also sometimes defined as behaving in a way that is the opposite of what one teaches. If the people you are referring to are your family members, who love you, then I would say that their actions were never intended to hurt you and it sounds like they are feeling justified in their accusations because they feel like your actions contradict what they believe or feel is right. It sounds like you may need to have an honest conversation with them about what you feel. In doing so, you should focus on how you feel rather than criticizing them. You can ask them to listen to you describe what you feel and then explain how you would like for them to communicate with you in the future. It's important to remember that you don't have to justify your actions and you don't have to be right. You are simply asking to communicate with them in a way that is healthy. As far as the term ""baby,"" I would avoid trying to justify that word. That is your family's term and not the appropriate one for you to use in response. Best of luck to you.",0.4612034559249878
"I empathize so much, even with characters on tv or in video games, that I actually feel physical pain. This has made life difficult to say the least.

I believe I have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder. But since it's such a new disorder I can't find any information about it. Could this be what is going on with me?","The world needs more people lately who have such a high degree of empathy which you describe in yourself!If it feels a little burdensome, then look to balance what is too much with its opposite.  Since you're giving a lot of empathy, maybe you'd like receiving a lot of empathy.In the situation you describe, when you start empathizing with others, real or cartoon, ask yourself whether you've felt empathy coming in your direction lately.Often people give to others what they feel within themselves is missing.The emotional brain reasons that if I give you my support, say, then at least I will feel half of what being supported is like.Obviously the wish to receive more empathy cannot be fulfilled by you directly.  Empathy is delivered by someone who is willing to offer it.Reflect on whether you are allowing those who are in your world, to know when you would like to receive their empathy.Is it possible you keep your feelings to yourself and present as though you are able to handle a great deal more than you'd like to handle without anyone's kindness to support you?Being open to others about your own inner thoughts and feelings is much more difficult than it sounds.It sounds easy to just tell someone how you feel.Sometimes the first step is the most difficult, of accessing how you feel.Start with knowing the amount of empathy you'd like from others and what stops you from asking.Also, about your diagnosis and the lack of  studies and lists and formulas.  Each person is unique, the instructions and guidelines don't necessarily mean very much.  Often having a diagnosis makes a person feel weak, stigmatized, incompetent. Forget the diagnosis and concentrate on what you need to do differently in order to feel better.The answers are inside you, not inside a book or website.","Please ask your doctor to write a referral to a psychiatrist or therapist experienced in working with these kinds of issues.

"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","It is normal to feel an array of emotions in therapy. Most people use therapy as a way to process their life's struggles and often times this results in them crying during session. Crying is a way to release those negative emotions and to cope with what is happening in life. We have come to believe that crying is something bad at times and so have conditioned ourselves to avoid crying out in public places. In therapy though, where there are no such expectations and where you can be open and honest about how you are feeling it is normal to cry.",Everyone can cry during therapy. The important thing to realize is that the therapy process is about you and not about trying to impress your therapist. There is no 'normal' way to cry in therapy. Crying is an entirely natural and normal process which anyone can go through at any time in any therapy session.  Sometimes it helps people feel safer to let their true feelings out.  Letting yourself be vulnerable and honest with your therapist may sometimes even help some people to feel more relaxed and open and may even be helpful in terms of the outcomes of therapy.,0.559555172920227
"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","When talking about difficult issues, it is very normal to cry. Crying is a natural way for us to cope with the sadness that we experience in life. When confronting some of these things in a counseling session, tears just seem to come naturally. Every Counselor should be well equipped to handle that level of emotion, and you would be far from the first to cry when talking with a Counselor.","Not at all! I have never had a client ever cry in my office, not once. It's perfectly okay to cry, even in therapy. Crying is a natural and healthy way of letting out built up feelings that may even be emotions which has been long buried. Crying in therapy will not make you seem any less competent or vulnerable.  In fact, it will probably give you a sense of relief to finally let out the tears and truly let yourself be comfortable with all the emotions that are in you and in you feeling overwhelmed. And if you feel embarrassed when you cry, the therapist will be very understanding of what you are going through and will reassure you that it's okay.

"I have a lot on my mind, but all I want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone. Why do I feel so alone?","There are many possible issues to consider as depression  social anxieties, even medical illness.  For some, even grief creates a sense of isolation, pains from relationship break up.  Also, obsessive thinking can be debilitating.  Seeking at least one trusted friend or family member can be a start towards increased personal support.  Some persons may simply feel connected by spending time with someone as this, even if not talking directly on issues, just being around another is positive.  Obviously there is more to explore on this question, given minimal information from two sentences.","This feeling, of being lonely, can feel quite intense and overwhelming sometimes, because it is at the core of our social and emotional needs. It is essential for us to feel loved and connected to others to be psychologically healthy. I know that for some people, when feeling lonely and not wanting to socialize, it can be difficult to take that first step and reach out for help. Perhaps there is a part of you that feels disappointed or guilty about it, or maybe you are afraid of rejection. Perhaps a part of you is just scared to put yourself out there. Maybe you fear not being understood or liked. We all have these types of fears and they can sometimes get in the way of us reaching out for help. First and foremost, please remember that if you reach out for help and are not understood, this is not your fault at all. I encourage you to practice self-compassion and self-care in this case. If you are able to practice self-compassion and self-care, it can actually help you to take that first step. In a relationship with a competent therapist, you can learn to explore your feelings of loneliness and discover any thoughts that contribute to it. This will allow you to find ways to ease those feelings and reach out to others with self-compassion. There are also wonderful resources online for this.

My mother is combative with me when I say I don't want to talk with her about my depression.    She hasn't been supportive of me in the past and she isn't someone that I feel comfortable opening up to. She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I don't want to or can't answer. I tell her I don't want to talk and she starts arguments with me.    How can I get her to understand?,"Your situation sounds extremely frustrating.You're doing the right move to state you don't want to discuss your depression with her.I guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression.  If you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation, and you would like to tell her your true reason, then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time, not in the middle of an argument.Having an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept.  You may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this.","Its ok if you don't want to talk to your mom, you need to honor that.You may need to learn how to set boundaries in an assertive way. This means saying no and respecting your decision when she isn't honoring your boundaries. You can practice assertive communication by having a conversation with someone who you trust and who respects your boundaries. You may need to seek help from a therapist to do this on your own, if this is something that you are concerned about. This type of situation may be more complex. Would you say to her that you aren't going to talk about ""your depression"" with her?

I am a survivor of multiple sexual abuse/rape experiences. Triggers are having an effect on my daily life and my sexual relationship with my partner. I'm trying to learn to cope with them.,"I'm glad you're willing to keep optimistic about life improving and offering better relationships than some of the ones in which you greatly suffered.One suggestion is to develop patience with yourself and the process of regaining your willingness to trust other people.Sexual intimacy engages all of who we truly are.   Being cautious as to who and how much you allow someone into your life, is natural for anyone recovering from trauma.Allow yourself to withdraw when situations feel dangerous.   Your sense of danger is most likely on higher alert than had you not been victimized.Be attentive and cooperate with your own sense of readiness to engage in conversation, discussions and sex with your partner.Explain all this to your partner so the person can develop their own patience with your recuperation process.",If you are still getting triggered every day then its important to find an experienced counselor. A therapist who has expertise in trauma therapy like EMDR or somatic experiencing will be able to assist you in processing your experiences. One way to deal with triggers is to develop some coping mechanisms. If you are with a partner who is aware and supportive you may try some of these. Grounding exercises work well for some people and you may want to try doing a quick scan for your body and if you find tension you may try to relax those muscles or take a few deep breaths. Being in the moment helps you learn to separate from the flashback. Another option is to develop a script that you can use when you feel like you are getting triggered. You don't have to do this alone. You can reach out to me for a session.,0.4072497487068176
How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"To be able to identify a clear ending to a counseling relationship, we must have a clear understanding of the goals and limitations of treatment.  Usually, during the initial evaluation, I identify my client’s short term and long term therapy goals.  As therapy progress, we verify goals on a monthly to a quarterly basis, depending on the frequency of the appointments.  Once the therapy goals have been met, there is a closing session, the counseling relationship is ended, and the client can stop attending sessions.  In some cases, the client can also establish new goals and determine if I am a good fit for their therapy needs or if they need a new provider, in which case I provide multiple referrals.The counseling relationship could also end due to other factors like noncompliance= when a client is not committed to the agreed treatment process, or when the client’s or a counselor violates the counseling relationship.  Either the counselor or the client is able to end counseling.  Although, as mental health providers we need to provide a reason for terminating our therapeutic relationship and referral options, as a client no explanation is needed, a closing session is highly recommended.  ¿Cómo termina la terapia?¿Cómo un consejero decide cuando terminar las sesiones de consejería o terminar de trabajar con un paciente?Para poder determinar el final de la relación del consejero, debemos comprender las metas y parámetros de la terapia.  Usualmente durante la evaluación inicial se identifican metas a corto y largo plazo con el cliente, y se discute con el cliente como esas metas serán alcanzadas.  Durante el proceso de terapia el consejero revisa las metas mensual o trimestralmente dependiendo de la frecuencia de las citas.  Ya que las metas de terapia son alcanzadas, hay una sesión de cierre y el cliente puede terminar la terapia.   En algunos casos el cliente puede identificar nuevas metas para la terapia y determinar si el mismo consejero u otro consejero le pueden asistir. 
La relación de consejería también puede terminar por no conformar o violentar los parámetros  establecidos para la terapia.   Tanto el consejero como el cliente pueden terminar la relación de terapia.  Como proveedores de salud mental los consejeros estamos obligados a proveer un razón para la conclusión del tratamiento y proveer referidos según aplique, los clientes no necesitan proveer una explicación, aunque es recomendable discutirlo en una sesión de cierre.","This is a complicated question because the decision is very dependent on a number of factors - things we've discussed during sessions, and your goals for therapy, but also your personality traits.  I'll try to answer this as openly as possible.Counselors, like any of us, end therapy when they no longer think they are the best therapist for the job. Sometimes this is by choice, sometimes it is something else, like the client is done. For me, the ""end"" is often when the client is as ready as they will ever be to complete therapy and continue to move on with their life.Sometimes it's obvious, if the clients goals are achieved, they're done. However, sometimes the answer is much more messy than that.It really all depends on the client.  Some clients want to be done, and they don't know how to tell me. Others have an idea of what they want to achieve in therapy, but it just doesn't happen. Some clients just enjoy talking to me or simply enjoy therapy for it's own sake. I'll admit that sometimes I enjoy it too.  In my case, I often just set a ""next session"" date, and know I'll be done in that one because I know that's the end of it, even if it wasn't planned.You, as the client, need to know whether you are looking for long-term therapy or short-term therapy.  Some therapists will only see clients for a specific amount of time, say five sessions, others will see clients for life. And some fall somewhere in between. You need to be able to ask these kinds of questions before you start counseling. And remember, it is okay to change your mind! Sometimes you'll start counseling and realize you aren't happy with the therapist or the process.It's also important to remember, from time to time it is important to take a step back from counseling, and do something different. A new therapist may be exactly what you need.",0.2891696095466614
I was born a girl. I look like a boy. I sometimes feel like a different variation of gender. I don't know what to say if someone asks my gender. I just get really confused and usually say my birth gender.,"I agree with Sherry, it is OK to give the answer that you feel most familiar with.  The most important part is not who people think you are, but that you know who you are.  Read about gender identity and fluidity.  Discovering the answer is a process, don't rush it to comply with others either way.  If you feel that this is a constant issue that keeps you awake and keeps you from enjoying your life, consider going to a therapist to discuss your feelings and concerns. ¿Qué significa que yo me sienta como diferentes géneros?Nací como niña. Me veo como niño.  A veces siento como una variación diferente de género.  No sé qué decirle a otros cuando pregunta que soy.  Me siento confuso y solo digo mi genero de nacimiento. Estoy de acuerdo con Sherry, está bien dar la respuesta que se sienta más cómoda.  La parte más importante no es quien las otras personas piensen que eres, sino quien tú piensas que eres.  Lee sobre el tema de identidad de género y fluidez de género.  Descubrir tu género puede ser un proceso, no lo apresures para complacer a otras personas.  Si sientes que este tema te esta quitando el sueno y te impide disfrutar tu vida, habla con tu consejero sobre tus sentimientos y preocupaciones.","There is no right answer for what you say in the conversation.  Your first choice should be to decide what you are comfortable with! You have a few choices:  If you are not sure of your gender, you can tell them that. If you wish to be called the gender you are most of the time, then use the terms that correspond with this.If you are unsure of what your gender is, you might choose to use terms like gender fluid, genderqueer, nonbinary or many others.They may be unfamiliar. You can even say something like ""I'm not sure how to describe myself and I'm not sure what you want to know"". I think most people will be able to relate to this idea of not knowing your own gender.You can even ask them what they want to know so you can answer it yourself.Then, there's always the possibility of simply saying you are a girl and if they ask again, tell them you don't know.",0.23453468084335327
"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","Therapy is by nature a safe place to discuss difficult, or painful memories or experiences and thereby it is normal that feelings of all kinds, including sadness, loss, frustration, disappointment, etc may arise.  This is part of processing and bringing closure to things that may have been pushed aside for a lifetime and can now be faced and dealt with.  Change too is often not easy, and can lead to crying, whether from frustration and set back...or also from joy and accomplishment!","Crying during therapy is normal. It can be uncomfortable and may make you feel vulnerable or very raw. If you are crying, you are very present in your emotions and are not holding anything back during that time.  It is a good thing. You are expressing your experience of the moment.    It sounds like you're having an emotional experience of therapy that has you wanting to break down. I suggest that you let your therapist know that so that you're open to exploring that emotion with her/him, as often the greatest discoveries, like that which is present in tears, are in our most vulnerable moments.",0.5048702359199524

I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.,"Sometimes we make ourselves feel worse with our own thoughts about things we can't change. We know that it is possible to overcome embarrassment and self-blame, but why does it seem so difficult to overcome it sometimes? If you tune into your own thoughts, or your ""internal dialogue"", you'll notice that your thoughts are connected to your feelings. So people who are holding onto embarrassment and self-blame often have thoughts like, ""How could I do that?"", ""I looked so stupid!"" ""Now people saw things I did not want them to see!"" If we tune in more, we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible, horrible, and that we cannot deal with it. These are self-sabotaging thoughts that lead to shame, self-blame and embarrassment. If you look at the evidence, you can find more rational thoughts such as, "" We all make mistakes"", ""People can look all different ways at different time - this incident does not define me!"" and ""If someone has a bad image or thought about me, it is really OK! People have all kinds of thoughts about other people, and it does not have to be a major problem."" When you practice your rational thoughts often and replace the negative ones, you will start to feel better, more confident and your embarrassment will decrease quickly.","Your embarrassment may subside over time, or it may just become a part of your personality and shape how you view your body. I'm not sure how old you are, so I can't comment on your stage of development, but often teens, especially girls, put themselves down because they feel insecure about themselves, about who they are as a person and how they see themselves physically.

"My fiancé doesn't think I trust him because I was cheated on before. However, he hides his phone and has been texting his ex-girlfriend, who he has two kids with. What should I do?","Oh Chino, I only have half the picture here so I will be cautious. There's a chicken and an egg, and I don't know which came first. One thing I see clearly is that your fiance will always have to have communications with his ex, because they have children. Can you accept that? When suspicion and insecurity come along, your job is to look at the big picture and the real picture. Is there any real evidence that he is cheating? Remember that texting his ex is not evidence alone if the communications are about the kids. Has he earned your trust? If so, then it's not fair to punish him for the betrayals of others. He's not your ex. Reassure your heart that you are his priority if the larger evidence supports that. At the same time, you can let him know what your triggers are. For example, hiding his phone doesn't send you a good message, right? See, this is the chicken and the egg...is he hiding the phone because you've been overreacting when he gets a text?  So let him know you won't blow up about him getting a text if he doesn't conceal or password his phone. Transparency helps build trust. You have sensitivities, and it helps you a lot if he's aware of them and willing to try not to do things that trigger fear. Let him know when you get scared, and hopefully he'll give you the openness and security you need in order to trust him and act as if you trust him.  :)","If you do not trust your fiancé, is this something you need to address and discuss with him, or do you think that the issue will resolve in time.  If it is something that you do not need to discuss, then you may need to consider if you are willing to accept these behaviors from him, given that you do not know what you will do.  When a couple is in conflict, is can be difficult to understand where to go for help.  If you are in an abusive relationship or if you need help with making important life decisions, there are hotlines you can reach out to for help such as domestic violence hotlines and/or national suicide hotlines.  If you do not feel you are in an abusive relationship, contact your local domestic violence hotline for counseling and referrals for local therapists.",0.4346134662628174
I just wanted to get to know one so I can hear about their college experience and the courses they took. I also wanted to know if they enjoy their job and how long they were in school.,"It's a great idea for you to reach out to find a psychologist to talk to if this is a field you might be interested in pursuing. Regarding the length of schooling, it generally takes 4 years of college and an additional 4 to 7 years of graduate school to earn a doctorate degree to become a psychologist. There are also other similar professions, including counseling that don't require a doctorate degree. Licensed counselors generally completed 4 years of college and an additional 2 years of graduate school. If you are thinking about a career in psychology, the local APA chapter would be a good place to start to find a local psychologist to talk to. Here's a link to the NJ APA chapter:https://www.psychologynj.org/","First, remember that every nursing school is different. Many instructors and students like to have a more ""hands on"" approach to learning, some prefer more lecture based courses. Many nursing schools will tell you a little more information about the clinical sites and the kinds of experiences you will have. If your nursing school is more about lectures and clinicals then I would recommend looking into the program catalog online, or reaching out to the nurse practitioner, or doctor, and learning more about their practice. You may find a class that you'd be interested in taking from them (especially on clinicals) and that might be your best way to get to know them and learn more about their experiences.Also, your school may have a nurse practitioner or doctor who serves as a mentor and is available to talk to you about your experiences and future goals.",0.5045636296272278

At this early stage, this is a bit of a warning sign. If he can't accept or feel comfortable with who you are and decisions you've made, there's already a level of discomfort here that shouldn't be ignored. No, he doesn't have the right to penalize you or punish you ...not just for past things...not for anything. What he does get to do it tell you how it affects him. Sure...if he feels uncomfortable or needs reassurance...listen to those things. But If he doesn't dig who you are, maybe he can walk the other way.","While it’s normal for us to be upset when we’ve been hurt by someone we cared about, it's not okay for him to penalize you for things you did “before you met him.” The point is not to punish you, but to be with someone who is willing to work through the past and grow as a couple. If your boyfriend's past relationship still causes him to be angry, he may need professional help to manage it.

"My roommate has had a drinking problem for a while. She goes out, gets trashed, and then expects everyone to take care of her. The next morning, she apologizes constantly until she feels validated. She also thinks everyone hates her all the time. If I don't seem anything other than happy, she asks me ""Do you hate me? You hate me. Tell me you love me,"" and I feel like I have to pity her because she has also been suicidal before.","It does sound like your roommate may have a drinking problem, and the short answer is that you can't do anything about it, only she can. We can't change what other people say, think, or do. We can only change our reactions. It does sound like your roommate may be having a hard time. You can suggest that she enter counseling or therapy. You can reassure her that you like her (if that's true), but you don't have to pity her.","I would guess you feel obligated to take care of her. That must be very stressful. There must be reasons for her drinking aside from simply enjoying it. What makes you think she is suicidal? I would encourage you to find out the real reasons for her drinking.  Alcohol is sometimes used to deal with difficult life circumstances. That's a really complex issue to navigate. What I'm wondering, is how close you have to be to her? I'd also imagine the fact that she's been depressed is a big part of this equation. Perhaps you can understand why she drinks so that you don't feel as though it is your duty to take care of her. If you are able to empathize with her current struggle, you may find that your role as roommate becomes less difficult. If you do not wish to be close to your roommate, there are some things you may do to limit your interaction with her. Perhaps you can find a friend to have conversations with, or an occasional activity to do together. There are places to go alone, even if that means a new place. I agree with Sarah, you have not specified your relationship to her, so this response may be different if you are a parent. It sounds like you need help coping with the stress of living in the same house as someone who is drinking.

"After first meeting the client, what is the process that a counselor facilitates?","Hi.  This is an excellent question !   I think that the answer probably varies depending upon the particular therapist .  In my work with people , once we have met and I have gotten an idea of the person'a concerns and the issues they want help with , I spend the next few sessions gathering as much history and as much information about the client's current concerns in order to formulate some ideas about what may be causing distress .  I would then share my thoughts with the client to see if they feel I am understanding them and on the right track.  We would then discuss the best plan to address the client's concerns .  Usually I will suggest strategies that I think may be helpful and ask the client for feedback about whether or not they think my suggestions feel helpful .   I always encourage clients to be really honest with me about this.  I tell them that I would hate for them to agree to try things that they know they won't try just to avoid ""hurting my feelings"" or ""offending me.""  I want to be helpful and while I have the expertise as far as typically helpful  strategies, I really like to work collaboratively and have clients tell me what they do and don't like / agree with or not agree with when I share my thoughts about a treatment plan .  We the   work together to come up with a plan that will be helpful , but also realistic and then revise it and try new things if necessary as we go along.   If things aren't improving , I am very happy and willing to try something new ! I hope this is helpful for you ! ","The process can be complex since the best counseling experiences result when there is a therapeutic alliance between the client and therapist. Here are some steps that take place in a counseling relationship when establishing a therapeutic alliance:1. Assessment - Gathering Information: Once a counselor and client agree to work together, the very first step is to begin the process of understanding one another. This means gathering information about what brings the client to treatment, goals for treatment, what the client is hoping to gain, how he or she would like to participate in the therapy, areas of the client’s history and present life that are relevant to treatment, information about his or her current life circumstances, and what support the client has in his or her life. The counselor will also assess what life areas the client wishes to work on in session, such as depression, anxiety, interpersonal issues, relationship difficulties, trauma, and others depending on the issues.  The counselor may also use some assessment instruments to gain insight into certain areas of the clients presentation.2. Establishing a Therapeutic Alliance - The Alliance: Before you can begin to work on any of your issues, you need to trust your therapist with your life and your deepest fears. Once a client feels comfortable with their therapist, it is important for the therapist to clearly communicate what they believe are the keys to a healthy and successful working relationship, that way the client will know how best to work with them. As a counselor, once you have established a therapeutic alliance with your client, you begin to set the tone for treatment and establish therapeutic boundaries. Together you establish what is happening in the therapy room and is expected, what is not expected, how treatment will take place, how and when you will work together, and what your confidentiality looks like. This is called establishing a therapeutic alliance and may even include discussion of the counselors stance toward issues, such as beliefs and values. As the therapeutic relationship develops the relationship becomes more intimate, complex, and is the base of the treatment.  It takes time for clients and therapists to establish that therapeutic alliance.3. Determining Treatment Plan - What to Address: Once you know who you are as a person and what areas you would like to work on in therapy, you can begin to set goals for treatment. The counselor will work with you to define goals that are manageable for you and to help you set up realistic outcomes for treatment. This step often requires discussion and feedback. During this step you may ask any questions that you may have, such as “will we be using a particular modality in treatment”, or, “how will you know when I have reached my goals?” These are just a few examples of questions that can be asked during this step.   Counselors will also make adjustments to treatment when they see that your needs change.  4. Working Through the Plan - Treatment: Depending on the issue you decide to address, treatment will be developed in a unique way for each person. This includes determining what type of modality, such as cognitive behavioral or psychodynamic, to use, how often and when to meet, and how to begin addressing your goals. It is also when we would start to work through the issues that brought you into treatment.",0.4497528672218323
I feel really uncomfortable when I have people's attention.  It makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class. Can I get over this social anxiety?,"Since anxiety usually about anticipating a bad result, or fear of being judged negatively, as though having failed some sort of test, consider what would give you the feeling of anticipating a good result from talking to an audience?Maybe, for example, if you prepared and rehearsed your talk more than what you typically would, you'd feel more secure in speaking  in front of an audience.Once you sort through your particular reason as to the source of your discomfort, it may feel more manageable.Yes, social anxiety can change.  You may naturally prefer smaller groups than an audience.And, it is possible to decrease anxiety in what may always be somewhat uncomfortable for you.","The fear of speaking up and having people's attention can be really difficult because of our deep-rooted belief about what others think of us (people have to like us, they want us to look and feel good, etc). Many times social anxiety can come about from negative and harmful messages. You can re-write this belief through...*1. Reframing: Try re-framing what is happening, instead of it being ""I'm going to fail"" try something like ""I am going to give it my best effort, maybe not everyone will like what I have to say, I can't make everyone like me."" Instead of ""people are judging me"", try, ""I am feeling judged, I'm going to ignore what people think of me, I'm going to focus on what is going on here in the moment"".*2. Self-Compassion: Everyone makes mistakes. Everyone fails. It's okay to make mistakes.  We all make mistakes, if not, then we are not human. If you fail, we are going to be your biggest supporter and not be angry at you (you).  When we get into these situations like yours and others, they are hard and challenging, but if we can learn to show ourselves compassion we have a better chance of getting through it and moving forward. (https://www.mindful.org/self-compassion-for-anxiety/) and (http://www.compassion.com/)*3. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: ACT is a psychological and philosophical approach that helps you learn to accept yourself and your mistakes as part of life, rather than fight against the natural processes. While it does involve a lot of work and has to be practiced, it's very effective for many people, including your anxieties (http://www.actlikeyourself.com/).**Find a Therapist in Your Area to Talk To** Anxiety can be very limiting and we don't always realize how much we can recover from our own natural self-help techniques. If you are having great difficulty or if your anxiety is really difficult, then please talk with a counselor in your area who will help you work through your social anxiety in a supportive and safe environment. Please remember that anxiety is a normal emotion and that the techniques and exercises I have described here are intended for people who aren't comfortable with having a therapist help them. I would suggest if you feel really uncomfortable speaking up or are uncomfortable around other people in general that we can begin to talk in some way and you can get used to speaking up. From there, I can also help you to do some of the techniques listed above if you want to.",0.4486768841743469

We have our great moments, but I just need to focus on my personal situations, and I feel he is slowing me down with that.

From your question it seems like a very difficult time for you. First and foremost, if you are in an abusive household situation (whether physical, sexual or emotional abuse) then there are several steps you can take to address it:  1. Recognize and acknowledge what is going on. 2. Make sure that you are safe: If your abusive situation requires that you move away from your home, contact a friend or relative to stay with. If you can not go away from your home, seek a place to go that is a local shelter that can give you temporary assistance. Local shelters offer phone numbers you can call in times of need. In addition, some states have domestic violence hotline numbers you can call. You can also call the national domestic violence hotline at 800-799-7233. You may also want to consider contacting your school counselor or social worker. They can offer to help you in several ways to help you cope with this situation. 3. Seek a therapist to help you cope with the abuse and trauma you have experienced. 4. Make a list of the abuse or violence you have experienced. This list will help you to work through it in the counseling process to begin to overcome these difficulties. 5. Do not blame yourself or your parents for what is happening in the home or situation.  Abuse situations are a situation of abuse of power and an inability to take responsibility.  You cannot control or change your situation, and you are not responsible for your parents' abusive behaviors. Please know that many people your age are going through similar situations and you are not alone.

"I've been bullied for years and the teachers have done nothing about it. I haven't been diagnosed with depression, but i have been extremely sad for years.

How can I deal with being bullied at school when the teachers won't help?","To be bullied is very painful.I'm glad you know the bullies are doing the wrong thing and whatever they are telling you is pure meanness.Depending on how independent you feel, why not tell either your classroom teacher or schedule an appointment with the vice principal?Bullying other students is taken very seriously in some states and schools are expected to address the bullying until the victimized student feels safe.If you hesitate to do this on your own, then would you ask either of your parents or even a friend of yours who is also in the school, to report the problem?In case you are afraid the bullies will retaliate for reporting them, then tell this to whatever school authority you decide to ask for help.You're entitled to be protected by your school.","It is very important to know that the bullying is NOT your fault. While it is possible that if the bullies were stopped then no one else would be bullied, that is simply not true of schools or any other location where bullying takes place. It is also possible that the bullies would target you because they see you are a weaker victim than others they can easily target.The sad thing is that you have not gotten any help from the school to make you feel safe and less stressed. I suggest finding a therapist to help you with this. Knowing you are not alone, talking about it, learning tools to help you cope and make the situation better, and making a plan to protect yourself and your wellbeing are essential. If your bullies are people with whom you can befriend, that would certainly be a more secure place to be than school. At school, you can often find support groups and other peer groups you could participate in. Also, teachers and other school staff should be able to help you report the bullying to school officials.",0.49294763803482056
"Sometimes, when I look at my pet cat, I think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him. It makes me sad because I love him, but I always think about how helpless he is. There've even been split-seconds where I felt almost tempted to kick him, followed by shame and guilt.","A lot of different things could be happening here. Do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is? If you have not actually kicked him, then I would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt, since you did not hurt him. What else is there?It would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you. It could be that you feel safe with your cat, so strong emotions come up because you feel safe.","The fact that you are asking the question, shows a great deal of concern for your cat's wellbeing. The good news is that this is normal for most pet owners, we care about those whom we love, that is a natural part of the human condition. This behaviour is called empathy or compassion, where feelings of care for animals (and people) is experienced. The bad news is that this is often an area which has some negative implications: you could unintentionally hurt your cat. As such, being mindful of the way you behave around your cat, is paramount. In saying this, being mindful of how you feel when you do become overwhelmed by the natural desires to hurt a living creature, is the better way of addressing the situation. Be mindful of the fact that you feel guilty about the impulses you experience, this shows you are someone who is able to empathise and feel compassionately, which is an extremely desirable trait.  If you find yourself becoming overwhelmed by these feelings of distress, then consider seeking help from a counsellor.",0.505088210105896

I am not familiar with the specific area you are located in, but I would ask your family doctor to offer any options for support that are free or low cost.  You are also able to search online for a grief support group in your area.  It can be helpful to talk with others who understand what you are going through and who can offer advice and support.  I would also recommend checking out grief.org for a list of grief support groups that are located throughout the United States.  If you are having suicidal thoughts I would encourage you to contact your doctor immediately to talk about getting help before you harm yourself.  I would also like to remind you that your feelings are your own and that anyone is allowed to feel exactly how they feel in response to a major loss.  It is okay to cry and it is okay to have other emotions too.  Don't pressure yourself to get ""better"" or get over this loss.  Just focus on taking care of yourself and leaning on your support system.  I am so sorry again for your loss, and I hope that you find the support you need.",0.4894634485244751
"When I see something I don’t like, I go off like a ticking time bomb. I go from “0 to 100” really quickly.","Sometimes we react to situations immediately, without thinking of the consequences of our actions. Typically by not reacting right away, we are better able to gather our thoughts, see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives, and respond more calmly. One of the strategies that almost always helps is deep breathing. When faced with a stressful situation, you can give yourself a time out by removing yourself from the stress and spend 5 minutes taking deep breaths (breathe in slowly counting to 4 and breathe out even slower counting to 6), while focusing and thinking only about your breathing. After doing so, think of the various ways you can respond to the situation and choose the one most appropriate. Good luck!","We all have triggers - things, situations, or people that trigger a very intense, sometimes painful emotion in us.  And when we experience our triggers, we can get caught in cycles of feeling triggered, reacting impulsively, and then feeling horrible afterward.  In a moment of intense emotion like this, there is not a lot of thinking or reflection; rather, you become trapped in a cycle of intense emotion. One thing that can help a lot is to create a new cycle. If we're going to break a cycle, we need to understand how it works. In this case, your trigger is something else person's behavior. You react strongly. You go from ""0 to 100"". Then, it takes time for you to cool off and put things back into perspective. Breaking the cycle is not something we can do in a moment. We need time to cool off. So one thing that can help is to tell yourself: ""I'm going to spend the next ten minutes cooling off. When I start to cool off, I'll reflect on what triggered me and what I want my reaction to be in the future. When I want to react differently, I'll think about this"".  This strategy is about doing something that won't lead to shame or feeling worse about yourself. Another strategy is to create a mantra. This is an affirmation or something you say to yourself to help you calm down and feel a little bit more in control. I've worked with many people who say ""I'm in control. I'm okay. My reaction is my choice, not the other person's behavior"". As a last tip, seek out the support of a close friend or family member. There are many resources out there, but your trusted circle of friends is a great place to start!",0.49266159534454346
I need to speak to someone about sexual addiction and binge eating immediately.,There are plenty of online providers within the mental health field that would me more than happy to speak with you immediately.  Many of them provide treatment on a sliding scale fee.  I would google online mental health treatment providers and that should lead you to a list of providers that can help you. ,"Since you recognize you have a problem, take this as a positive sign.

If you don't have a primary care physician, or you don't trust your primary physician, I suggest finding a therapist with experience in addictions who would be able to help you. You can google a therapist by their location and then ask whether they are licensed to practice in your state, and do they have experience working with addictions and binge eating. There are more and more counselors who specialize in this area of counseling, so you shouldn't have a tough time finding someone. Be sure to ask about their approach to the problem.

Ooph, that's a tough one, right?! I know. But here's the thing, when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away.

Your feelings are valid, so make sure that you clearly and directly share them so that your partner gets the feeling that you are sharing your experience instead of trying to make him feel guilty. Then, make it clear that you feel that your feelings may be connected, but  you're concerned about the impact of his behavior on his sex drive. If he agrees to be more responsive to you, it sounds like you have an understanding of what kind of contact would feel good to you.

How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,This is a tough decision to make for anyone that has ever been involved in a relationship.  My advice is for you to consider what is making you unhappy in this relationship.  Sometimes we think we are ready to move on but don't know the reason why and then we regret it.  The worst thing you want after the fact is to have regret.  Take time to do some soul searching and imagine your life without this person before you make any decisions.  This will also help you understand what it is you are looking for in a romantic relationship.

   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","The short answer is: absolutely not! The longer answer is that it might take some time to process all of the issues, and it may feel quite ""muddy"" in the issues for a lot longer than is tolerable (which is why counseling may have been postponed to begin with for you.) It's important to be realistic when entering counseling of any sort, and that the therapist be realistic with you about what you might be able to expect working with that person (I use the words ""might be able to expect"" because therapy experiences can vary.) But that not having counseling about trauma that you have experienced much earlier in your life can play a significant role in the process and how long that process could take to unpack all that may have been buried over time.It might also be helpful in counseling to work with the therapist on figuring out where to begin, but to also manage the feelings of being overwhelmed that may make it hard to continue to show up and do the work required, week in and week out. It isn't easy work trying to process past pain that you experienced, and so consistent practice of self-care, including leaning on support systems outside of therapy, is key.","A counselor may suggest addressing several problems, however, they are usually dealt with in the order the person feels ready to address them.   A counselor will address the problem that feels most important to you first.  A counselor may also suggest, as in your question, that one problem be addressed at a time.  The person may also be better able to handle one problem at a time since addressing several at the same time may become overwhelming.",0.47443515062332153
"I have PTSD. The side effects are really bad and have impacts on sex, anger and my relationships. I even lost my job month ago.    How can I get my life back?","Slowly is the rate at which you'll get back your life.Being traumatized means not feeling safe in almost all areas of life.Be patient with yourself as you try to regain trust that people will not harm you and will be sources of satisfaction in your life.It is possible that the trauma in your life requires such great attention on your part to your own inner emotional safety that you are better off with a less intensive job than the one you recently lost.Try to prioritize restoring your emotional and psychological health.  With this as the top area of your attention then you may have an easier time to accept a lesser degree of involvement in your work and relationships.When you feel angry, try to examine if underlying the anger are feelings of stress, fear, insecurity regarding your position in relationship to the person toward whom you feel angry.   Anger is often the surface reaction to more destabilizing emotions like fear and insecurity.Gradually by nurturing and comforting yourself, living at a pace which is uniquely comfortable to what and how much you can handle, you'll regain your trust in both yourself and relating to others.","Hi Durham, I'm so sorry you lost your job. That really stings to lose the security of a good employment. Having PTSD makes finding work very difficult. There are 7,000 companies on Linkedin. Now I can't tell you how many of them are open to hiring someone with PTSD but it's definitely something I would address during an interview, maybe using a support organisation. You can certainly find work, it's just finding a supportive one that I can't guarantee. Right now I'm not even sure which direction you want your work to go, but sometimes having a clear picture helps. I'm also guessing that the relationships in your life may be strained as well due to your symptoms. I wonder if, in addition to finding work, it might be helpful to see a good therapist that can give you a good assessment of your PTSD, and give you ways of managing the symptoms. I also think you're right to seek help with the sex. Sometimes the connection between PTSD and sex goes completely unaddressed and if so there are multiple options, some of which might make your current symptoms of anger worse. Sex itself doesn't automatically make you angry, anger can certainly make sex worse. I'm hoping this is the start of your recovery. Take care,Laura I. Leckman, M.D.",0.41824907064437866
I read that you should ignore them and they have to come to a conclusion that they were wrong on their own terms.

I don't want to lose my wife but we need to have a space because we usually hit each other and it's not healthy. I'm dying to make our relationship healthy. I've never wanted anything more than this. Please help me. I need your advice.","Hello. It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight, and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage. I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now. Marriages take lots of work, and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young - good, bad, or indifferent. There are no easy answers to your questions, and I won't presume that my response to you will be the linch-pin that heals all your pain. But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. No one is perfect. We fail more often than we succeed, but in the end we learn, and that learning helps us grow. Yes, you're right, the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good, and need to stop. You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard, and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. Seeing a therapist for yourself, and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. You have issues that you need to resolve, that, while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life, they are separate from your marriage in many respects.Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. You can find these through local counseling resources. Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. If you belong to a religious or spiritual community, then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed, so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you.Lastly, parents are imperfect. Yep...its true. They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. We limp along and do our best. Having said that, we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future, no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid, and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. Both with ourselves, and toward other people. So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit.  I am sure that remains to be seen, but either way you both must be involved in saving it. If only one of you cares, then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. That's not fair. So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants, and work to create an amicable solution. All of this said, seek out supportive friends, and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life. One way or the other, you will benefit from it.Be well.","Hi Seattle, I'm very sorry to hear that you and your wife are struggling in your relationship. From your question I gather that you've been through a lot of ups and downs with your family during your life. When we have difficulty in relationships due to past hurts, they often tend to bubble up with the smallest triggers. Being so far along in your marriage it is likely the same type of behaviour is surfacing from your wife. I highly recommend you seek out the help of a couple's therapist to help you both understand these triggers and learn new ways of interacting with one another. If this is not an option, then you might consider getting individual counselling so that you can feel stronger emotionally and also have a space to work on setting healthy boundaries for yourself and your wife. As far as you looking like your mom, I don't know how old you are, but it seems as though your body developed as if it were your mother's. Even if you decide to go to a genetic test, the outcome would likely only serve to confuse you further. Take care of yourself Seattle, and I hope you two get through this!",0.39959216117858887
I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"The best way to move on is to give yourself sufficient time and space away from your ex so you can heal.  That means no checking out your ex on social media platforms and no contact.  In order to move on and diminish the obsessions, help yourself recognize and accept that the relationship is over, and make sure to get sufficient support in processing all your feelings.  Once that takes place, it can be useful to explore and process with a professional the meaning of the relationship and to understand your part in what transpired.Sometimes people obsess because they have difficulties accepting what's already taken place and want things to be different.  The key to moving forward is to be loving toward yourself, to give yourself permission to grieve the loss, and to start cultivating new and healthy habits/patterns.  Reengage in your present life, ask yourself what you want your life to look like, and start creating goals and taking small steps to create the amazing life you want for yourself.","This is quite common.  It is normal to feel as if your heart is still broken for a certain amount of time and even to feel it being broken and re-mended over and over again.  The ""re-mending"" part comes from doing all the things we normally do when we think about a broken heart - we start to focus on how much better we were in the relationship, how well we loved them, how we took care of them, the things we did for them.  It feels as if you are just taking care of something that is injured and trying to fix it.The best thing to do is start to do everything that person you are now loves and cares about - do those things for YOU first.  This way, when you think about the person and how you feel, it is not about how you miss them and feel sorry for yourself.  It is a reminder to yourself that you are kind and caring and wonderful and good and that is all important.  When we are in a relationship, we can start to lose that part of ourselves and lose sight of what we love and want in life.  That part of yourself needs to be re-discovered. If you are having a difficult time doing these things for yourself without dwelling on the relationship, seek professional help.  If your breakup was very recent, it is normal to have the symptoms you are describing. If the breakup was a few months or longer ago, you may benefit from some counselling support.  You don't need to be completely heartbroken for this to be helpful.  Your sense of self and your own self-care, is the most important thing. Best wishes,Sarah",0.4777146577835083
How does a person start the counseling process?,The first thing to do is to reflect on what you want to seek counseling. Search online and then set up a phone consultation. A person can find out a lot about a counselor and the services that they offer over the phone. After a consultation then set up an intake questions. The overall goal is to make sure that you are comfortable with the counselor and the services they can offer.,"The counselor should be available to the client (through phone and/or email) when the client wishes to make an appointment. Usually the first session is a free consultation that can be made via phone or by email. During this session the client and counselor get a sense of one another, and the counselor can make a good faith effort to determine if the client is a good fit for counseling with them. The first session also provides the counselor a time to tell the client more about their practice, how they work, what they expect, what confidentiality exists, and the overall costs of counseling. If after that session the client and counselor feel as though they are a good fit, then the next step is to make an appointment.",0.5120552182197571
"I was in a relationship with a woman for four years. We both made mistakes, but I do love her.    She has moved in with another lady. I think she is just cheating on me to make me miss her. How can I find out for sure?","Has your former partner made any efforts to be in contact with you in order to restart your relationship?From what you describe, your former partner is in a new relationship.It is possible that since you love her and would like to be together again, that you are misinterpreting your former partner's actions.If you'd like to have more certainty as to wether your former partner is cheating or whether she is happy to be with the new partner, is to contact her and ask her your question.A better road may be to accept your sad feelings that she is with someone else.Since she was meaningful to you, respect the sadness you feel and that the relationship didn't continue as you wished.","You're in a challenging situation. A therapist could help you sort through the emotions and then help you make some decisions about how to move forward. I'm not sure if what you describe is ""cheating"" or not - if that means she is being sexually unfaithful without your knowledge or consent. If that's what you mean, then you have right to decide how you'll handle it. But you don't have to do so without her knowing. Sometimes when a therapist is involved, it can be helpful for you both to know what each of you is doing so that you can make the best decisions possible.",0.5024666786193848
My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.,"You should start by speaking with her about what has her so down. Have their been some significant events in her life that have affected her? Have their been significant events in your relationship that can be affecting  you both? If she just stopped drinking, she may be struggling to finding an alternative and healthier behavior. This is something the two of you can explore together. Also, if need be perhaps she can speak to a therapist to discuss her feelings about quitting alcohol. It sounds like you really care and right now she could use all the support she can get despite her pushing you away.","I am so sorry to hear that your girlfriend is depressed because she quit drinking.  Quitting alcohol is a huge life change and it can be very difficult, especially if you have been drinking heavily for a while. There are withdrawal symptoms that she may be experiencing. The fact that you want her to stay is a wonderful thing. One thing you can do is to look into some local alcohol recovery meetings.  Also, if you are in a marriage and she has not gotten a therapist yet or quit drinking through therapy, your girlfriend should definitely seek help. A therapist can help to give her the tools to continue staying sober, and they can also help with any depression that may arise from this change. As far as if you can help her... You can go with her to meetings, encourage her, and offer to help her in any ways she needs you. Of course, it is ultimately up to her as far as if she decides to move or not. The best thing that you can do is to be supportive, if she is willing, and if she needs help, make her aware that there are a lot of resources available to her to keep her sober. Hang in there... Recovery is a process and it takes time. Sometimes it is very difficult, but if your girlfriend is committed to staying sober, it will be a worthwhile journey. Also, be sure to take care of yourself too, because her addiction may have negatively impacted you. There are also resources available to you if you need help.",0.5078922510147095
"I'm feeling rejected and frustrated. This is not new. The first month we were together, sex was about every day. Then it slowed down to once a month right away. I love my husband, but I am struggling with this.","   Feeling rejected and frustrated is a reasonable reaction to your experience with your husband. I want to encourage you that his actions may have little to do with you, and regardless of outcomes, I hope you find the help you need to process through your pain and still have hope for your marriage.   If your husband was to work with me I'd explore with him his understanding of, and experience with, intimacy in relationship with others. Furthermore, like other male clients of mine, I'd challenge your husband to secure an updated full medical exam from his PCP (primary care physician) and/or urologist in order to identify or rule out any organic issues which may be causing his apparent lack of desire for sexual intimacy. If there are no physical issues, per se, I would encourage your husband to process further his family of origin story-line regarding rules, roles, sex, and sexuality along with working through his sexual and trauma histories. ","The more you tell your husband about your need for your sexual needs being met, the easier it will become to talk to him about it.  What do you feel when you wait a month or more without having sex with your husband?  Try explaining this to him in a calm way.  The more you talk to your husband with calm and openness, the better your communication will be.It's important that both your husband and you want to be satisfied in your sexual relationship.   Sex is one part of being intimate with your partner, so if there are other things you are not satisfied with in your relationship, this may also lead to dissatisfaction in your sexual relationship.  What other things make you unhappy in your relationship?Communication is the key to a healthy sexual relationship.  I wish you the best of luck!",0.46533411741256714
"My daughter didn't see her biological father for the last three years. She doesn’t want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse. The visitation is with supervision, but she refuses to see him. Is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy?","Hi Dillon,I'm from Canada, so I don't know the laws in your state. It depends on that a good deal, perhaps. In my opinion, a child should never be forced into a situation where they feel unsafe, even if it is ""supervised"". If the child is old enough to make a strong statement about not wanting to see a parent, then this should be honoured. Unfortunately, the laws don't always uphold a parent's right to do what is best for their child. I recommend you see a lawyer, who will advise you about how to proceed without putting yourself at risk of breaching custody agreements.If you feel your daughter can benefit from therapy, that is a separate question. Or is she already in therapy? A family therapist will typically meet with you alone first, in order to determine if therapy is a wise move for your child. It isn't always appropriate.","You're not alone.  Many parents find it hard to accept the idea of letting the children see a parent who has a history of abuse, neglect, or violence.  Whether the therapist recommends that you get the kids to visit their father, or doesn't, is a tough decision.  I know it doesn't help, but I'll say it anyway: It's your decision.  The therapist will not force you to do anything.  The kids can't decide for themselves what they want, you're their protective parent right now, which is totally understandable.  However, eventually the kids (you're daughter) will tell you what they want, and you will have to decide whether you agree with what they say.    It's a very emotional decision, and a difficult one.  Hopefully it won't have to be made soon.  I wish you and your daughter the best of luck.",0.4613233208656311
"I have had a crush on this guy for years. I last talked to him a few years ago when we graduated from high school. We left off on a good note. Should I message him and see how he is doing, or is it too late?","You'll only find out whether or not it is ""too late"", by following through with wanting to message him.Regardless of whether the response you receive is what you'd hoped to hear, including not hearing back from him, you will have done yourself a great honor and respect by following through on a wish and curiosity you've had for some time.","Hi New Jersey, Yes, it is absolutely too late!  He's moved on. He has no obligations to return your messages or have any interest in re-connecting.  However, you could send him a quick note, something like, ""Hey, I was thinking about our conversations in school back in the day. It was really fun to talk with you in class...wish you the best!""  Then watch his reaction.  If he responds well, perhaps you could continue conversations and see where things go.  If he doesn't respond...then send your good-bye message and leave it at that.  It may be a shame that you haven't reconnected with him, and you may regret not doing it, but in the long run it's best to let go and put your energy into someone who returns your interest and treats you with respect.",0.5166841149330139
"My parents seem okay with other sexualities, but normally they only talk about being gay. When they do talk about bisexuality, they say things like “they'll do anything” or things that make me very uncomfortable because I am bisexual. I don't know if I am ready to come out to them.","Perhaps you are not ready to come out to your parents.  Often times our readiness is not dependent on what others' will say or how they react. But more so dependent on how emotionally prepared we are to deal with others' reactions.  It may be beneficial for you to play out each possible scenario and conclusion (eg. your parents being supportive vs. your parents being disappointed and so on). How are you prepared to deal with the outcome?  You may also seek help through counselors, support groups and/or individuals you know that have dealt with similar situations to help you prepare to discuss this with your parents.  All the best!","Is your mom okay with your relationship with this other straight girl you are dating?If you are okay with the way your parents are, this is called being 'affirming'. If the way your parents are making you feel in this relationship is not okay, you should communicate how you feel and what you need in that relationship. I think this is the time to see how you are handling rejection.If they do not accept who you are, the important thing to say to yourself is ""If that is who they are, I don't need to be who they want me to be"". You might not have to come out to your parents, but you have to find ways of accepting yourself for who you are, and you don't have to force them to be the kind of people you want them to be.

I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.","Hello. Coming to terms with the idea that you might be of a sexuality other than the one in which you were socially raised to be, can be emotionally disturbing, and quite unsettling. It creates anxiety, maybe even panic, and leaves us feeling confused and uncertain about our own sense of identity. It becomes important to first ask yourself how you feel when you are thinking of being intimate with guys, or if you desire them to be intimate with you. It is important to know what impact this has on you, because it can determine your level of follow through and desire in pursuing sexual activity with someone of the same sex. I am not going to pass judgment on you either way - even for having the thoughts. I have worked with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) community in various ways over the years. Many I speak to, say they had to struggle to come to terms with this awareness about how they see themselves sexually. Maybe you are bisexual, and don't have an exclusive attraction to the same sex. You might consider doing some searches online for community support groups in your area, to explore the feelings and issues around this topic. Talking to someone who you trust can be helpful too. Running from your feelings is not a good idea, and others in a support group for sexuality issues, might be able to relate to you and what you're going through right now. This will offer you perspective, as you think on how this plays out in your life.Counselors are typically well trained to provide clinical services to clients who are experiencing feelings and thoughts much like the ones you are having now. I encourage you to consider reaching out for help. You are not crazy or insane for thinking of working with a counselor, nor of having feelings of same sex attraction. If you decide you are indeed gay, then know that you are not alone and never will be alone in that feeling. There is a huge community of support for you. Additionally, we all need help sometimes dealing with all sort of issues. A counselor can work more in depth with you to examine the motivations behind the feelings, and help you come to terms with them more directly. I hope that you come to a place where you feel less alone and more secure with yourself as you examine this area of your life. No matter what, do not fear being yourself. Again...you are not alone, I promise.Warm regards,Shawn Berthel, M.S., LMHC","In short, yes this can happen. But the fact that you have done a lot of work around what you imagine to be ""normal"" and then find this new direction seems to be taking you is really indicative of how flexible human sexuality is. Being gay or straight doesn't come with a ""pack of rules"" and certainly not a guarantee of a lifetime's worth of preferences. In fact, it is more accurate to see your sexual orientation on a continuum and you can choose who to have sex with any given moment. You are being very wise to explore this. Having a therapist help you is a great first step because while it can be difficult to admit you are gay, you could also be on the beginning of something wonderful.",0.4139975309371948

She has been a very big part of both me and my kids’ life, but now last month, my dad told me that he really likes my friend and wants to marry her. She’s like a sister to me. My kids hate the idea.","How are you measuring whether or not your dad understands your wish?Your dad understanding your wish does not mean he will necessarily follow through with what you want.Based on what you describe about your relationship to the woman in question, your discomfort with the idea of your dad marrying your friend, is reasonable.Have the conversation with your dad that includes your viewpoint, and also ask him for his impression of your feelings.Its even possible he already has considered your feelings and hasn't yet told you.It is also possible that a conversation on the subject, as well as your dad following through with his decision to marry your best friend, may develop in a very positive way.Part of the current uneasiness you feel may be from fear of how a change in circumstances and introducing new relationship dynamics might feel.Given that the person who died was your mom, maybe your emotions are not yet ready seeing your dad with a replacement spouse. Try to see the situation from the point of everyone, including yourself, who is involved in this major change.  Maybe having a family discussion about acceptance and readiness to accept a new partner for your dad, would open new empathy for all of these family members.","Have you talked with your dad about it?It sounds like you'd really like your dad to be able to make the decision of who to marry without your friend being in the way.

Counseling can help you to deal with things before they get out of hand.Give counseling a try.,"Whether counseling will help depends a great deal on several factors. It's really something that's best talked about with your therapist or counselor. Your therapist will need to assess your situation and what you're seeking. If you know the problems you're having and what you're trying to accomplish, the conversation will make a lot of sense. I'm going to tell you about some basic counselling concepts, and I'll go into more detail if that's what you'd like. One thing to understand is that most therapists or counselors will ask you to set some sort of goal in what they call a ""treatment plan"" which I'll describe more in depth in a moment. The therapist's goal is for you to work towards accomplishing this. Sometimes, you'll work toward accomplishing a goal, and this may change over time as you work with your counselor. The counseling actually helps a lot of people with anxiety, depression, anger, stress, addiction, etc. It depends on what the problems are and whether you're able to work toward a goal with the help of your therapist. Here's a treatment plan example that you can see online to get an idea of what a treatment plan looks like for one person. https://therapyresourcecenter.com/the-basics-of-a-treatment-plan/I hope that was helpful.

"I just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. My family and I really need this job.
   People keep telling me I have ""anxiety"" and I'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. This is all new to me. What can I do?","Hi, It is really good that you are working so hard to take care of your family. Anxiety can be so challenging, especially when new challenges have come up. It would be good to work through some of these issues you are experiencing, and examine your self care and support processes.","Here are some tips.  First, make sure your home state is ""on a good list"" in terms of anxiety support.  What I mean is, does your home state have accessible and affordable care when you need it, and is that in a place that you feel comfortable going? If you can, make sure your care team knows of your anxiety and that they can provide support if needed.  One approach that is very helpful is to plan. If you know that in the past, anxiety attacks used to trigger anxiety attacks related to a certain time of day or a certain amount of time in a car, this can help you plan.  Can you keep yourself occupied? Sometimes we get so caught up in the anxiety that we don't know where time has gone.  Or perhaps the thing we are doing is going to make us feel less anxious when we complete it.  Or are you able to take a time out on the road? If so, perhaps use a local park or a rest stop.  Many airports have support areas or relaxation areas and it may be possible that you can find one on the road.  Consider also using relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing to stay grounded.  I hope this helps.",0.49159932136535645
"I'm in my late teens and live with my dad.  The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I won't want to talk to them for days or even weeks. 

Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.

Are they right, am I depressed?","Hello. Being a teenager in our society today can cause depression quite easily. We look at the world in which we live, and the doubts we have about being able to make a contribution, or to have value and worth with the people around us, and we begin to internalize those messages of self-worth. If that alone were not enough, you are trying to figure out where you want to go in life, and who you are supposed to be in the world. Teens are faced with pressures of being judged by your peers for how you present yourself; following current fashions; possessing the trendy things; and hanging out with the ""in crowd."" Here's a ""secret"" that might help with most of those issues: Not much of those problems I've just described will really matter as they might seem to right now, in the real world. If you are feeling depression because you feel you lack some of those things that are seen as important by others (like your peers), I can assure you that being someone who is kind; compassionate; understanding of another person's suffering; and the effort you make to be the best person you can become in the world, will far outweigh anything you experienced in your teen years.When we are young, we judge everything based on what our peers have, what they say, the way they dress, who's popular, who's not popular, and for the most of it, all of that is external. So the question becomes, are you trying to fix the feelings on the inside (the internal stuff), with the trappings of all the stuff on the outside (the internal)? That is to say, do you feel that if you had what your friends have, you would be happy and less depressed? Depression is usually a symptom of something much bigger, it is not typically a problem by itself (just as a person who experiences a high temperature may likely have a cold). So fixing the symptom requires looking at the possible causes. In your post, you mentioned that you live with your dad. Are your parents divorced or separated, or has your mom passed away? Either of these circumstances could certainly cause depression. Finding out when you started feeling depressed, might be able to pinpoint the trigger that caused it, which requires looking at when you last felt really happy. It is also important to keep in mind, that as a teenager, your emotions are often being experienced very randomly, and sometimes without cause. It is part of your emotional development, but as you grow older can learn how to manage those emotions better and practice doing things that help you feel better (without causing harm to yourself).Have you tried talking to your dad about your feelings, or maybe another relative if you feel safer doing so? Do you have a friend who is your best friend...someone who is there for you no matter what? If not, there is a service you can use that is a national number for teens to talk with teen peer counselors. They are teens like yourself, but they have some insights that might be helpful. Its called Teen Line (https://teenlineonline.org/). It helped me when I was in my teens, and has helped lots of other teens as well. You might find a place to get some referrals to other local services in your area. If you want are in Washington state and would like to connect with me directly, you call link to me via my profile page. Or perhaps finding a counselor in your local area might be useful. Most towns and cities have some form of low cost counseling. You might also check with your school for assistance.Don't be afraid of not always knowing how you are supposed to feel. Adults don't always have a handle on it either. Being a teenager carries a lot stress, fear, and uncertainty. But you are not alone, and there is help if you reach out for it.

I’m facing severe depression and anxiety and I just feel like I’m going through a lot. This really distracts me and I cant get my mind off the things that are bothering me.    How do I overcome this anxierty and depression?,Anxiety and depression are often linked. I don't consider them as diseases. Depression is a symptom of deep hurts to the sense of self that leaves a person feeling shamed. Anxiety is a symptom of not being given the proper emotional resources to handle the problems of life. It is also the result of being taught that life is a dangerous place that can't be managed.,"Depression and anxiety can feel overwhelming, but you can learn ways to cope with the anxiety and depression.  You can start by talking to your doctor to learn more about effective medications, and then try to make adjustments in your daily living, like getting more sunlight, and being physically active.  You can also talk to a therapist to help learn the daily coping skills that will improve how you manage this difficult time in your life.  Best of luck in your healing journey!",0.4901764392852783
"My husband and I have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. Others have told me that most men would have left me by now. Honestly, I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing. I want to be better connected with my husband.","It's encouraging that you say you want ""to be better connected with [your] husband,"" and since he hasn't left you, he must care about you and the relationship more than he does about just having sex. You don't say whether he complains or not, but even if he doesn't it seems there's a sense of something important missing for both of you.Most likely to connect better with him physically you'll need to become better connected with yourself and your body. Men often feel fulfilled by sex simply because it happened - the woman they want received them, allowed them to make love with her. For women that can sometimes be more complicated. A woman who loves sex most likely also loves her body, knows what pleasures her, and feels confident asking for what she wants. Self-pleasuring can be a way for you to discover more about your sexuality, and a classic resource is Betty Dodson's book Sex for One: The Joy of Selfloving. A good counselor or sex therapist can be very helpful with your whole relationship as well as the sexual part of it, but not all counselors are comfortable working with sexual issues. Shop around and be sure you find someone who can help you and your husband get better connected on all levels.","It is not a given that most men would have left you by now.  The truth is, there are so many reasons why they will stay or leave.  The number of times you have sex is simply one possibility.  If you are satisfied with your sex life, and your husband is too, then there is nothing to be concerned about.  On the other hand, if you have conversations, including the ones in the last paragraph, about how satisfied you are with your sexual relationship with your husband, you can take the next steps toward improvement.  The first step in resolving any problem is to agree that there is a problem. Then, in the last paragraph, you are saying that both you and your husband are concerned that there might be a problem.  Now you have the next steps.  Work together with your husband to figure out how to resolve this.  Since neither one of you knows what you're doing, talking to a doctor or therapist will help you learn the basics of sex, as well as communication skills needed for this situation.  It is never a bad idea to seek counseling and therapy when you feel that you need help in the relationship you are in.",0.4454193711280823
"I'm a teenager and I get these really intense mood swings.    My mood will be really high and I'll think of something that I want to do. When I start to make it happen I get irritated by other people if they intervene. Then if the thing I wanted to do doesn't work out, I have these tendencies to blame other people for it not working out.    Can you explain what's going on?","Mood swings and getting frustrated when things don't work out is totally normal. Sometimes, we get tied to one thing we really want to do and it can feel pretty intense when that gets interrupted or doesn't work out. This said, you're coming to CounselChat and so I'm guessing this is something that is pretty intense for you and something that you are concerned about. If this is getting in the way of your life, it may be worthwhile to reach out to a therapist or doctor to get some help with this and see if there might be something more going on. While for most people frustration/mood swings is related to typical life and stress, if very intense it can be a sign of a number of challenges ranging from anxiety to a traumatic experience to something like Bipolar Disorder where a person's mood and energy might fly so high (mania) that one feels like they can do anything but often become frustrated when interrupted (note: there is a lot more to Bipolar Disorder than this and this is certainly not a diagnosis). Wish you well!","It sounds like you may be going through your first emotional ups and downs of your adolescent years.  First, I want to say that I find what you wrote about a teenager is very sad. It sounds like you may be lonely and your social circle is too small for you. Often in our teens we start to form social friendships that will become closer in nature over the years and sometimes they grow very close.  That said, you say other people get in your way. Perhaps this is about feeling trapped and unable to express yourself or get what you want, other than to be alone.  Some of what you write sounds familiar to me about growing up so fast. A lot of teens I know struggle with being able to talk to their parents about what is happening and feeling alone and misunderstood.  It's also common for teens to become very focused on very specific and exclusive friends, without understanding how that might be harming others.  These are hard things to figure out on our own!I wish you happiness in your life with friends and family.

   How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?","You can, for sure... and the first step is to believe you are worthy TO YOURSELF. Recognizing you are in a quest is already a big first step. Taking the time to start figuring out who you are is definitely the next... do so with SELF COMPASSION and kindness. Know this is a process and just look forward for what you might find.  I do recommend you find someone to talk to (there are many options out there that can fit the situation you are in), and I also recommend you start by giving yourself the importance to invest some time and effort in this quest. YOU DESERVE IT. There are some excellent TED Talks you can google, great books you can read, or even joining a yoga practice, team or some kind of hobby may help. Anything that shows yourself you are worthy of this effort. Have patience and start!!!! the answer is out there waiting for you. Asking these questions already set you on the right path.","In order to change your feelings of being worthless, you need to change the thoughts that lead to those feelings.If you're really serious about changing your life for the better, then you should consider seeing a therapist immediately.A therapist can help you to discover the specific thoughts that make you feel worthless and then can teach you how to challenge those thoughts and change them into more accurate ones.This type of process is called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and it is very effective.Here is another way to change your beliefs about yourself:Use positive self-talk and affirmations.Practice positive self-talk by listing your qualities and accomplishments and reminding yourself of your worth often during the day.Challenge negative thoughts with positive ones.If your mind says ""I'm worthless"", then tell yourself ""I'm valuable and worthy"".You can also use thought changing techniques to replace negative thoughts with more positive ones.Take steps towards improving your life in any small way possible.If you're still having suicidal thoughts you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or text HOME to 741741.",0.45017772912979126

Is there a reason no one sparks my interest?","Yes, of course there's a reason!There's always a reason for most dynamics!Depending on the nature and qualities of what changed as a result of your new self realizations, you may be more deeply affected by your new awareness than how you imagined these would go.Since you already are on the best road possible for yourself, since this resulted from your own introspection, keep trusting your own self work as to what develops and at what pace your relationship attraction qualities grow.","Hi there,I'm so sorry for your recent heartbreak. We don't know the full story, of course, but I am wondering if the relationship that ended was one where you were doing a lot of giving of yourself and not getting nearly as much back. You are the one who said you ""worked on yourself"" and that you ""did everything a healthy girlfriend does."" You're already on the right track -  you made changes that you're proud of - not because they allowed you to move on with someone, but because you cared about yourself. You are not responsible for someone else's happiness or attention...only for your own. If you are ok with being alone and happy, that's wonderful. I am not sure that you are - you said you ""looked for your boyfriend to make you happy."" It's tough not to feel needy and like our happiness depends on some other person...that is the hook that I think most of us get hooked on and then struggle with.I wonder where your interest comes from that you're saying ""no one peaks your interest."" It could be coming from somewhere deep down and your conscious mind is blocking it out. Or it could be coming from a lot of outside pressure (family, friends, etc.) to be in a relationship. Or it could just be a part of your self-talk that you're not ready to face. So the question isn't whether you are ready to date again, but instead, can you open yourself up to new possibilities without pressuring yourself or anyone else to be in a relationship with someone?",0.46061766147613525
"When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. She is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but I am afraid she is stressing too much. I’m afraid it’s going to break her. I don't know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal.","It may be helpful to register for a class you can take together. I would recommend mindful meditation or yoga, just the two of you. Something you find time for in a weekly basis. Yoga is amazing in learning mindfulness and reducing stress. I use yoga and mindful techniques when working with children and recommend it to parents to engage with their children. Hope this helps.","It is wonderful that you are so keen on your daughter's well being. From a practical standpoint, the very first step would be to consult with your daughter's pediatrician about this and describe exactly what you are hearing and observing.  From there you can both discuss whether or not a referral to someone specializing in health behavior, either a psychologist or counselor, would be helpful.In my counseling practice I work with parents and children who find themselves overwhelmed with high levels of anxiety. The good news is that it is possible to change that by learning better tools and strategies for managing your anxiety in a healthy way. This also includes learning to tolerate, or accept that there are uncomfortable or difficult feelings and that this is ok!  These skills can be taught and practiced and with a bit of patience, you daughter can learn ways to cope with her anxieties that would enable her to manage them and still perform well in school. It is also quite possible that she is experiencing anxiety, which has gone unnoticed or not diagnosed, that is actually preventing her from performing at her very best. She may be anxious about performance, but not really know what that feeling is. It takes someone to help her recognize what is going on, identify the ways she is coping with it (and not managing it well) and teach her effective coping strategies so that she can move forward with a more relaxed confidence and ease.",0.5068473219871521
"I'm fine when we start becoming intimate, but out of nowhere, I will get a flashback of what happened to me in the past. I start hysterically crying and freaking out when my boyfriend obviously has done nothing to hurt me.","Have you sought the support of a therapist really qualified in working through sexual trauma? It can take some work, but healing is possible. If you feel able to, it may also help to open a dialogue with your boyfriend about what you need from him when you have these flashbacks. Let him know what some helpful responses may be. ","This is something that can be really distressing and it sounds like it's creating a sense of disconnection from your boyfriend. We often have past relationships or experiences that seem to surface seemingly randomly, especially during times of great intimacy and emotional vulnerability. When these surface moments seem to have little or no connection to present moments you may experience feelings of overwhelm and disconnection. If this is something that is creating a barrier and hindering a secure attachment with your boyfriend, then it would be helpful to connect with a skilled therapist. In working with therapy, you'll learn how to safely sit with these difficult memories and work through them in a way that gives you the sense of safety and peace that you need in order to continue to grow closer with your boyfriend.",0.511121392250061
"I've hit my head on walls and floors ever since I was young. I sometimes still do it but I don't exactly know why,    I have anxiety and I had a rough childhood but now I'll start to hit my head and sometimes not realize it but I don't know how to stop or even why I'm doing it.    How can I help myself to change my behavior?","The best way to handle anxiety of this level is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor, and therapy to help you understand the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are causing the anxiety. This is not something that anyone should just “white knuckle” and try to get through on their own with no help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety. This takes a therapist trained in CBT. You will learn to recognize when and why you perform the behavior of hitting your head, help you deal with the underlying cause of this, and replace the behavior with a more positive behavior. You'll learn coping skills.You mention having a rough childhood. Anyone who has experienced trauma like this, especially long-term ongoing trauma from abuse of any kind, definitely does not need ""exposure therapy"", which is what is recommended for phobias. You need a therapist trained specifically in trauma informed therapy.You are on the right path by recognizing there is an issue and what it is. Good luck with your healing journey!","I don't know what is causing your behaviors right now.  I am guessing your head-hitting may be a way to deal with anxiety, depression, or some other deep need inside. Since I don't know what that is, I would encourage you to look at seeking help from a therapist or counselor.  I bet they would be able to help you understand your behaviors and give you tools to help manage them.  This may help you manage your anxiety and depression, and help you to feel more comfortable in your life.",0.44742584228515625
"My husband and I had our first threesome recently. Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me.    He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better, and now I'm craving more of it. But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling. Why am I feeling this way?","You need to have an honest conversation with each other about WHY you both want a threesome. Evaluate the status of your relationship with each other. Are you having issues? Fighting? Not feeling satisfied with each other? How has your sex life been with each other?  If there are any problems, insecurities, issues, introducing something like this may only make your relationship worse. Open relationships and threesomes rarely work out well. Sure, there are some who successfully live this lifestyle, but it only works when both people are completely secure in their relationship with each other, harbor no jealousies or insecurities, and aren't looking to someone else to satisfy needs that aren't getting met by their spouse. Let me say that again: This is not likely to work out well for you if either of you are insecure, jealous, or looking to have needs met by this other person that you aren't getting from your spouse. That empty feeling you're having - listen to it. Dig deep to find out where it is coming from. What thoughts are going through your head when you feel that way? You'll get the answer.The other thing that helps make something like this work is for both of you to listen and respect each other. If you don't like it that he paid more attention to the other girl, he needs to know that, and he needs to respect that.  If you're going to do it again, he needs to know what you're comfortable with and what you want. Set the limits before you're in the moment, before it's too late to take an action back. Turn it around and ask him what he would be comfortable with if it were a man instead of a woman.It is perfectly natural to be curious and want to experiment. A lot of people get that out of the way before settling down in a monogamous relationship. People who marry young and/or inexperienced may still feel that curiosity about things like that and want to experience them, but don't want to hurt their spouse. The REASON you are both doing this matters a lot. If there are problems in your relationship, this is likely to only make things worse.","It's wonderful that you were open to a threesome and the fact that you feel you handled it well. The first time you've done something like that is always tough on people, even if you know your partner is okay with it. You might be feeling a little bit vulnerable and not as secure as your husband does. Also, it can be quite a shock to your system the first time someone else is with you, especially with an added layer of vulnerability. Your body is craving attention as you are being vulnerable to your husband. The empty feeling might be a part of that. If it turns into a frequent feeling, then it would be good to talk with your husband and maybe seek counseling with a professional to help you to understand why this is happening. It's not normal to always feel empty during intimacy with another person who is being vulnerable.It will take time for your body to fully understand and adjust to this new sexual dynamic. It is unlikely that you will enjoy any sexual intimacy with him, but it could be less uncomfortable. I would give yourself and your husband the benefit of the doubt and the time to learn about your bodies. Perhaps you could check out some educational videos about threesomes on YouTube or some of the sex experts' sites like the Love doctor or myFTS.I hope you find some clarity and more happiness and confidence in your sex life.",0.47344547510147095
"I'm in my mid 20s with a husband and children. I love my family, but I feel like I've lost my identity, and I don't know who I am other than a mom and wife. At times, all I can think is what I gave up and how I feel unhappy and trapped, but I know I'd feel like worse without them. I loathe myself at times. I have an amazing life, so why can't I just enjoy it?","It is not easy being a wife and mother. You have shifted roles in your life. You went from having a career to focusing on your family. Transitioning can be hard, especially when we feel we gave something up that we really wanted. I want to acknowledge you for wanting to be the best wife and mother you can. I think it is great that you are self-aware and want to work on this.Feeling ""unhappy and trapped"" may also mean that you are  believing these negative thoughts are absolutely true. We have lots and lots of thoughts throughout the day. Sometimes we pay a lot of attention to some and some we ignore. Right now these thoughts are getting a lot of your attention and perhaps you are thinking because you are thinking them they are true.  Is it really true that you trapped? You also said that you have an amazing life. It doesn't sound like you are only having negative thoughts. You have some positive ones, too. However, you are giving a lot of weight to the negative thoughts, more weight than the positive ones.I also wonder if you are struggling with the fact that you are even having this thought. One thing that can be helpful is to recognize that you are having a thought, that it is a negative thought, that thinking it does not make it true, and to let it go. This is the basis for mindfulness work that can be really helpful. It is a great place for you to start so you can balance out your thoughts and emotions.Best of luck to you!","Hi Houston, It is wonderful that you are recognizing this feeling and recognizing that it isn't necessarily something to be ashamed of. It is common for women to experience feelings of a loss of personal identity after the birth of children and the establishment of family life. It's a fairly universal experience. It is likely that you have lost a part of yourself in the process of creating a family. It sounds like you may be feeling a loss of personal identity because you've spent so much energy on your husband and family that it's left little room for your own needs and goals. One step in the right direction would be to start by recognizing that you're happy in your marriage and happy to spend your time with your family. You said you loathe yourself for feeling this way, but I'd encourage you to see it as the opposite of loathing - compassion and kindness. Try asking yourself the following questions. What were you before you had children? What activities were you passionate about? What are your dreams? What has changed for you? What can you do to change things? I agree with the poster that the good news is that you have an amazing life. What needs to change is the way you think about your life. Try to look at it as if you were telling a friend about your happy and fulfilling life. One way you can start is to schedule some time for yourself. It doesn't have to be an expensive spa treatment or anything like that. Maybe you could hire a babysitter for a few hours and go to a yoga class. Maybe you can go for a walk, do some reading, or take a bath. The key is to use that time to be alone and focus on you. Start small and be kind to yourself. This is a big change, and you're already taking a huge step by recognizing it and wanting to do something about it. Good luck!",0.44317328929901123
I am going through a very hard time and I'm so depressed. My parents are getting a divorce and a lot of bad things are happening. I want to lull myself.,"It sounds like a tough time and it's normal to feel down when your family is going through a divorce or other hardship. There's a difference between feelings like sadness, discouragement, grief, loneliness and depression, though. Sadness is sadness and sometimes we have to go through a grieving or other process, that is a normal reaction to events in our lives. Depression, on the other hand, is more about being stuck. Lulling yourself with self-care sounds like a healthy response and a way to give yourself support. So as to the uncomfortable but healthy part of your feelings, do the best you can to put names to it and share with a trusted other person. You will find comfort. The part of your situation that's depression -- feeling stuck, not able to get out of bad, concentrate, changes in sleeping and eating, loss of enjoyment in living, poor hygiene, feelings of hopelessness, that's different. First step, identify your own symptoms of depression. If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself, tell someone. If you're not sure, you can try 800-lifenet or other support line to get feedback. First aid for depression includes: daily care and feeding, good sleeping and eating, lots of exercise--even when you don't feel like it-- healthy socializing, and focusing on talking to yourself in a positive way. If you aren't able to move yourself out of your depression,  work with a professional to make short-term goals and get some support. You may also talk to your doctor or psychiatrist about trying an anti-depressant to give you a little lift while you go through a rough patch.Best wishes,Karen","Hi, I'm so sorry for what you are experiencing.

"I've got so much anger. I don't know how to control myself. My girlfriend screams at me all the time, and sometime I don't know how to deal with life. I'm very depressed and angry. I feel lost.","Hi Campbell River, You say you have anger but you don't mention how it shows. Or maybe it doesn't. Are you aggressive with your girlfriend? Since you mention depression, I wonder if you're bottling it all up somewhere instead of letting it show at all. If this is the case, I admire your ability to not lash out at someone who's hurting you. However, if they are totally  unexpressed, anger turn inward and shift into depression. When she yells at you, what do you do? Is this the moment that you feel the most angry? I wouldn't be surprised; anger is a normal response to someone yelling at you. Something about anger...it's often there to cover up our more vulnerable emotions. Under the anger I wonder if you feel worthless, powerless, scared, unloved. Part of the trick to reducing anger is identifying those other emotions and expressing them. You say you don't know how to deal with life, and I think maybe you mean you don't know how to deal with emotions. Lots of people don't! This is confusing for most of us. What am I feeling? Why is it so strong? I'm afraid to express it for fear of hurting someone (or falling apart, or feeling alone...). How do I know what to express and what to be quiet about? These are all great questions to ask yourself, and a qualified therapist can help you sort it all out and support you in your growth. I wish you well!","Hello, I understand the feeling of being angry about something that is outside your control. Many people are struggling with this in the modern era of increased anxiety and depression, where we are constantly bombarded with information, expectations, and so many challenges that are difficult to manage or escape. One option is to accept that no one is in control of those things. We are only in charge of ourselves - our thoughts, our behaviors, our reactions. If you can let go of the feeling that there is some power that you do not have, then you are free from the torment of trying to change the world (or the direction of other people's behavior) in which you do not have control. As I teach many others, the less that we try to control the more free we feel. I would encourage you to continue to practice self-care, whether it be in your spiritual life, within yourself and your body, or in your relationships and your world. We need to take care of our physical selves before we can take care of others. My best wishes for you. In the meantime, some self-care ideas could be eating healthy and getting enough sleep.     I am also able to offer online sessions via video conferencing at a reduced rate.     http://www.therapistsofnewengland.com/counselor/dr-carolina-morales/",0.38636961579322815
Does counseling really do anything that can help people?,"Hi!  Great question.  I believe counseling does help people! Of course, I am a therapist, so I would think that! :)  Seriously - I think therapy and counseling allow us to understand ourselves, our motivations and the things that bring us happiness and discontent.  Therapy can create opportunities to try new skills and enhance positive attributes that are already present in someone.  I like to think of therapy as an unbiased ""aerial view"" of our lives. Someone outside can often help us notice things we might otherwise miss. Hope this helps!","Counseling can help people in various different ways and to different degrees depending on the specific issue and the type of counseling. Counselors have had specialized training in techniques to help people with certain issues.Counseling can give you a person to talk to, a new way of looking at something or someone. It can also be done in a safe environment, which can be hard to do in your own life without someone around. Counselors, being people, all have their own values and beliefs.

"My mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back, and I can't seem to forgive her. I want to say that it's okay, but I can't. I feel like even if I did forgive her, I wouldn't be able to say it to her face.","How someone feels when they forgive another, is at peace with themselves and their understanding of what went wrong, who was responsible for what in the situation, and clarity on their own motivation, actions, emotions including pain, regret, resentment, sadness.These steps ideally allow a new door to open in order to develop new paths in the existing relationship or accept that this will not be possible due to either person's way of handling themselves.The long answer would be that you're not yet through with this process.I commend you on being truthful with yourself about yourself.You're on the right track by expecting to feel resolved when you've reached resolution, and not before.Finding patience with the unpredictable amount of time needed to thoroughly examine all the details of the incidents you mention, sometimes is a frustration of its own.Keep up your good work of knowing your own life.It is a worthwhile endeavor!","It sounds as if what you're feeling could be a bit of grief for the brokenness that resulted from what happened. Forgiveness is a process of releasing feelings for those whose actions you feel you cannot let go of. The challenge may be in what you feel she is ""paying back"" by having to say your forgiveness. It sounds as if there may be things for you to do for yourself in letting this go so that you have the energy and ability to have the relationship you really would like to have with her. This often requires both letting go of what you can't control, which may be what you're doing for her, and having your needs met. It may be helpful to start with these first steps and see where they lead you. I hope you find some peace and understanding soon.",0.4489747881889343
"I’m in my early 20s. My ex’s parents are friends with them and have told them bad things about me. I left my ex due to an abusive situation, and they are making me look like I was the bad one.","Maybe you can talk with your partner about this first look at the different elements of a possible conversation in the future. If you are at a place where you are willing or able to disclose the reason that you left your ex, that could be one element of the discussion, but it doesn't have to be.I don't know how long we have been together with your current partner, but perhaps his or her parents would see you for who you are and make their own opinions over time. That may be a discussion to have with them as well.Hopefully your partner will be a good sounding board before these conversations.","Sounds like an uncomfortable position for you to be in.How would you feel about telling your ex that the actions of your former in-laws don't reflect you and that their behavior does not have merit, even if the actions you were accused of didn't occur?In working through the specifics of this situation, it may be helpful for you to speak with a therapist who could help you to clarify what your true feelings, what your own values are, and whether your values are changing, and if so what their implications are.",0.42490124702453613
How does a person start the counseling process?,"I'd recommend looking on psychologtoday.com, reading the bio's of potential therapists who you think you would relate best with, then contact them through e-mail or on the phone.",Therapy is an excellent thing to do for yourself. You mentioned that you have experienced anxiety and depression in the past. You may consider keeping a journal of triggers that cause the anxiety to arise and how you feel and react to these situations. Sometimes by identifying what stresses us out we can better manage and accept it. Therapy is also a good place to start. You have done a wonderful thing for yourself and are well on your way to living a happier and healthier life!,0.47337448596954346
"I find that I imagine things sexually, and I hate it because it puts strain on my relationship. I feel helpless and guilty. I want it to go away, and I want to make my woman happy again.","It is completely understandable that you would like to find a way to make these intrusive thoughts go away, however, your feeling that you can't control having these thoughts is accurate. It's also understandable that you would feel helpless and guilty, given that you see how these thoughts are effecting your relationship, though I would encourage you to go easy on yourself and remember that you aren't choosing to have these thoughts. I'm sure that if there was a switch to turn them off, you would flip it.There is no magic technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away, however, therapy may still have a lot to offer. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into where these thoughts are coming from and develop new ways of relating to them so that they do not leave you feeling as helpless and guilty and can be more present with your partner. Though there is no guarantee that the thoughts will go away, this may also be a result of work with a therapist. Either way, you may be able to find a way to deal with the thoughts and show up in your relationship in a way that will be satisfying to you and your partner.","Intrusive thoughts can feel upsetting.  They can be very real and feel as though they are happening in the moment.  It can be hard to think our way out of having intrusive thoughts, they are often the opposite of what you would naturally think to do.  As the thoughts are very intrusive, they are likely to be very confusing and can make you feel like you are going crazy.  Therapy can be very helpful in working through these types of intrusive thoughts.  Some types of therapy are cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and Exposure Response Prevention (ERP) which can often be used to help with obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours.  I am a licensed professional counselor based in Ottawa and I do online counselling as well.  You can find more information on my website at www.counsellorottawa.com.",0.4882845878601074
"I am a female, and I am afraid of having sex. I am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced. I think he thinks I'm not a virgin. I am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body. I don't want my partner to think differently of me because I am afraid of having sex.","As hard as it may be to do this, since all the media and marketing of how an ideal person looks and performs sexually, surrounds us, keep in mind that the images presented in order to sell movies and almost any product, is meant to trigger fantasies.No one is a fantasy, we are all real and unique.  We can be influenced to believe that being a fantasy is better than being who each of us is, genuinely.Your partner may be much more accepting of your body and your level of sexual experience, than you are of yourself!Sex within a relationship means the two people want to have with the other one, not because they have ideal bodies and expertise, but because the person wants to make love to the one whom they love.When you are in a loving relationship, part of this includes talking about sensitivities and insecurities.  Having a conversation gives the chance to know that you are accepted for who you are, not how closely you resemble a made up idea meant to persuade people to buy items.","This kind of fear comes from a place of feeling inadequate. If you are satisfied with your appearance, then your partner will, too. However, if you are worried and unhappy with how you look, then you would be concerned for a partner's opinion of you. I don't like to teach patients ""dos and dont's"" as it takes away their own agency. But, you may want to consider these questions to help you gain clarity:1. What thoughts go through your mind when you think about being intimate with your partner?2. What is it that causes the fear?3. If you could see yourself being intimate with your partner, what are you anticipating?Is there a specific thing you imagine about having sex that makes you afraid? (ie. Embarrassment. Shame. Fear of hurting your partner)Is there something you imagine your partner is going to say about your body, or you might say about yourself?Once you discover where the fear comes from you can either get yourself more comfortable in a situation where you may be sexual with your partner or practice relaxing behaviors to help minimize your anxiety around the sexual interaction. Also, communicating with your partner about the anxiety you feel can help alleviate this as well. If the anxiety persists, it may also be helpful to consider working with a therapist who specializes in sex therapy. They can offer different techniques to manage your anxiety, and also help you understand how to communicate about sex with your partner.",0.3892236351966858
"I never feel like myself. I can’t even think straight anymore. I start stuttering and I can’t remember anything. I always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with, what feels like, someone else. I don’t know why I feel this way, but I hate it.","What you are describing sounds like it may be a form of dissociation. Dissociation is our mind's way of disconnecting us from aspects of our experience in an attempt to protect us in overwhelming situations. It also sounds like you are noticing anxiety in certain situations. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into these experiences, learn skills for coping with anxiety and reconnecting with yourself, and alleviate these symptoms over time.","Anxiety, depression, and other mental illnesses can lead to a feeling of dissociation, such as not being able to remember who you really are. In fact, some psychological approaches help to “re-learn” who you really are when there are dissociations. In this sense, you sound as if you may be suffering from some sort of depression that is not getting the treatment you need. Often, if your depression is not managed well, depression can lead to dissociation from reality, i.e., you begin to feel as if your own body and mind are not really your own. If this is the case, you should definitely seek the counsel of a therapist immediately. While there is no single treatment that all people who suffer depression will respond to, it is certainly worth trying the various treatments and different medication classes, so as to not give up too soon. A psychotherapist can also help you find the medication that best serves your purpose for helping you to heal from depression. I would recommend the National Helpline to find mental health providers in your area.

"My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the ""straight and narrow"" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that I'm not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others.    His insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","You are right that his insecurities are at the root of the issue.  You cannot change that for him.  He will have to do the work to handle those emotions on his own.  What you can do is reassure him in whatever ways possible, but always recognizing that you can't ""fix"" this for him.  When I work with people who struggle with their partner's past experiences, I always frame it like this:  Everything that you've experienced has resulted in you being the person you are today.  The person they claim to love.  If you had not gone through some of those experiences, you would not be in the position you're in now, ready to commit to him and know that you're satisfied with that.  Just as when bad things happen to us, we have to find a way to appreciate the lessons learned your fiance has to accept that you're the person you are today because of what you have gone through.  Celebrate that you have moved through that and have landed in this perfect position with him!Hope that helps, Allison","Your fiancé’s behaviors are hurting him more than anyone. He is suffering from an insecurity. Your partner is being mean and unkind toward you. If you want to end the relationship, then his insecurity is of no concern to you.   If you want to keep the relationship, you need to have a serious discussion with your fiancé and say he needs to stop being mean to you and to start being kind to you. He needs to apologize for his horrible treatment.     Then he needs to be patient and kind and gentle with you as you learn how to trust again.   He needs to be patient with you as you try to understand what is causing him to act this way and start showing you your vulnerability with the same kindness that you offer to him.  Then he needs to get help from a therapist.  This situation is not one where you can rescue your partner. You can only be his partner, not his therapist.  You should not expect that by being patient and supportive of your partner, that he will become a better man.

"How do I make myself happy without the people who made me happy? Now that they’re gone, I feel sad. It’s been two months now but I seem to be unable to stay okay and independent.","It sounds like you have been feeling pretty down, since the loss of a relationship, and you're wondering how to be happy by yourself. Intimacy is a very natural human desire and at the same time learning to enjoy ourselves, even when we are alone, can strengthen our ability to lead a satisfying life in and out of relationship. Working with a therapist, you may be able to gain insight into how you show up in your relationships with yourself and others and discover more fulfilling ways to do so.","If you are still close with your friends and they are not going away, then it is not your responsibility to make yourself happy.   Friends have the responsibility to make you happy and vice versa.  It may be that you are happy in their absence and you simply need to get to know yourself more.  There's nothing wrong with having friends...in fact, quite the opposite!  Try not to let their problems effect yours.

"I'm a young adult woman, and I have trouble finding my true identity being at home. This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I don't know why. I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldn't like it. My parents are very religious—they're Christians. We did things every time he'd come over to my house. We didn't have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we'd watch movies by ourselves.
   One day, my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. As soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. They were both aggravated. They told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. They said he wanted me for sex and he's not a Christian. I took their advice and broke up with him. Once we broke up for about a month, I decided to get back together with him a little after school started. My parents found out eventually, and I decided to not listen this time. I would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and God totally forbids him. I would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually I would just never listen to my parents. They're always yelling at me about how I shouldn't date this boy. I felt too old to listen to them. Now I'm kind of just stuck. Is the real me religious? Have I been brainwashed by him? I don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think I'm deceiving because of it. They threatened me that if I'm still with him, I can't do track and they won't support me. They've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. They say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. I'm actually very happy with him. They also say I'm living a separate life at home than I am at school. They say they want what's best for me and love me because they adopted me.","What a tough situation you must be in, feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you. I would say the first thing you want to do is (if you haven't already), have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents, telling them how you feel and letting them know what you need from them. If communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward. You, unfortunately, will not be able to change your parent's feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from the relationship you have with your parents. It always helps to try and see things from another angle. You might want to, for example, try and understand your parent's perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset. Validating other's feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively. Are you living with your parents and do they support you? If so, are you willing to give that up should you decide to not follow their rules? Know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply. Your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper. Not everyone will always approve of the choices we make and sometimes we need to be okay with that. Best of luck to you.","I know you've gone through something very painful. It sounds like your parents really want the best for you and would like to be happy about this relationship. I imagine you're hurting a lot right now because you may not feel the same and maybe want to be happy for yourself. I imagine you're confused about where you stand and what you truly want. I would encourage you to consider talking with your boyfriend or with another friend or family member that you feel could listen without judging or making your situation worse. When we try and talk with people we are angry with we often hear exactly what we want to hear, and we're not really hearing what they're saying. Sometimes having another person to explain yourself to and hear their advice is helpful. The more you argue yourself against your parents or someone that you truly do not like, the harder it will be to sort through your feelings. Maybe having someone who will help you listen to yourself is a good start. The good news is that you have plenty of time to sort things out and see where you really stand. Also it sounds like your track team may want to step in as well. I'm not sure how old you are but it does sound like you've already achieved great things at track and your parents need to understand that your relationship could be a priority for you, while also meeting your track goals.",0.3993995189666748
"I have been with my best friend for over a year, and we have had a beautiful baby girl. We were in love, and I still love her dearly. I am in my late teens and so is she. She says she has lost her connection with me. She is talking to a random guy that she says is just someone to talk to. But she says she still loves me. I'm very hurt and confused.","Congrats on having your daughter!Have you told your partner about your feelings of ""hurt and confused""?This is one possible way of opening a conversation about the different ways you each feel about one another and whether either of you would like changing or continuing to live together, in light of the change in emotional connection.The first step of having a dialogue about a relationship is being clear on what you are feeling, what you are willing to contribute to the relationship and what you would like having in return from your partner.Ask your partner if she is willing to have a conversation on these topics.  Then, allow some time so each of you is clear about their own expectations and what is possible to offer the other.This is a fairly complex process and very often is difficult to keep on track without outside help to keep the discussion focused.It is normal for emotions to override our logic when discussing matters we care about deeply.If the conversations don't go very far, or if your partner has no interest in talking, stick with your own interest to more fully understand matters.Interview some therapists to find one whom you feel helps you clarify and find direction for yourself about this situation.","You and your girlfriend seem to have a lot of difficulty getting clear communication from each other. One of the things you could do is tell her that you don't understand why she is ""talking to a random guy,"" or how would you describe the nature of the communication you are having with him, and would she describe to you that in some way in order that you can understand how she is feeling? Your relationship is not described as a sexually active one, and you can be confident that you want to be with her, not someone else. You love her and you value what you have, but she sounds like she feels somewhat adrift and not as confident in the direction of your relationship. What does she say about him (the random guy)? Is this guy emotionally available and capable of friendship with her? If he is a great confidante, then it's a fair way of developing a friendship with a new person. In addition, can she be honest about what it is she wants in a relationship, and if she isn't able to get these desires met in a relationship with you, then what is it about the random guy that appeals to her? If it is just someone to talk to, it's hard to determine if there is a connection or not without that knowing who this person is. Also, have you considered communicating this directly? So often, we become defensive and get a feeling that people have already judged our motives. It is difficult to communicate effectively when there is a strong sense of anger, or guilt, or feeling judged. She and you would benefit from counseling. I suggest that you both seek professional help and discuss your feeling about your relationship's future.",0.4476271867752075

Any info would be good.,"Sounds like you are dealing with a lot within your self which is causing you great pain.  I would suggest that first you get a full physical evaluation to make sure that you are ok physically.  Then getting a mental evaluation as well from a psychiatrist.  Seeing both would help rule out any physically or psychologically causes to your symptoms.    After getting these evaluations, your physician should be able to help guide you on what treatments would be the best to help with your everyday challenges your are facing.  Whether treatment includes medication and/or psychotherapist would be discussed.  Please consider doing both immediately so you can have the live you want everyday you wake up.","The fact that you came to the place of posting here, the fact that I am willing to give my time, and the fact that you are concerned enough that you did not try to do this on your own are all positive signs. You didn't describe any physical symptoms in the question you ask, so I'm going to assume that you are okay. It is not unusual for a person to feel alone or feel like they do not belong. If you are concerned that you are not feeling okay you need to talk to someone about this. But I'm not sure if you feel okay or not...it is very common for us to misinterpret our own internal thoughts and feelings. The good news is that you are learning more about yourself right now...and so will the other people in your life when they see your efforts to learn to understand the way you are experiencing things. So your best bet may be to keep learning about yourself... and you will find that you will become more confident as you become more sure of yourself.",0.4689091444015503
"Last year, I just always felt hopeless. I don't have a great relationship with my sister. I lost my mother recently, and that really added to my sadness. My sister always brings up how I was never close to my mother.","Wow what a painful journey you have been in for a long time. Death and grief bring up so many painful reminders of relationships--what they could have been, never were, and what was lost. With death of a family member the family often falls apart for a while... or longer. I hope you can find some support for you and your pain that was occurring before your mom's passing. I also hope you can find someone to help you set boundaries with your sister so you can have your time (as long as you need) to heal from losing your mom and then later figure out how to interact with your sister. ","I'm sorry for your loss.  Grief tends to magnify existing problems, so it's possible your sister's comment about your relationship with your mom was an example of one.  You're certainly not alone, although you and your sister may not be aware of that fact.  After a loss, we tend to isolate from others and can withdraw into the past, which may lead to some hurtful exchanges we do not need.  We often re-live times we feel hurt or unsupported.  The good news is that you may also be able to re-live times you were supported and loved.  In addition, through therapy, we learn coping skills which could help you re-write some of those painful memories and create new ones.   This can be difficult on your own.  In addition, I want to encourage you to reach out to friends or family members whom you trust.  Grief affects us so profoundly that we often have a hard time recognizing that it is affecting others and they need to know that we are not acting as our normal selves.  If you do reach out, expect some support which is often difficult to hear.  If your sister refuses or is unable to provide you that, consider talking with a professional therapist about what to do next.",0.5399593114852905
"I was anxious to go to middle school. I was afraid of what people might say about me, so when school started, I wasn't acting like myself. I was quiet, which I'm usually not. I didn't talk to anybody and didn't have any friends. Then a few years later, my grandma died. I really became depressed and stop going to school for a little. I hated myself and still do. I just need help. I need someone to care for me. I need someone to show that they care.","I agree; you need more care and support. No one deserves to feel alone, or like they hate themselves. We're all wonderful, imperfect, complicated people and we're at our best when we're all helping each other. I'm glad you wrote this question, because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes. I can tell that you're smart, because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connected...you ""not being yourself"", and then how you felt when your grandma died. When Grandma died, you needed and deserved extra love and support, but the people around you didn't seem to give it to you, maybe. My hunch is that they wanted to, but that they didn't know how much you needed it, or what you needed exactly. The older you get, the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need. Maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature, but that's how it works. When you started middle school, it sounds like you changed; you got more quiet, right? That must have felt weird, to not be acting like yourself. It sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldn't like you. Fear can be silly. So then, fear got you to not show yourself, and when we don't show ourselves, people can't see who we are; they don't know us as well and then they don't know what we need and they can't care for us as well either. Fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you. It does that to a lot of us. So, where you're at right now is because of what fear did to you, and also because when Grandma died you were already isolated so people couldn't see your pain and know that you needed support. There's a simple solution, but you'd have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say ""Get off my back!"". ""You're not helping me by telling me lies."" Can you be brave enough to go back to your old, louder, self? If you talk to the people closest to you...tell them what you think and how you feel, then they'll be able to give you the care that you want and deserve. I wish you well as you try this!","I understand that you need to find someone you can talk with that wants to help you. I think it helps to start with a diagnosis. I'd suggest seeing a primary care physician for a physical exam and discussion of any symptoms you are having, such as change in appetite, change in sleep, or feeling anxious all the time. A general anxiety condition or even an anxiety disorder could very likely be what you need to deal with. So, find someone to help you identify whether there is a mental health issue at play. If you're concerned about the ""depressed"" part of your question, then I suggest you see someone who can give you a diagnosis or help you to identify what you are feeling. It would be great for both the reason that you need help as well as for your own mental health benefit. Your feelings are valid and your health is important. You can find a provider using online directories. You can call 800-433-8778 to get access to a hotline and ask questions about mental health. Find an adult or mentor you trust and talk to them, but please be aware that the person may not know what to do to help you with your symptoms. You don't have to go through this alone.",0.4639163613319397

Some people are not into keeping all the people they know constantly connected. Others need more interactions than you do and feel better when they hear back from the people they message. Some people do not want to be kept up on every single thing you have going on, since they have people they do talk to more frequently. And then of course are the people who use texting as a way of keeping themselves connected. It can be a way of feeling close to others, rather than getting close to them directly. It can also be a way of maintaining some sort of power over the people they do this to, since some people are more sensitive about how they use their time to talk to others than they are with the way people talk to them.  If you're using these apps as a way of staying in contact with people who you care about, then don't worry about the fact that they don't always answer your messages. They are not obligated to do that. Just don't let the fact that you don't always hear back from others, lead you to think that you are not a worthwhile person to be connected to.

"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","Absolutely not. It sounds like you have significant trauma and it will continue to impact your depression until it is dealt with. Everybody has issues, though some more traumatic than others yet it is best to just start somewhere. I would encourage you to begin counseling and work through some of your history at your own pace in order to begin to impact and reduce your depressive symptoms.","No, not at all! We all have past trauma, physical trauma, emotional trauma, and so on.  Your husband, a breast cancer diagnosis, your history of sexual abuse, and your insomnia are all important information for a therapist to know if they are going to be able to best help you.  A therapist can help you to sort through all of these and other life events and find ways to cope and not only be more present in life but enjoy it, too.  If your therapist does not think that they can be of assistance to you, they should refer you to someone else who can help.  It is not your fault that these things happened to you.  It is common for people with such histories to have anxiety and low self esteem.",0.4617937207221985
"I'm in my late teens and live with my dad. The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I won't want to talk to them for days or even weeks.    Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.
   Are they right, am I depressed?","I'm alway wary of assigning a term to a feeling, as often that term becomes more important than the feeling itself. From the very little that you have written, it is clear that you are going through something that has made you extremely low, affected your self-esteem and motivation, limits your enjoyment of formerly pleasurable activities and affects your feelings of self-worth. All of these are aspects of being depressed, though you can be depressed and still not have ""depression"". Counseling is definitely a place where you can go and sort out why you have had such a sudden a drastic change to your mood. Sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine, losses or significant disappointments. Talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way, but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the future. I do hope that you will reach out. Feeling alone can be harmful over long periods of time, as it can stop us from seeking out the support we need.","First, your dad isn't wrong.  It's normal for people to go through times of wanting to be around friends or even being the friend with whom they are comfortable.Then, I'd say you could be depressed or not. Depression is often times a difficult term to come to terms with because we hear it so often.  However, depression is a mental illness and can affect the most active, fun loving and generally fun people around us.  In regards to the social part, depression can lead to a desire not to be around people, which also affects your friend relationships. I wouldn't say this means you're depressed, but these symptoms sometimes occur in people who are suffering from depression.Another thing I think about is feeling worthless or not being up to the task of accomplishing things.  This again can cause our mood to be affected.  However, depression comes from low self esteem, which will then cause you to believe you are not a worthwhile person.I'd encourage you to meet with a doctor to discuss these matters.",0.4162340760231018
"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?","This is a great question. Finding the right therapist can be tricky because you don't really know how someone will be like until you meet them. A few ways to prescreen are to:- Visit the therapist's website, psychologytoday profile, social media, etc...- Have a phone call with the therapist prior to your first appointmentOnce you meet your therapist it is important to be clear with your wishes and expectations. We are trained in helping you thrive in your life but we cannot mind read so if you don't tell us, we won't know. Don't be shy about what you like and what you don't like. A good therapist will listen to your needs, process them with you, and create a customized plan that works for you and your life. A good therapist will also not take anything you say (even criticism) personally. Coming to therapy is hard and often times you might not want to go. What makes a good therapist is someone who understands this and tries to make you feel as comfortable as possible while you address uncomfortable topics.","One of the best indicators of a good therapist is that you feel comfortable in their office. As you build a relationship with your therapist it is possible that you will feel as though you can bring out the less desirable aspects of yourself. It takes a skillful therapist to do this without making you feel that you don't have the ability to handle it.  Being comfortable with your therapist will likely feel somewhat easy, while being comfortable with what you experience in therapy will feel a little different. At first you will likely feel out of place, as if you are sitting in a chair rather than sharing yourself with someone who understands you. It may even feel awkward at times but will gradually become more natural as you become more familiar with your therapist. The more open you are with your therapist as you discuss your experiences, the more comfortable you will become with sharing your experience and this is due to the quality of your relationship. You may also feel that you have a good relationship with your therapist if you find that you are not feeling judged by your therapist when you bring up issues from the past or talk about an illness or a fear. Being able to share sensitive information with your therapist is a key to improving your emotional health. It also means the therapist is skilled enough to provide you with a safe space in order to do this.  For more information about being comfortable with your therapist, please go to: www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-secrets-therapy",0.47656315565109253
"Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  Am I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal.","You need to find an outlet. Someone to talk to. Your dad or someone who loves your mother as well is someone ideal. But anyone could help. Just look to someone for help. If you can't find anyone who you think will listen, talk to your mom. It can help greatly just to get the words out. Tell her how you feel about her passing, but then also about everything else. Talk to her about your day. Tell her about happy things. I don't know if you're a religious person, or where you believe she is now, but no matter what you can talk to her.","This is a common struggle that you will find among many religions and beliefs systems. The fear of death and eternity is very difficult to get past. Even if you live in a culture where your faith teaches that you will live forever, this may not help you feel better about being able to handle the challenge of eternity.If you find that thoughts about living forever in heaven is more scary than not being alive at all, then it may be time to seek professional help.If you have no strong religious beliefs, then it may be even more important to look for help.I recommend seeing your own primary care provider as soon as you can. Mental health workers can prescribe medication for anxiety and/or depression. Once you feel more stable, you may seek out counseling to help you sort out your fears and find better ways to handle them.",0.4303920865058899
"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","Yes, it is very normal to cry during a therapy appointment.  When you meet with a counselor, you are opening yourself up and sharing very vulnerable sides of yourself.  Through this deep introspection, emotions (sometimes unexpected) can come out and this is completely okay and very healthy.  Research has shown that crying reduces pain by releasing oxytocin and endorphins and reduces stress through the release of stress reduction hormones.","Absolutely, you are normal!  It is quite normal to cry during therapy because it's a process of emotional release and letting go of what no longer serves you.  The therapist is here to support you through that release and will not judge.    Crying and vulnerability are parts of the healing process.",0.4834468960762024

"My ex-fiancé (whom I am still seeing) left me because of the pressure from all three of his teenage daughters. They wanted him to try to work it out with their mom (his ex-girlfriend of 20 years). He and I split three months ago, but I have been seeing him pretty regularly despite the fact that he is living back with his ex-girlfriend and kids. He is ""co-existing"" for the kids and fighting all the time with his ex-girlfriend. His daughters don’t want their dad with me because my two boys (grown adults and on their own now) had bad reputations and issues with drugs. His daughters say it is embarrassing for him to be with me. He and I had an absolutely amazing relationship and connect on so many levels. He is getting a lot of pressure from his family and his longtime friends to ""do the right thing"" and stay with his ex-girlfriend for the kids. He says he wants me to wait. We were going get married last year. He bought me a $1000 dress, we had invitations made, and everything set up, but then his girls told him they'd never speak to him again if he married me. He says he’s trying to mend his relationship with them.","Hello. It seems you are in a set of circumstances that are highly uncomfortable for you. Do you feel those circumstances are healthy? Do you find pleasure being in such a place of uncertainty? Why do you continue to be in this situation? Without meaning to appear that I might be lacking in compassion, you do have the option to leave the connection completely if the harm it is doing is more that the pleasure it brings you. Is there a benefit to being in this relationship? Do you consider this situation to be for your highest good? Is it healthy to be involved in something that is not likely healthy or perhaps could even be seen as dysfunctional? In truth, only you can decide the answers to these very important questions. I would encourage you to think of who benefits by being in this situation, and how you might be able to find happiness in other relationships that are healthier and more positive. In my clinical view based on what I read, this particular relationship does not carry the joy I am sure you want, nor the healthy interactions you would expect in a functional romantic engagement with another person.Beating yourself up about potentially wasting all this time waiting for the other person to come around will not serve a positive purpose. It likely will only lower your self-esteem. There is a time to wait to see how things develop, and a time to move on to other experiences. You are the one to make that choice, but I would encourage you to connect with your inner higher self, for the most clear answer. Chances are, you already know the answer, you just need to embrace it. Getting in touch with a counselor in your area can also help ferret out some of the deeper issues that you might not have felt comfortable expressing here.","Your ex's girls can't make his decision for him!  They are the ones who created this situation in the first place. They say they won't be able to cope with his relationship with you. They also say they are not going to be able to cope with their dad's relationship with their mother. I wish I had an answer that said they would, but unfortunately they won't.  He is the one who gets to decide whether he will make a change or not. I would ask yourself if you want him to change or if you just want to be with him.  Because if you care about this man, you need to consider his well-being and his daughters' well-being.  I know it hurts, but it could just be a matter of time.  Right now, your husband needs to be the priority because that is the man who will be with you for a long time. You deserve a stable love with someone who doesn't put as much pressure on you as his family.  It might also help you to talk to a counselor.",0.39867180585861206
"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?","Finding the right therapist can be difficult, especially if you've never tried it before. Things to consider are location, availability and what specifically are you looking for. Some practitioners specifically only work with a certain type of issue (i.e eating disorders, adolescents, anger management, life transitions, anxiety...etc) and others can work with a variety of concerns. As far as training your therapist, you can't. You simply let them know what you are looking to work on or what you think may be an issue for you. Depending on the way they practice(their style of working with clients) is how they will then decide to make a treatment plan that works best for you. You can always ask them their specialty practice population, the problems they generally help others with and what type of mental health provider they are (Psychologist, social worker, licensed mental health counselor).","The great news is that you have the power to know if you are a good fit with your therapist. If you feel comfortable, ask your therapist if you can discuss a few things about how you would like to work with them. This could be that you'd like more focus on certain topics, or perhaps you need them to work slower or faster. That may not be appropriate to discuss in the first session but you may be able to ask your therapist if you can talk about this at some point or during your next session. Your first session is an introduction.  If you find that you don't feel comfortable with your therapist you may want to consider finding someone else.  It's also important that you feel understood, heard and supported by your therapist. It is also a part of a good therapist-client relationship that you will feel comfortable in a way that you can be open, honest, talk about what is really bothering you and trust that you will not be judged.",0.45981866121292114
"I have terrible anxiety and depression. I've tried various therapists and pills, but nothing's helped.","Is it possible you simply didn't mix well with the particular therapists with whom you've worked?   If this is possible, interview a therapist before  starting therapy.   Then you will be choosing a therapist who feels compatible with your way of seeing yourself and your life.Also, therapy isn't for everyone.Read about the different healing modalities and see if one of these speaks to your interest in feeling better.What matters most is finding among all the legitimate healing methods, what you believe will be effective.","Anxiety and depression are incredibly common. There is a lot of research on the various ways to treat them, so you are likely going to find something that works for you. I am glad you have tried a couple of different therapists and several different medicines. It sounds like you are diligent in trying to find a natural way to help yourself. It can be frustrating to not find a treatment that really helps. It sounds like you are very proactive in seeking ways to feel better. As you pursue other potential ways of treating your symptoms, I would recommend you continue the therapy work you are doing now. Therapy and medication are most effective when combined, and sometimes each treatment can really enhance the other. Therapy will allow you to learn more about yourself and develop coping skills for your symptoms. Medication may help reduce your symptoms in the short-term, but may not allow you the time and opportunity to truly learn about yourself, understand your triggers and develop the coping skills that would help you in the long-term. Once you have explored a few more ways of treating your symptoms, check back with your therapist and ask if he/she has any thoughts on further treatment options.

"I feel angry, anxious, and depressed. The PTSD I suffer is from a past relationship.","If the symptoms are to the extent that they are affecting your ability to function, you may want to consider seeking treatment. PTSD, anxiety, and depression all typically respond well to treatment if provided by a trained clinician. Common types of treatment for PTSD that you may want to look into include Cognitive Processing Therapy or EMDR. The nice things about Cognitive Processing Therapy is that it is time limited and only lasts 17 sessions typically. ","Hi there, I can certainly see how these things may be connected. Being in an abusive relationship is hard enough, but when you're no longer in that relationship it can be very hard to overcome the aftermath. I'm glad that you are aware that there may be connections between your experiences and how you feel right now. It helps to learn and understand the reasons behind your feelings. We all experience things in our lives and a lot of them can make us feel better or worse. Learning how you feel and what the cause is makes the emotions feel less overwhelming. If the depression feels very deep or overwhelming then I would definitely encourage you to speak with someone who can help you with that. You don't have to go through this all by yourself. As for coping, try making this a focus. Sometimes we become so focused on what we are feeling that we just ignore other things in our lives. Find activities which you use to cope in the past when you felt depressed and anxious and start to do those again. Start small and set small goals for yourself such as walking around the block or making breakfast or getting out of bed, and once you've achieved that goal and feel good, set another one. The point is to set small goals so that you experience feelings of being successful and that boosts your confidence. If you feel overwhelmed then set bigger goals, but it's very important that you have small goals that you can achieve so that you can feel victorious. If you are no longer with the relationship you may still be experiencing anger at your ex or even yourself. Try to let this go. You are not responsible for what happened in your past relationship and anger is not the best emotion to help you heal. You can move forward from here, with forgiveness for yourself. Forgiveness is a slow process, so don't worry if it takes you a long time. Start with forgiving yourself for not recognizing what was happening to you sooner and then start forgiving yourself for not leaving the relationship sooner. The more self forgiving you are the more you will feel ready to walk forward with a new, healthier, relationship in your future. Hope this is helpful!",0.4456022381782532
"I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with. It was brief and turned into us being just good friends.
   I spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend. Was i wrong?","Depends on your definition of ""wrong"" on this one. Was it objectively wrong to spend the weekend with a good friend, who also happens to be an ex? Probably not. But, it upset your current boyfriend, and he is entitled to his feelings if you are in a relationship with him. He may be out of line if he assumes that anything happened between you and your ex that would compromise the relationship, however your boyfriend being upset might also mean that he wanted to spend that kind of weekend with you and did not get to do that.Long story short, it might help your relationship to understand more, and be curious, not judge-y, around what is upsetting for him. Perhaps having empathy for his experience of the behavior could help him to feel more secure with you having relationships with your ex(es).","It is never wrong to be friends with anyone. It is normal.   Having past relationships with someone does not mean you cannot be friends with them. If you were only dating this guy for a short while, you are not connected enough to form the type of relationship that would cause jealousy for your boyfriend.  If you notice this jealousy, then you need to have a conversation about what is bothering him.  Perhaps he doesn't understand why you feel it would be okay to be friends with someone from the past.",0.4523022770881653
I'm very depressed. How do I find someone to talk to?,"If there is no one in your life with whom you feel comfortable, I would recommend identifying someone on this site, psychology today or goodtherapy.org who is in your area, then give that therapist a call to see if you would be a good match.","If you're struggling with depression, you may find your life feels very difficult to manage.  It helps a lot to have someone to talk with that you can trust and feel secure with.  I don't mean just anyone in the family,  there are also many people we don't trust in our lives, for example, people we meet on Craigslist.  There may even be people who you think you trust, who may not be that open with you, and thus not helpful.  However, there are also people in your community you may not know well enough, who would be willing to listen, if you approached them with an open heart.  I have found that when depression hits, the people in the room we are the most familiar with are the ones whom we talk to the least.  I'd say a good first step would be to notice the people in your life that you might enjoy talking to that you are not talking to often. Maybe try inviting one of them for coffee and asking if they'd be willing to just listen, for the first meeting.  It's one of the easiest things to ask people.  Also, many local churches have a person or group on staff who can provide support.  It's always a good idea to have 2-3 people that you feel comfortable talking with for support.  If you can't find someone, consider a crisis hotline, they can sometimes provide what is called ""active listening"", which includes validating your emotions and helping you to feel less alone.  This may be easier to do with someone whose background you don't know, because they aren't part of your life in the same way.  You may find they can give you a different perspective.  Sometimes there are people who you do know well, who are helpful and who feel like a good support for you.  You may just need to help them understand how you are feeling so they know what to say.  The hardest part is breaking through that wall, but once it is open, the relationship is very helpful.",0.4851316213607788
"I was raped a couple months ago, Since then, along with other unfortunately events that have occurred, I have been having trouble feeling emotions. It's almost as if I'm a sociopath lacking any feeling. What can I do to change this?","You are describing a very legitimate reaction to trauma.  Rape is an aweful experience and I am very sorry that happened to you.  When horrible things happen, people often react in a way that interferes with the ability to live a normal life and function the way they did in the past.  This is very common and the goal is to help you manage the stress caused by dealing with negative events and with help you can regain emotional well-being.  This is especially important if you have had more than one negative thing happen.  Oftentimes, the unconscious reaction is to become numb and avoid all feelings, especially if more than one negative event occurred.  A big part of what causes people trouble are feelings of guilt.  We often blame ourselves when bad things happen. It is actually difficult to comprehend the concept that we don't always have control of what happens in life.  In addition, when you mentioned feeling like a sociopath, it sounded like you feel like your reaction is wrong.  The first thing you can do is realize that your feelings and reactions are o.k., you aren't doing anything wrong, and nothing is wrong with you.  The next step is to start dealing with the impact of these traumatic experiences. Identifying your feelings, and knowing the thoughts and beliefs that are behind those emotions can help you regain your sense of happiness.  Research shows that understanding and expressing those thoughts and feelings can help.  If doesn't sound like you need to do anything to change yourself, but talking to a counselor can be helpful in managing your reaction to a incredibly traumatic experience.  I hope this helps you understand your feelings and can get to a place where you enjoy life.","There are many options to consider for your issue. In the short term, counseling with a therapist would be the best option for you to start getting to the root of the problem. Counseling will also help you cope with what you are experiencing and come up with strategies for getting through it without having to act like a sociopath. For many people, emotional numbing such as you describe is a typical response to trauma such as a rape. This may be something called dissociation. I would recommend that you speak with a therapist right away, because the longer that you wait, the harder it will be to process and work through what happened. It is also something that does get better with time and therapy. The longer you wait, the more and more the impact of the trauma will linger in your life. I wish you the best of luck.

However, it is possible to start working on this question from day one! What I suggest is to ask yourself the following:1) Are you comfortable talking with your therapist?2) Do you feel safe sharing your concerns and your background with your therapist?3) Do you feel like your therapist listens to you, asks questions to clarify things, and seeks to really understand your life?4) Are you at least getting something out of each session? Do you feel like the discussion is leading to any new insights?5) Do you feel that this therapist is helping you grow in some way, no matter how small?It is good practice to reflect on each of these things after a few sessions. If the answer to any of these is no, you can ask your therapist if it might be helpful for you to explore something else (for example, referral to a more suited therapist, or perhaps another type of therapy - like a group therapy).",0.4683074355125427

When that time matches with a time that is good for you, try discussing the type of relationship that you each want to have and what you can start and stop doing to get there. He may want to be really good friends. He may also be trying to figure out what he is feeling. If you end up talking over one another, try letting one person be the one who is talking about their feelings for about five minutes and during that time, try having the other person asked questions to gain more understanding of their experience.

Also consider asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no, but lead to more explanations.Questions that start with the words how, what, when, who are usually better than questions starting with ""why"" because they can be emotional triggers for some people.If this is difficult to do between the two of you, consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couples.","You love him very much, but you may be coming to the conclusion you cannot be in a relationship with him.This may be a conclusion you were hoping to avoid, but I wonder if it's a step to take in order to move forward with your life with less suffering.Your boyfriend has the option to change his behavior, which means that the relationship will be able to remain intact and grow stronger.If he chooses to not change and stay how he is, then it will be up to you whether or not you are willing to tolerate this as you have for so long. If you try to control the situation and expect him to change as an ultimatum, then you are not in a relationship that is meant to be.You may feel very conflicted in being asked to consider ending a relationship that you love, but you may also feel that not only is this a natural choice, but you need to be allowed the freedom to make the choice that feels the best for you.",0.42901504039764404
"I'm applying to private high schools. I'm playing basketball on my school team currently, and I love it. I also play on a team that I've hated since the beginning, and I finally want to quit before the season gets started. However, my parents say I can play on either both teams or neither. I think it's unfair because it's up to me if I want to play for a certain team. I was planning on playing basketball for the high school I get into, but if that means continuing to play for the team I hate, then I wouldn't want to play in high school. Now I don't know what to do! My parents are threatening to send me off to a different home if I don't play. I just want to run away.","The situation in your family seems to place unnecessary pressure on you.Are you and your parents able to talk together about their reason for their standard?Are your parents willing to listen to your reasons to not play on the team you hate?If yes, then maybe some type of compromise is possible for all of you to negotiate.If none of the above is possible, then you may want to get specific and direct advice from a professional, such as the school guidance counselor or psychologist, whom you'd trust and feel safe in talking.I hope you and your parents will find an answer that all of you are happy to accept.","Hi St.Louis, I am sorry that you are going through such a difficult time right now.  It sounds like your parents have a lot of expectations for you and aren't very willing to accept you decisions.  You have every right to decide what goes into your life and how you spend your time.  Your parents have rights too, but they don't have the power to take away your freedom of decision.  Have you told your parents how you feel?  Try to explain your situation to them and see if you can reach a compromise.   You can't force your parents to give you what you want, but you have a better chance of reaching your goals if you try to have a conversation with your parents first.  Is there any chance that they would let you play with your current team and leave their team?  This is up to them to decide, but you have the right to try to explain your reasoning to them.  You don't have to go to this extreme to work things out, but it is an option.  It is your decision on what to do with your time.",0.4912738800048828
"Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes  I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I can't get it out.  How can I stop these thoughts?","Hi there,I first want to let you know that having these thoughts is completely normal. Studies have been done that show that 80% of human thoughts are ""negative"" so you are not alone. I like to think of thoughts as a tornado... if you are in a tornado, you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial. However, when you are, let's say, a mile away from a tornado, it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as get shelter or make sure your family and friends are safe. When unhelpful or scary thoughts arise, we tend to start a ""war"" with them, which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado. This makes the thoughts and emotions bigger and intensifies the feelings that go with them. So the question I imagine you have is ""how do I get out of the tornado?"" There are 3 steps to doing this:Get distance from your thoughts by adding ""I am noticing I'm having the thought that...."" to the front of them. For example, ""I am noticing I am having the thought that something bad is going to happen to me.""   The purpose of this is not to decrease your fear or get rid of the thought. These thoughts might always be there and that is okay because that is how the mind naturally works so struggling with that is a waste of time and energy. The purpose is to gain some distance from the thoughts so you don't get swept away by them. You can imagine them floating along like leaves in a stream or clouds in the sky (and often the same thought will come back again and again but that's okay... just continue to notice it with curiosity). I imagine the thoughts get in your way of doing what really matters to you so if you can get a little bit of distance, you can do things that are fulfilling and meaningful to you. Tune into your body and notice what sensations come up and where you feel them most intensely. Then breathe into them and make room for them. Our 5 main emotions are: joy, sadness, fear/anxiety, shame, and anger. ALL of these emotions are part of being human and there is no escaping them. So again, struggling with them ends up intensifying them. Instead, let them be and make a little bit of room for them. Often a side effect of this is the intensity will decrease but it might not. The purpose is to keep them from becoming more intense. Contact the present moment. Notice what is happening here and now. One way of doing this is tuning into the five senses. What are some things you hear, see, taste, smell, and feel? Another way is to notice what is happening in your body (without trying to change it). How deep are your breaths, what is happening with your heart rate, are you cold/warm, etc?Implementing these three steps can help you to refrain from getting caught up in your unhelpful thoughts. Unfortunately there is no way to get rid of thoughts or feelings completely. So the only option that works in the long run is to accept them while continuing to do what matters to you and what is fulfilling to you.I hope this helps!","Thoughts can be tricky. Some days they can be out of the blue, just there, and some days they can be triggered. Both kinds of thoughts can really take you off of your game and make you miserable. What is causing them? What are they, and when do you first notice them? It sounds like you are in this loop that you can't get out, which can be really tough to manage. Some types of thoughts can be managed a bit more easily than others. Are you willing to do some work so you can feel better? If you are, it is a great first step and something that will take some time and patience. As scary as your thoughts can be, your mind can also be your best friend! You can train it to be. Your thoughts can be managed with the help of a therapist and medications. If you get scared enough of a thought, it can break you, and I don't want that for you. There are other avenues of treatment, though. Are you suicidal right now? If you are, call someone immediately at 800-273-8255. If not, then you can also talk to your doctor about this. If your doctor doesn't provide you the support you need, please seek out a therapist. There is no magic pill or method, but I can give you a list of the various things you can do to start the process of training your mind to be in the present. Take your time and take care of yourself, there is light on the other side! :)",0.42662423849105835
"I started dating my fiancé two years ago. My first cousin is married to my fiancé’s sister. There has always been a communication issue between my uncle and aunt and my cousin and his wife. My uncle goes to my mom instead of talking to my cousin, and it upsets my mom.","Based on the information provided, this is an issue with boundaries.   Sounds like your uncle goes to your mom and possibly your mother takes the issues to you.  I do not like to assume so I will direct you to information regarding families dealing with enmeshment and triangulation.  Enmeshment is the concept of diffused boundaries in families and other personal relationships.  Triangulation is two individuals relaying information to a third party what cannot be said directly to each other.  From someone who has dealt with both these issues on a personal level, being informed about family dynamics is beneficial and can help you develop healthy boundaries for yourself within your family structure.  You may need assistance with developing healthy boundaries.  Although it is possible, it is not easy to change the way you have been operating for any extended amount of time.  Hope this help!","We can never fully control how our family members behave. So often times we are left with making choices that satisfy one person in the family, which then leaves someone else feeling left out, angry, or devalued.  In this case, you could say that your mom is over-prioritizing your uncle's feelings over your cousin and wife.  I would suggest you first seek support within your immediate family unit.  You don't want to alienate your mom by telling her that you disagree with what she is doing.  Perhaps, you can encourage her to see the way her actions are impacting your cousin and wife.  If you are not comfortable in expressing your opinion or if she continues to deny this, you could have some conversations with another person she is close to, so that someone else can mediate the discussion.  If this is not an option for you, then it is most likely that nothing will change.  It is sometimes that if something won't change, the best thing to do is simply not allow yourself to be affected by other people's choices.  In the long run, it is better to focus on your own well being than to worry about other people's behaviors, especially their behaviors that affect you so much.",0.4794338345527649
"In 2008 my former husband of 14 years walked away from my life and we've been separated ever since. We have always been together sexually and both have experienced sleeping with others. I stopped because I wanted my marriage to work out but he did not. If he stops sleeping with other women, can our marriage be saved? Or should we just part ways? I still care deeply about him after all that I did and he has done. But he is seeing someone else on and off for years now. Will our marriage still be saved if he decides that he wants to try to do so?","Sorry to hear about the stress in your relationship.  There is definite value in being clear as you are, about your own emotional investment in your husband and that you expect sexual exclusivity from him as part of the foundation of your marriage.Also positive is your awareness that only your husband is the one who must similarly decide his own standards of being sexually exclusive to you, or not.Whether your marriage can be saved depends on what each person is willing to accept about the other one.Is sleeping with other women the only criterion of what will satisfy you about being together with your husband?Love and care are not enough to make a marriage work. Partners need to be able to compromise and cooperate with each other. That you care for him definitely intensifies any emotion you feel toward your husband.  It intensifies any frustration and sadness about the relationship too.Decide how much emotional sadness and hurt you're willing to tolerate and the reason you're willing to do so.From what you write, you are being very generous of yourself and not being reciprocated for this.If your husband doesn't start taking steps toward satisfying your wishes, this may be your time to question your own generosity in waiting for him to do so.","There isn't one correct answer.I imagine you're thinking you love your ex-husband very much, you still care about him very much and it's hard to let go.On one hand, it seems as though he's trying to do what he can to help things.It is possible for both of you to make this work but on the other hand the damage is done and he's not trying as hard as you think he is, he's shown that by seeing someone else.The only way to know for sure is to try and if you decide to open your heart up again, give it the time it needs.If he stops sleeping with others and shows the same interest in you as you had for him, it is possible it could work again.

I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.","Are you able to give yourself some peace of mind while you take the time to further address whether or not you are gay?Whether or not and to what degree a person accepts their sexuality, depends on dense factors such as the culture of your family, the beliefs about gay people with which you were brought up, and your own tolerance for being a unique individual.Examining these factors, whether inwardly by yourself, in online blogs and sites, or live with other people, requires patience and effort.The more you are willing to commit to figuring out your own truth, the greater is your chance of finding it!","Hi, New Orleans!It is completely normal for feelings to change. For example, you might find yourself excited about going to a baseball game one year, then bored about it a few years later. Your interest in men is likely a new stage in your exploration of your sexuality. It may be a feeling you are experiencing because of a change in your life. You can experiment with new situations, or you can try to understand yourself better by asking yourself questions such as, ""What do I like and dislike about men?"" ""Why would I prefer women?"" or ""What do I believe about how people of the opposite sex should behave?"" Sometimes it can be helpful to think about when your interest in men came up, and what was going on in your life at that time. Consider the ways in which you are currently feeling. Do you feel more in tune with your inner self? Are you comfortable with who you are? In order to better understand your feelings of sexual interest, try to examine where they are coming from. You can also spend time with a counselor and explore all of your feelings. There are several non-profit organizations, like one called the Center for Sexuality, that offer confidential and affordable counseling in our community. The bottom line is, feeling comfortable with yourself and understanding where your interests are coming from can help to ease your anxiety about who you are and how you'll feel about yourself in the future. I wish you well as you continue to explore your sexuality!",0.39242255687713623
I blame my past relationship for it. I know it is bad to be this way. I want to get past it.,"We humans are social beings. We learn how to BE in relationship as children. The caregiving you received (or didn't receive) set the stage for how you show up in all your adult relationships. Insecurity in relationships often has much to do with feeling unheard or unseen, perhaps feeling like you don't matter. There are many ways to rewire these relational patterns, the first step of which is taking pause and noticing that you are feeling insecure - so congrats on that because clearly you are already there!  Next I'd suggest finding a relationship therapist to help you sort through your insecurities, either as a couple or individually. ","Sorry to hear you're struggling with feeling like you're not good enough. The truth is, we all have insecure moments here and there. I want to encourage you to practice self-compassion.

"I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.
 I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. While your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard. Talk to them during a non-emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as ""you NEVER listen,"" ""you ALWAYS say..."" and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with ""you"" try using ""I"" by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist, teacher, or school counselor if possible. Most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help.Best of luck to you.","Hi West Virginia, I'm sorry to hear that your relationship with your parents is strained. It's tough to grow up with parents who don't take you seriously. Are your parents in a position to be open to discussion? Can you tell them something like, ""I'm feeling frustrated because I don't feel listened to. It hurts my feelings when you don't believe me."" Your parents may not ever see things your way, but there are things you can do to feel better. One is to practice some self-compassion. It sounds like you feel isolated and alone, and these are tough feelings to carry around. When you are feeling these feelings, try and remind yourself that these are normal feelings and that you don't have to carry them. Think about how a compassionate friend would treat you if you were going through the same thing, and then treat yourself that way. Another option is to seek out others who do take you seriously. It sounds like your friends don't have the space to be there for you right now. I hope this changes in the future. If that is not the case, consider seeking out people like you who may find it easier to relate to each other. There may be gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and other related organizations in your area that may be open to meeting like minded friends. And lastly, try and practice good self-care. Things like proper sleep, healthy eating, and regular exercise can improve your mood and make coping with difficult situations easier. It may also be worth considering that you may be feeling like your parents do not accept you the way you are, which is a tough feeling to have. The way a family member talks and treats someone matters, regardless of whether or not they understand. It's ok to seek support and community outside of your family, or find your own sense of community that you feel valued by. I wish you the very best.",0.2314094752073288

How do I help him?",How do you help yourself to believe you require more than what he offers to you?What do you get from this relationship which feels satisfying?To answer this question may in the longterm be the best way to help your bf.,"First off, have you tried talking to your step-dad about how you are feeling or about his behavior? He may feel as if his own stresses and burdens are getting in the way of him being there for his son, and there may be some root causes for it that you are not aware of. If you do decide to have a conversation, try to frame it in the way that it is your observation and concern, rather than an accusation. I understand it can be tough, but your step-dad will likely be more receptive to this if he feels as if you are speaking with genuine care rather than trying to tell him what to do with his actions. If he feels as if he is in no position to have an open dialogue, it may be that you focus on doing your best to be supportive of your step-son and encouraging him to get better. Sometimes people respond better to support and encouragement than they do to being told what to do. Try to show him some common areas of interest that you have with him, and try to find ways to spend time with him doing things you both enjoy.

My fiancé and I broke up. He cheated on me numerous times. I kept forgiving but questioning his every move. He got tired and left.,if he as cheated on you multiple times it is not healthy for you to continue seeing him.  However It takes time to heal your pain. You are not a robot that can just switch off your emotions.  Please surround yourself with people who can support and empower you. ,You and your fiance had an unhealthy dynamic where you felt insecure and insecure partners tend to worry more about being cheated on than the one doing cheating.  You felt like you were walking on eggshells of insecurity.As you realized that your fiance wasn't the one making you feel secure then you stopped him by being done and walking away.   He got tired of you begging to stay and you had to learn that being secure in yourself is more important than staying with a person who can't give what you need. The first step to creating a fulfilling relationship is in building a healthy relationship with yourself first. You may need to see a therapist or find a counselor and have some work done within yourself.     This would help you stop being insecure and have a clear understanding of what kind of person you want in a relationship.,0.45856398344039917
"I have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.","Something to remember about anxiety is that it's a useful and necessary response to stressors, and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming. Anxiety is our brain's way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action. Some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. The first I'd recommend is a calm breathing technique - breathe in for 4-5 seconds, and then out for 7-8 seconds. Try to repeat this for 3-5 minutes. Another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe - without judging - the sensations to yourself. Try to be very specific, such as ""my palms are feeling very sweaty, and I can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies."" Then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad - just experiencing them as intentionally as possible.  Combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful. If you feel that these techniques don't help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to, then I'd highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional. This professional can help you determine if therapy/counseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms.","Anxiety is an emotion, but living with anxiety sounds like a lot of work to you. How does this anxiety make you feel (tired, hopeless, fearful, insecure)? How does anxiety serve you in some way or way to feel safe?  What would it be like if you felt secure with your own self and the life you are living? Where do you think the anxiety is coming from? Do you have a family history with anxiety or panic attacks? What would a therapist feel like to you?

"I am a really shy person. I'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?","I can offer you hypnosis for confidence in presentations, via Skype, if you're in Cali.","The first thing you need to know is that being shy is okay. It's a normal and natural way for many people to be in certain situations. When you talk about presentations, I wonder what specifically makes you feel ""less confident""? Sometimes people are shy because they have heard things from their parents about being shy. It is possible that you developed some fear of public speaking as a child. In that case, if you're uncomfortable speaking in public, it's because you have learned to associate that situation with feeling insecure and awkward, and not necessarily that you are not a good speaker. It sounds like maybe you are a naturally outgoing person and being in a graduate program takes you out of your comfort zone and makes you feel less confident than you know you can be. It doesn't sound like you've been doing this long. Since this is new to you, this is the time for you to do some risk-taking and try new things. If you don't work on being comfortable in public now, and you don't have any more opportunities to feel comfortable in public, then this issue will always be a challenge and a worry. Here are some things to try right away:  1) Make a speech for your friends. That is not a public speaking situation. 2) If you have any courses or areas of your graduate program that don't require presentations, try to make use of those for practice. 3) When you're in your presentations, don't make eye contact with people. Focus on looking at the floor! And when someone asks you to do something, ask them to repeat the request. That way you don't have to worry about what they're saying to you. 4) Dress more comfortably than required. If you are comfortable in what you're wearing, you might be less preoccupied with your self.  5) If you're in your presentations, don't smile. It's a sign of insecurity.If you don't have any courses that require presentations, then ask your professor about it. It sounds like your program is one that requires a lot of presentations, and your professor may have some ideas. It may also be helpful to ask your friends to be in the audience, so that you can have a friend in the audience that can be supportive in the back. If this is possible, there may be a way for you to look at your friends while you're giving your presentation and see their friendly faces. Good luck!",0.42577987909317017
What makes a healthy marriage last?,"Thank you for your question.  A good Marriage is one that takes hard work and commitment.  Being in a good marriage does not always mean good times because let's face it; we are dealing with 2 unique individuals with differences.  A good spouse or partner knows to be patient and accepting.  Knowing each other's strengths and imperfections and working with them to lift each other is how you strengthen your love for one another.  A good spouse sacrifices their needs to see the other person happy.  Don't get me wrong, that also means that it is important to have alone time to re-charge and re-focus our purpose in the marriage.  In all, there is not a magic recipe for a successful marriage, but with time, work and purpose one can have a happy one.","There are no ""right ways"" to be a married person. However, studies of long term happy couples have identified five areas of good functioning which increase the odds of a lasting relationship. For example: a common life view, shared personal values, trust, mutual emotional support, and conflict resolution skills. There are many couples counselors who offer their help and guide people through developing these areas through open communication.",0.44429969787597656

The ""accusations"" you mention are a natural response to someone who feels threatened and who is at the end of his rope about your interactions.  We both have expectations of what a healthy relationship looks like.

"Sometime when small thing happen, like losing a comb, I get furious.  I even start throwing things. Do I have a problem?","I don't like the word ""problem"".  It is such a strong word.  However I would say that you have an issue that needs to be addressed and controlled before it directed at the wrong person and gets totally out of control.  I have found that anger management classes has been helpful for my clients.  Try and see if it will help.  You will be surprised at what you learn about your self.",You are definitely not the only one who gets so upset over little things.  Often this kind of behavior can be a way of managing bigger emotions you are having in the back of your mind.  I'd be wondering if something similar happens with big things.  Also I'd be wondering if you have a good relationship with your parents.  And what is your level of education?  The more education you have the more you will know about this and there is no reason to have a problem if you are rational and not afraid of losing your home.,0.4002283811569214
I recently lost a friend to suicide. I'm smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it. How can I handle this better?,"Suicide is a very traumatic loss and affects survivors significantly. Everyone deals with their grief in different ways. One way I recommend to deal with the loss of a loved one is to write letters to them. Some people like to keep the letters in a jar, maybe fill the jar with sand so the letters are buried. I recommend writing the letters as often as you need to. You will notice over time the need to write the letters will decrease and the intense feelings of loss will decrease. I also recommend finding a survivors support group in your area. You can find more information on www.afsp.org.",Suicide of a friend is very difficult because you feel like you could have done something different.  It's natural to turn to substances to cope with the grief that comes with suicide.  It's a good thing that you are aware of this and you may want to explore other healthy coping strategies such as exercising or spending time with friends and family.  Alcohol and marijuana are depressants and may be hindering your ability to cope with the grief.  You may find a support group for survivors of suicide in your area through the suicide prevention hotline (800.273.8255).  This hotline offers a list of resources for grief counseling as well.,0.4436706304550171
"Maybe this is a stupid question, but I sometimes don't know what's real or not. If feel at times like everyone's lying. How do I know if God is one of those lies?","  It is not a stupid question, it is very basic. To help answer your question, let me begin with the premise that you will never have absolute proof. With that being said, one can look at different phenomena in nature and history and figure what is the statistical probability that they happened randomly. If one comes to the logical conclusion that many are quite improbable, then there must be a guiding force and plan.  May you be successful in your journey.","This is really an important and difficult question. There are many different views about the existence of God. Some people believe that God exists, some people don't believe in God, and some people don't know if God exists or not. There is no objective way of proving whether God exists. What matters more to me is that you are feeling the effects of what you're describing as a spiritual call.   It sounds like you may be in the middle of discovering who you are. If you want to find out what your path is, I would highly recommend you begin by talking to a therapist. When people are in touch with their spirituality, it often shakes the foundations of who they are and who they thought they wanted to be. It will require time, self-reflection, and practice to sort this out, but with a therapist by your side to guide you, you could find the answers you are looking for!",0.47386032342910767
"I feel that I need to end my present relationship. He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.","It sounds like you have some insight into the cycle that you describe with your current relationship and at the same time you are still feeling stuck. It also sounds like the distressing feelings that you experience, when you imagine what will happen for you and your current partner, are pretty overwhelming. A competent therapist may be able to help you work through these difficult thoughts and feelings and find a resolution to this cycle that will feel right to you.","I hear you: your feeling of your partner being more distant in this relationship sounds a lot like the fear of your own rejection.  And sometimes, when you're feeling vulnerable and scared in a relationship, one of the first things we tend to do is to seek reassurance.  You say it's ""not healthy to stay in this cycle"" but there's another part of you that wants to reconcile because it's familiar and it protects you from something very uncomfortable: your fear of being alone and unloved.If it feels right to you, I would offer that you would also consider checking in with yourself to see what you learn about what's happening in the cycle you just experienced.  Perhaps it is that you do fear being alone and it's also true that he doesn't want to be apart from you.  Sometimes our anxiety is a mirror to what we fear.",0.48651009798049927
How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,"That's a loaded question.  Typically, if we are contemplating if we should or not, it is for a reason.  To really come to a place of decision, you need to know where you are right now, what is not working, what the potential resolution would be and if it is realistic.  If you can answer those questions, you may gain some insight.   If it is realistic and your boyfriend is on the same page, seek help putting a plan in motion for resolution.  And I mention him being on the same page because if he is not, then it will never come to fruiting.  Without much other information, this is this is a solid approach.","The good news is you already have all the information you need. What do you think about your relationship? How does it make you feel? How often do you argue? Where do you feel you grow in the relationship? What is your boyfriend looking for? Is your boyfriend the right person for you? If you can answer those, you'll have a good idea about whether the relationship is healthy for you. If not, consider talking with a local therapist or counselor.Good luck.",0.46135789155960083
I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.,"The older I get, the more I believe that our real task isn't to 'find' ourselves. We're already 100% ""there."" What we do have to do is become more mindful of the times when we feel the most alive, most happy, most creative, and most fully engaged with life. It is in those moments that we find ourselves.For example, I couldn't help loving the people or things I loved, no matter who tried to talk me out of them. All I needed to do was notice when my heart opened and I felt the most alive--not because I was afraid or addicted, but because in those moments, I was in contact with my highest self. On the flip side, I needed to recognize the people and activities that consistently brought out the worst in me--the ones that made me feel controlled, constricted, dishonest, resentful, or afraid--and be honest about them. Mindfulness of ""what already is"" is the key to finding yourself. Align yourself with the people and activities that matter most to you. Don't let old habits, crappy jobs, or mean-spirited people define you. Just stumble your way forward as best you can, with greater self-awareness followed by affirmative action..   ",Have you had a counselor work with you on getting to know who you are and what you would like from life?,0.44386744499206543
"Whenever I run into a situation that makes me upset or angry, I tend to start cursing and badly offending the person I am confronting. I say mean things to let my anger out. Whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship (like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship) I lash out not just them but at my boyfriend. I feel like I keep causing drama due to my personality. I want to be a better person and learn to let things not get to me and be happy and graceful. I hurt the ones I love with my words. I want to be better for myself and them.","Congratulations on making your way to Step One, self-observation and deciding to change a feature about how you understand and relate to others.There is extraordinary strength in being willing to notice your effect on others and consider what changes are possible.Start on the inside track of your own heart and mind.  Once you're able to understand what is driving your emotions to the point where the only reasonable way of handling them is to curse and offend people, you'd have gotten a long way in knowing your own expectations of others and how far off the mark from this in your mind, they are.For example, if you expect others to always be accepting, tolerant and happy about situations with your boyfriend, and you're hearing otherwise from people, then you can prepare yourself for possible, less than positive comments about your relationship, or you can ask people to not comment to you about your relationship at all.Basically, the more you know about yourself and are willing to accept your right to ask others to respect your views, the easier and calmer time you'll have in handling comments from others that you're not glad hearing.Also, this is a long process because you'd be trying to change long time and deep patterns of interacting.Be patient with your own learning curve and certainly consider therapy for yourself in order to have some outside guidance and support for the process you're placing yourself.","Hi! I'm sorry to hear that you've been having difficulty with your anger and self-care. A lot of times when people struggle with anger they're actually doing it to cover up feelings of sadness, hurt, disappointment, fear or grief. Understanding what you are feeling can help you to address the issue and not just your anger. Once you're more aware of what you're feeling, you can begin to address the core issue by taking the following steps:1) Try to sit and observe what you are feeling without any kind of judgement. Are you sad? Angry? Hurt? Scared? Feeling depressed? Trying to avoid uncomfortable emotions?2) Look at how long you have been struggling with anger. Is it a sudden thing that you're dealing with right now or is this something that has gone on for a long time?3) Once you've determined what you're feeling and learned to sit and observe it, then you can focus on why you feel the way you do. What situation are you experiencing that triggers you? What do you like and not like in that relationship? What is the reason that you're being treated in a certain way by this person?4) Develop some strategies for what you're going to do once you feel overwhelmed or triggered. For example, If you feel hurt, maybe you will walk away from the situation and talk about it with someone you trust. If you feel angry, maybe you will go to a busy place and walk around for a bit or count backwards from 100 to calm yourself down.5) Try to incorporate a practice or a routine that is calming and soothing to you. It can be anything from deep breathing to listening to music. One of my clients used to sit in her car after a driving rage session and play her favorite songs for 10 minutes.  Another one went for a nap in his car every afternoon. Whatever helps you to feel calm is worth doing.There are also many exercises that I would recommend you try out, such as ""the balloon exercise"" or the ""body scan"". The details can be found on many different websites, as well as in a book called ""The Anger Workbook"" by Dr. William B. White. The most important thing is to take baby steps and realize that it is OKAY to make mistakes. The more that you understand what you're feeling and start to notice the triggers, the less likely you are to get upset and lash out at people who care about you! I wish you the best of luck with it! Be sure to practice self-care and be patient with yourself along the way! :)",0.47875696420669556
