"We weren't long distance until he joined the military.  I love him and I know he loves, me but it's complicated. He said he's not going to find someone else, but I'm afraid. How do I keep our relationship going?","You're wise to be aware of possible changes to your relationship once your bf is away from you for extended time periods.All you both can do is state your intentions and wishes, keep in contact as much as possible, and wait to see how your relationship unfolds.To a large degree, each of you is relying on faith that if the relationship is meant to last for a while, then it will.   The military may add stress.This doesn't necessarily mean the stress will dissolve the relationship.Sometimes all anyone is able to do, is try.","Hi! I am so sorry that you are having to go through this. I am sure that it is difficult.

"I have no real friends. I have a girlfriend who irritates me but loves me to death. I push her away and pushes me away. We’re going through a breakup, and I have nobody.","Having time all to yourself may be necessary so you have time to reflect on your own identity and values, become more clear on what matters most to you, and with this increased self-understanding, be able to attract people who will feel like satisfying friends.Having a relationship with someone whom you push away and are pushed away, with someone who is irritating, seems to have limited benefit for each of you.Maybe you are together from fear of being alone, and being alone is exactly what you may now need in your life in order to draw more favorable people to you.","The way you're talking about your relationship with your girlfriend sounds like it's a little confusing for you. It sounds like you want to be with her but you're not happy in the relationship. It also sounds like you're pushing her away and that you don't want to be with her. If you're not happy in a relationship, it's okay to end it. It's okay to be with someone who makes you happy. I'm not saying that you should end the relationship, but if you're not happy in it, you need to be honest with yourself and your girlfriend about how you feel. It's also okay to not have a lot of friends. Not everyone needs a lot of friends. But if you feel lonely, you could try to find some new friends. Maybe you could join a group that has similar interests as you. If you're feeling sad, I would recommend talking to someone about it. It could be your girlfriend or a friend, but if you don't have anyone you feel comfortable talking to, you could talk to a therapist.",0.5386964678764343,9.761210706679681e-79,0.15384615384615383,0.22467977593428703
I feel like my time is going too fast,"Thank you for reaching out! That is a great question! As an American, I can truly say that I spend way too much time on the go! It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe! I often ask myself, what if I only had one day left on this Earth? What would I do? Well, that is an easy question. I would spend it with my family! Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World, right? Its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring.Time management is a very important factor when learning to ""live life to the fullest""! In fact, this is a required course in undergraduate college now. Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this. Personally, for myself I like to keep a calendar with a to-do list. I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list. That way, if I do not get through the list, I am not stressing over the little things. When planning your day, it is important you schedule work, eat and play. A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. There is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this, then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse/partner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there. Again, everyone has their own style on time management. I hope this was helpful for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out for anything further!","I would like to first say that I am sorry for what you are going through.  I would like to also add that you are not alone in this feeling.  Many people go through this feeling of time moving too fast.  I will offer you some suggestions to try and slow down time.  I will also add that I am not sure if you have kids or not, if you do this may be a reason for the feeling you are going through.  If you do not have kids, then I would like to ask you to think about your childhood and if you felt the same way as you do now.  I would also like to add that if you do have kids, I would like to ask you if you had the same feeling when you were younger.  I am going to ask you to think about these things, because I believe that it will help you to understand what is going on.  I will also add that this feeling is normal and it is okay to feel this way.  I would like to offer you a few things to try and slow down the feeling of time moving too fast.  The first thing I would like to offer you is to try and slow down your day to day activities.  This may mean to try and take a walk during your lunch break at work, or it may mean to turn off the TV and spend some time with your family.  The second thing I would like to offer you is to try and live in the present.  I would like to offer you a book that I have read and I have found to be very helpful.  The book is called “The Power of Now” by Eckhart Tolle.  I would also like to offer you a quote by the great author, Ralph Waldo Emerson.  The quote is “When it is dark enough, you can see the stars.”  I hope that these things help you to slow down the feeling of time moving too fast.  If you need any further help please feel free to reach out to me.  I wish you the best of luck.",0.5459992289543152,1.8463026878789987e-78,0.17732558139534885,0.2706235220094236
"He wants to wear makeup and heels. He even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina. He wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him. I have tried this for him, but I don’t like it and have told him so. He keeps making comments about it and says he can't live without it.","It sounds like you may be asking two different questions.With regard to what you said about your husband dressing as a female in your bedroom, I wonder if you would consider asking him more about this. If you choose to do that, I would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience. This can be difficult to do at times, particularly when you may want to offer your own opinions or become very anxious or of type. Consider thinking of a phrase that may help you to stay calm during the discussion. It may be helpful to think of yourself as asking questions as if you were an investigative reporter and using questions that start with words like ""what, how, who, where, when."" Questions that start with ""why,"" can be very difficult to answer for some people and can be overwhelming because it often links to answers involving emotions that may or may not be understood. Also try restating what your husband is saying to make sure that you are understanding correctly. If what he is telling you is different than what you have heard or thought of for many years, it may be challenging to follow his meaning initially. Remember that listening to your husband does not imply agreement with what he is saying, just that you are following and looking to understand what he is experiencing. I also recommend sticking to one topic for the conversation, but this could be done with many different topics over time.You could also see if he would be willing to have a discussion where he listens like an investigative reporter to learn more about the experience that you are having.As far as what you mentioned about the sexual experience, maybe if you can discuss what it is that you don't like and/or understand what it is that he does like, you could see if there is some middle ground here. It depends on what you both prefer.These types of conversations can be difficult to have for some couples, at least initially. Having structured conversations, such as the ones I've described briefly above, can feel awkward initially, but the reason it can be helpful is because it can lead to further understanding in a way that decreases the chances of having an argument.Also consider seeing a therapist in your area who specializes in couples to discuss some of these ideas.","I don't know how old you are, but it's possible that you're still in the process of figuring out your sexual preferences.  I think it's great that you're willing to try new things with your partner.  I don't know whether you're comfortable with him being a female or not, but I do think it's important that you are comfortable with your own sexual preferences.  If you're not comfortable with the idea of anal sex or cross-dressing, then it's okay to say so.  If you're not sure whether you are or not, you may want to explore that with a therapist.  If you're both open to it, you may want to explore this with a therapist together.  You may also want to see if you can find a support group for people who are in similar situations as you.",0.5680679082870483,0.007683000539579117,0.15780445969125212,0.11896662791063065
"I am a really shy person. I'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?","First of all, way to go in stretching yourself out of your comfort zone! You are sure to grow through all of this practice presenting to your peers, and that in itself will help to grow your confidence over time. In the meantime, do whatever you can to help yourself feel prepared for each presentation. Do your work ahead of time so that you feel well-informed on your topic, and then spend the days leading up to your presentation practicing. Do your presentation in the mirror, while you are driving (if it won't distract you from the road), and practice in front of a friend. On the day of the presentation, eat a balanced meal, get a pep talk from a supportive friend, use deep breathing to keep your body calm, and remind yourself that you are prepared. You got this!","I'm sorry to hear about your anxiety.  Public speaking is a common fear.  One way to help build your confidence is to practice in a safe environment.  You could join an organization like Toastmasters, or look for a public speaking class in your area.  Another way to build your confidence is to practice your presentations in front of friends or family members.  You could even record yourself and review the tape to see how you are doing.  The more you practice, the more confident you will become.",0.5465498566627502,9.263284304799303e-79,0.2077922077922078,0.16936125881645345
"I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental.
   I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?","It is very good news that you realize the risks of smoking cigarettes while pregnant and are willing to stop.Thinking about smoking is a typical and frequent reaction to being without the substance.Be creative with what you know about yourself to distract you when this psychological urge comes up.  My suggestions are to imagine smoking if you find this would relieve the sense of wanting to smoke.Or, do the opposite and remind yourself of all the good reasons to not smoke.Also, since you're planning pregnancy then ask your partner for ideas on how to make the psychological feeling to want to smoke, feel less intense.Another suggestion is that your partner is your texting buddy to stop smoking.   With AA groups, a sponsor is always available for the alcoholic who feels distress about the urge to drink.   Having a trusted and caring person to tell about your problem helps in many situations.  Maybe it will help you to stop smoking.Good luck!","Hi, I'm so happy to hear you're planning for a baby. It's great that you're planning to quit smoking. It's also great that you're aware of the mental and emotional aspects of your addiction. The good news is that you can do this. I'm not going to lie, it's hard, but you can do it. The best thing you can do is to get some support. This is a big change and you want to do it right. If you have a doctor, talk to them about your plan. They can provide support and resources. There are also some great phone resources. You can call 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-6699) for free counseling and support. You can also try texting QUIT to 478-478 for free text messaging support. You can also try the SmokeFree app or the QuitGuide app. The key is to have a plan for when you feel the urge to smoke. What are you going to do instead? You can chew gum, go for a walk, or find something else that works for you. You can also try the 4 D's: Delay, Drink water, Deep breathing, and Do something else. You can also try to identify your triggers. What situations, people, or emotions trigger the urge to smoke? Try to avoid them as much as possible. You can also try to find a support buddy. Someone who is also trying to quit or has successfully quit. You can also try some relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing. I hope this helps.

"I found the guy I’m dating on dating websites. He was telling women that they were beautiful. He said it wasn’t him and that the phone was hacked. It has since happened two other times. He says he loves me and I’m the only girl he wants to be with, but I feel he is not telling me the truth.","I would suggest possibly talking about the type of relationship that both of you want to create. For example, you may want a relationship where honesty, listening, compassion, and romanticism are major parts. You could also see what your boyfriend wants.You may also consider taking five minutes to see if he will listen to your feelings about him being on the dating site and whether he can work to learn more about what you are experiencing with asking open-ended questions (not being answered with yes or no) and restating what you are saying to see if he has it right. After that, perhaps you could switch so that you can listen to his perspective for five minutes and learn more about what he is doing by asking open-ended questions.Remember that it takes two people to have  a relationship, so the choice is yours as to whether you choose to stay in the relationship and what kind of relationship you would like to have.","Hi Texas, I agree with you. It's hard to believe that someone could hack into your phone and do things that you don't want them to do. I think it's more likely that you're being lied to. The other thing that concerns me is that your boyfriend has a lot of unanswered questions about why you're dating. It sounds like you're both in a place where you need to be more open with each other. If you're going to be together, you need to be able to trust each other. If you're not sure whether he's telling the truth, that's a huge trust issue. I'd suggest having a conversation with him about your feelings. Tell him that you don't believe the phone was hacked, and that you're feeling unsure about his honesty. If he's truly honest, he'll be open to discussing this with you.

"I’ve been on 0.5 mg of Xanax twice a day for the past month. It hasn't been helping me at all, but when I take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack, it calms me down.

Should I stay on the 0.5mg and deal with the attacks or should I ask to up the dose? I'm afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else.","Do you think you're abusing xanax?It is a highly addictive drug so maybe one reason you feel compelled to take more is bc you already are addicted.Drugs don't do anything helpful in solving life's problems.   Once the effect wears off, the stressful situation is once again waiting for you to address it.Think over your reason for not directly asking your psychologist about upping your dose.Also, do you ever talk about your life problems with this psychologist or only your need for drugs?    The more gradual path to a better life is to not need drugs in the first place.

"I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental.

I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?","Hi. Good for you in planning ahead to do what's healthiest for your baby (and yourself). That's a great first step! It's also good that you are able to identify that it's not always a physical need that's driving the addiction.For the next steps, I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological (or mental) cravings are usually based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if you're consciously trying to quit, you'll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. Well, if I'm on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually I'll give in and eat it.You're going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. That's normal and, for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. That's what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it (""Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now.""), but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.I've suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they're going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.Best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby!","I am not a doctor, but I have had experience quitting smoking and have read about many other ways people have quit smoking.  I think the most important thing is to realize that you are not alone.  Many people have a difficult time quitting smoking.  You can find a support group, either in person or online, that can help you with your addiction.  I have heard that there are even support groups specifically for pregnant women who are trying to quit smoking.  Also, if you are not already doing so, you can try to find a new activity to do in place of smoking.  For example, if you usually go outside to smoke, maybe you can go for a walk instead.  If you are used to smoking after you eat, maybe you can find something else to do, such as brushing your teeth or going for a walk.  Also, there are many different ways that people have quit smoking, such as nicotine patches or gum.  If you are interested in trying any of these, I would recommend talking to your doctor first.  I hope that these ideas are helpful for you.  Good luck!",0.5555311441421509,9.024553503827596e-79,0.15939278937381404,0.18726589746863512
"I'm transgender, I know I am, but I've only told a few friends. I know I can't tell my family because of previous conversations we've had. They just wouldn't accept it.
My gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own. I need some strategies for dealing with it. What should I do?","Hello, and thank you for your question. I am so glad that you reached out for help. I know that the dysphoria can feel nearly impossible to handle, especially since you have limited support from people who accept who you are. You may already know some of these resources, but I am going to share a few. 1. The website www.letsqueerthingsup.com is a blog from a very good writer that I know. His name is Sam Dylan Finch, and he is transgender. He writes about mental health, transgender issues, and many other topics. I know he has frequently written about gender dysphoria and ways to manage it. You may want to check out his site and do a search on there. 2. The website www.everydayfeminism.com employs many transgender writers and several have written about gender dysphoria and have given ideas for managing it. If you search for gender dysphoria on their site, many articles pop up. It may be a good resource for you, especially if you ever feel lonely and start to forget that there are others out there who are like you and have your back. 3. I am not sure where you live, but there are counselors who specialize in affirmative therapy, which is what is recommended for folks who are part of the LGBTQ community. So, if you decide to see a counselor about the dysphoria, try to find one that specifically says they have been trained in the affirmative approach. In addition, feel free to ask questions of the counselor before agreeing to see them for counseling. An ethical counselor would have no problem answering them before having you come in. 4. If there are some LGBTQ resource centers in your area, try to reach out to them and see if there are support groups. Gaining more support from others would be helpful. Sometimes LGBTQ-friendly counselors leave their contact information for people in resource centers. 5. Finally, I know you have not mentioned being depressed or suicidal, but I also know that it is very common for people to consider suicide when they are struggling with dysphoria, dealing with transphobia, etc. If this ever happens to you, please call 911 or the Trans Lifeline. It's free at 877-565-8860. Visit their site at www.translifeline.org. I hope some of these ideas help. Feel free to send another message if you have a follow-up question.Be well....be YOU.Robin J.

"Whenever I leave my girlfriend I get panic attacks. I'm taking medications to control them, but I'm thinking of moving in with her since I get so anxious.","I’m sorry to hear that you are currently experiencing panic attacks. I hope that the medication you have been prescribed has provided you with some relief. Unfortunately, I don’t feel that moving in with your girlfriend would alleviate your anxiety. Although you may feel very anxious about leaving her, your body is reacting to this stressful event in your life in an unhealthy manner. You may be able to render this particular situation but it’s likely that you may experience another panic attack when an additional stressful event arises. Therefore, it is essential that you address the reason for why you are experiencing panic attacks in the first place followed by practicing coping mechanisms in the case that one would arise in the future.Talk therapy has shown to be effective with those affected by anxiety along with breathing exercises and yoga. A trained therapist will be able to assist you in finding the right stress reducing method so that you can reduce the chance of another attack occurring.I wish you the best of luck!

"I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.
I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. While your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard. Talk to them during a non-emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as ""you NEVER listen,"" ""you ALWAYS say..."" and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with ""you"" try using ""I"" by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist, teacher, or school counselor if possible. Most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help.Best of luck to you.","I am so sorry to hear about your experiences. I know how difficult it can be to not have a safe person to talk to about your thoughts and feelings. I am not sure how old you are, but if you are over 13, you may be able to have therapy on your own. You could talk to your school counselor or a local mental health agency about having therapy on your own. It would be a good idea to have someone to talk to who is trained to help you. You could also call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) if you ever feel like you are in crisis. They can help you work through some of the feelings you are experiencing.

Self-harm is a very serious issue and can lead to permanent injury or death. The problem is that the person who self-harms is usually trying to cope with some other issue that is causing them great distress. The self-harm is a way of coping with that distress. It is usually a temporary way of coping, because the distress usually returns and the person then uses self-harm again. The only way to really address this problem is to find out what is causing the distress and to learn other ways of coping with it. You are already on the right track by seeking help. A mental health professional can help you to learn other ways of coping with distressing situations and to understand why you feel the need to self-harm. I wish you the best. Robin J.

"My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board—no more drinking every night.
 The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.  I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. I just feel like I'm so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty. He is a good husband in every other regard.","As exasperated as you feel, and as obvious it is to you that your husband cares more about drinking than being honest with you, changing this is up to him.Does he care that you're upset with him for drinking more than he can handle?Does he care about you more than drinking?Living with an alcoholic, which is how his behavior sounds, is lonely and frustrating.Concentrate on what you like about him as he is now with his drinking.Your happiness matters.  His ignoring of what you're talking about, doesn't mean your requests are unreasonable.Be prepared to learn to live with and accept how he behaves, or not.Avoid the expectation that you can convince him to change.People change only when they realize their life can improve by changing.  He doesn't sound like this, at least now.","I think you are being reasonable.  It's okay to expect honesty from your husband.  I wonder what is motivating him to lie to you about drinking?  Does he know how much it hurts you to find out that he is lying to you?  It's also possible that he is ashamed of his drinking and is trying to hide it.  If he is drinking every night, it might be a good idea to talk to him about seeking help for his alcohol addiction.  You can do this without being judgmental and you can also offer your support.  It's important for him to get help because he might be drinking more than he realizes.  If he is drinking every night, he may be developing a dependency on alcohol.  You can also seek support for yourself.  Al-Anon is a great resource for partners of people who are struggling with alcohol addiction.  You can find more information here:  http://www.al-anon.org/",0.5436395406723022,0.03603479890119818,0.18181818181818185,0.26098942330782154
I have this weird fetish that I'm afraid to open up about it.

"I have been feeling more and more down for over a month. I have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks, but they are almost never triggered by something that I know of.","Answers about our inner lives are most successfully reached from a sense of feeling grounded in oneself.First step is to accept your nervousness and restless sleep.  As often as possible, sleep during daytimes in order for your body to catch up on its need for rest.Accept too about feeling down.  It is normal to feel down once in a while.  From this place of self-acceptance, trust any answers which come up to your mind.  Often answers about complicated topics come in small pieces, not all at once as a whole unit.Also, your description about panic attacks is also completely normal.   They often arise unrelated to particular conditions at a given moment.  They are a healthy symptom your body is trying to expel bad feelings and does this by having the anxiety erupt at times.So, self-acceptance, tolerance of being on a process of clearing out worn out emotional clutter, and sleep at odd times if possible, are all ways to stabilize yourself, which will also feel calm and good!","Hello, and thank you for your question. I am sorry to hear about your panic attacks and trouble sleeping. It is hard to know for sure what is causing these symptoms, but I will try to give you some ideas. First, let me say that I am not a medical doctor, so I cannot diagnose anything. I would recommend seeing a medical doctor or a psychiatrist for a medical evaluation. Sometimes, medical problems can cause anxiety or trouble sleeping. Also, many medications can cause anxiety or trouble sleeping. If there is nothing medically wrong, then we can look at other causes. Panic attacks are a symptom of anxiety. There are many things that can cause anxiety, and they are different for everyone. Some things that can cause anxiety are: stress, trauma, genetics, and medical conditions. There are also many things that can make anxiety worse. Things like caffeine, alcohol, drugs, and stress can make anxiety worse. So, if you are using drugs or alcohol or drinking a lot of caffeine or experiencing a lot of stress, these things can make your anxiety worse. Now, as far as trouble sleeping, there are many things that can cause trouble sleeping. Things like stress, anxiety, medical conditions, medications, caffeine, alcohol, and drugs can all cause trouble sleeping. So, it is possible that the anxiety and trouble sleeping are related. If you are anxious, it is hard to sleep. If you don't sleep well, then it can make anxiety worse. It can become a cycle. So, I would recommend seeing a medical doctor or psychiatrist for a medical evaluation. If there is nothing medically wrong, then you may want to see a counselor or therapist to help you deal with any stress or trauma that may be causing the anxiety. There are also medications that can help with anxiety and trouble sleeping. I hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J.

"I am currently suffering from erectile dysfunction and have tried Viagra, Cialis, etc. Nothing seemed to work. My girlfriend of 3 years is very sexually frustrated. I told her that it is okay for her to have sex with other men. Is that really okay?","Hi, First and foremost, I want to acknowledge your efforts to gain (your) ideal erectile function. If the medications are not working and you have taken them as prescribed, I would encourage you to seek the help of a sex therapist as the dysfunction may be due to a psychological and/or relational issue rather than a physical/medical one. As for your question, only you can answer this. Is it OK? Are you OK with her sleeping with others? Have you thought through what this may look like, feel like, become for you and her? Opening up a relationship is a choice only the people in the relationship can answer. Even then, the answer may change at any point by either of you. I encourage you to also determine what the intention is underneath your telling your girlfriend she could sleep with others. Be clear with the intention and then together have continuous conversations about the expectations of opening up (i.e.: are there any kinds of sex that is off limits, areas of the body where touch or intimacy is not allowed, are uses of safer sex required or not, do you want to know the details or not, so forth). An excellent resource would be the book ""Opening Up"" by Tristan Taormino. I wish you the best of luck!Dr. Lily Zehner, MFT-C","It is hard to know whether it is okay for your girlfriend to have sex with other men because you are not the only person involved. You may be able to make this decision for yourself, but the decision about whether it is okay for her to have sex with other men will have to be made by both of you. You may want to consider whether you would be comfortable if she had sex with other men. Also, you may want to consider whether you are able to be in a relationship where she is having sex with other men. If you are not able to be in a relationship where she is having sex with other men, then you may want to think about ending the relationship. If you want to stay in the relationship, you may want to talk about the reasons why you want her to be able to have sex with other men. You may also want to talk about your concerns about being in a relationship where she is having sex with other men.",0.5506790280342102,1.0704114870360465e-78,0.1769041769041769,0.19681930468531
"I have these dreams of men, and they always seem to try to hurt me. It's gotten so bad that I first wake at 4:30, then 4:45, and finally stay awake by 6:00. I'm always the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake. I hate falling asleep. The longest I've went without sleep is three days.","The good news about your dreams is that your fears are right at the surface of your mind so you can study them and release some of the harm from the terrifying experiences you had which created these bad memories in the first place.The bad news is the feelings themselves are sickening.Probably a therapist would be very helpful for guiding you to unfold these uneasy feelings and their source.This type of deep work is easier with emotional support from someone.  A therapist can give you this plus is knowledgeable about dynamics of someone having been emotionally harmed by another.Or, read a lot online and find out which articles resonate with your emotions.Luckily people are willing to express personal stories of recuperating a sense of peace and safety after being violated by someone.","Hello, and thank you for your question. This sounds like a very difficult problem to have. There are a number of things that could be going on here. One possibility is that you are experiencing some kind of anxiety that is causing the nightmares and sleeplessness. Anxiety can also cause you to wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble getting back to sleep. Another possibility is that you are experiencing trauma or some kind of stressor that is causing these dreams and problems with sleep. It is important to know that the dreams you are having are a normal response to trauma. If you have been through a traumatic event, having nightmares is very common. I would encourage you to see a counselor or a doctor to help you with this. There are medications that can help you sleep and there are some counseling techniques that can help you work through your dreams and any other problems you may be having. I hope this helps.

What makes a healthy marriage last?,It's surprising how many folks talk too much on the subject;It's the same three things that make all relationships work:HonestyTrustRespect(in that order)Most folks fall down on the first :) (*coughcough* THERAPISTS!  Heh heh heh...),"I would say that a healthy marriage lasts because both partners are willing to work on it. It takes two people who are willing to put in the work to make it work. A healthy marriage is not easy, but it is worth it. It is also important to remember that you can not change the other person, you can only change yourself.

"I'm in a long-distance relationship with my ideal man, but I'm not as attracted to him as I should be. Everything else is perfect about him, but I find myself lusting over more attractive men. The next step is marriage, but I want to marry someone who I can wake up to and fall in love with all over again. However, I also don't want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust. Am I asking for too much in the ""perfect guy""? Is there such a thing? Am I truly in love?","Attraction is important but sometimes over-rated. I'm curious about your comment that you are not as attracted as you ""should be"" - What is your measuring stick is for what you are supposed to feel in terms of attraction in a relationship? Do you want to be sexually intimate? Do you enjoy having sex with him? Are you satisfied with your sexual relationship when you are with him? The fact that there is lust for other more attractive men does not necessarily mean anything. There will always be attractive men and more attractive men than your partner and these attractive men will be even more appealing when you are in a long-distance relationship far from the arms of your partner. Loving someone does not mean that you stop being a sexual being who no longer notices and desires attractive men. Attraction results from a number of factors beyond appearance - including the degree to which you feel emotionally open, safe, and connected and how in tune you are with each other's bodies. It sounds like you think very highly of this man ""everything else is perfect about him"". Maybe it is worth spending some more time together in the same place if that is possible before deciding on marriage or that you are not truly in love. ","Hello, and thank you for your question. You are asking some really great questions, and it's hard to give you a simple answer. Let me start with this: There is no such thing as the ""perfect guy."" There are good guys, and there are guys who are a good match for you. I am not sure if you are in love with your current boyfriend or not. I would say that you are attracted to him and you like him, but I am not sure if you are in love with him. You say that you want to marry someone you can wake up to and fall in love with all over again. That's a good thing to want. If you are in love, you will wake up to him every day and fall in love all over again. If you are not in love, you may wake up and feel okay about it, but you won't fall in love. That is not to say that you won't be happy with him. You may very well be. I have been in relationships where I liked the person a lot, but I wasn't in love with them. I was happy with them, but I was also looking for someone I was in love with. I found that person, and now I am in love. So, my question for you is this: What is it that you are looking for? Are you looking for someone who you are in love with, or are you looking for someone who you can be happy with? I would say that you can be happy with someone you are not in love with, but you will not be happy with someone you are in love with if they are not in love with you. I don't know how long you have been in this relationship, but I would say that if you have been together for a while and you still aren't in love with him, then you may never be. I would suggest that you look at your reasons for being in the relationship. Are you in it because you are in love with him, or are you in it because you like him and you are afraid to be alone? Are you in it because you are afraid of being single, or are you in it because you love him? I would suggest that you do some self-exploration. You can do this on your own, but it is often helpful to talk to someone about your feelings. If you want to talk to someone, you can talk to your friends, your family, or you can talk to a therapist. A therapist can help you to understand your feelings and help you to sort through your thoughts. If you decide that you want to be with your boyfriend, you can work on making that relationship better. If you decide that you are not in love with him, you may want to end it. If you decide that you are in love with him, then you can work on making it better. I hope this was helpful. Be well. Robin J.

How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,"This can be a very challenging decision, and it may take time for you to sort through all of your feelings about the relationship and its possible end. Therapy can help you have a space to be completely honest with yourself about your relationship as you grapple with your decision of whether to remain with your boyfriend. Your therapist can ask questions to guide you in uncovering your true feelings about whether this is the right relationship for you, and he or she can support you in whatever decision you come to.","You don't decide to end a relationship.  You decide to end a relationship when you are in a place of no connection with your partner and you've been trying to connect with him for a long time.  You can't force someone to change.  If you're feeling like you're not happy in the relationship and you've tried to communicate with your partner about what you need, and he's not willing to change, then you're in a place of no connection and you're in a place of feeling like you need to end it.  If you're not in that place, and you're still feeling like there is connection and you're still trying to connect, then you don't have a decision to make.  You just have to be patient and keep trying.  If you're in a place where you're feeling like you're not happy and you've tried to communicate with your partner and he's not willing to change, then you have a decision to make.  You can end the relationship or you can stay in it.  You can't force him to change.  He has to want to change.  If you want to stay in the relationship, you can try to accept him as he is, but it's not going to be easy.  If you want to end it, you can end it.  But, you can't force him to change.",0.5250487327575684,1.0813738768618516e-78,0.18289085545722714,0.28912985354473203
"My older brother (in his 60s) started dating a lady with Asperger's. She is hyper-sexual and flirty. She does not understand boundaries.

"We’ve been together almost three years. We argue and he ends it by telling me he doesn’t love me. It's hurtful because I am all about resolving the problem, and he dwells on the issue even if I drop what he's done and just swallow my pride and say I am sorry. How can this be resolved? We have kids, and I don't want a broken family because we can't communicate.","You can't fix this by yourself, but I applaud you for trying. One person working hard in a relationship can make things better for a while., but in the long haul you need two people giving some effort. I'm reading between your lines here and I wonder if your need to keep the family together is getting you to apologize when you've done nothing wrong and ignore things you've felt hurt by. I sense that you're doing all the work...that it's not balanced. I have worked with many couples and I've learned never to underestimate what kind of change is possible; anything is possible. But in order for change in a couple to occur, you need two people who are both willing to own their choices and behaviours, and who have empathy. Your boyfriend doesn't appear to have these components; he pushes you away and blames you when he's done something hurtful.Can you be honest with yourself about what's happening? I encourage you to sit down with a trusted friend or therapist and look at what you have here and what your options are. I wish you well.","Hi Houston, I'm sorry you're going through this. It's hard to be in a relationship where you feel you can't talk about things, or where your partner uses the threat of leaving to get his way. It's not okay for him to do that. I can see that you want to work things out, and I think you should. You and your partner are in a position where you have kids together, and that's a really good reason to work on your relationship. I'd like to offer a few thoughts, and then I'll offer a few questions for you to consider. Firstly, it's important to remember that you can't control your partner's actions. You can only control your own. You can't make him stop saying hurtful things, or make him stop dwelling on issues. You can only make a choice to walk away from that behaviour and not engage with it. It's okay to say, ""I don't want to talk to you right now. I'll talk to you in a few hours (or days) when you are ready to talk to me respectfully."" And then walk away. It's okay to protect yourself and your children from hurtful behaviour. Secondly, it's okay to have different styles of communicating. You say you're ""all about resolving the problem"" and he ""dwells on the issue"". It's possible you have a different style of communicating. Maybe you'd like to resolve the issue right away and move on, and he needs some time to process his feelings. Maybe he needs some time to process, and then he's ready to talk about it. This doesn't mean he's not willing to work things out, it just means he needs some time to process. Thirdly, I'm wondering if you're swallowing your pride because you're afraid of the consequences of not swallowing your pride. If you're afraid of being alone or of not having a family, that's a good reason to swallow your pride. But if you're swallowing your pride because you're afraid of being yelled at or being told hurtful things, then it's not okay. You deserve to be treated with respect. Now, here are a few questions for you to consider: 1. What are your needs in this relationship? What do you need from him in order to feel happy and fulfilled? 2. What are your non-negotiables? What behaviours are you not willing to tolerate? 3. What are his needs? What does he need from you? 4. What are his non-negotiables? 5. How do you want your children to see you and your relationship? What kind of example do you want to set for them? I hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC",0.5815252065658569,7.775008321581545e-79,0.1698389458272328,0.2919389246755173

That is a scary situation for a parent. Do you know if the child has been evaluated by a mental health professional? Early treatment is often the key. A professional will be able to help the child learn how to control their anger and mend the troublesome actions into more appropriate responses. Have you addressed your concerns with the child's other parent? There could be contributing factors in his life that could be causing these issues (exposure to violence, sexual/physical abuse, drug use, stressful events in his life, etc.). It is important that these factors are identified so that they can either be eliminated and/or reduced. I wouldn't hesitate to have him evaluated (if he hasn't been already) and to ensure that he is getting the help that he needs whether it be medication and/or therapy.

I feel really uncomfortable when I have people's attention.  It makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class. Can I get over this social anxiety?,"you can learn lots of skills/techniques to feel more confident in what you need to do that will decrease your anxious response for sure! :) And  you can also learn how to work with your personality that may not like the attention. You may find that ""talking"" to others through the internet is more comfortable and you are great at it, or that you love one on one talking but aren't really made for group talking. There is a place in this world for you either way! Public speaking skills can be practiced in speech class, or toastmaster group, they will give you practice in a safe environment where the cool kids or cutest boy aren't ready to laugh at you.  What topics are you interested in and what groups can you do a little speaking up? Maybe in your small group at church try and raise you hand to share your opinion, or maybe your Girl Scout troop? Look around for a peer and one adult who you like to hear speak out, ask them to share with you 2 things that help them feel comfortable speaking in public. Check out some Ted Talks and see how they share in groups.

It is absolutely normal to feel nervous before a therapy session. Therapy can be a very vulnerable process, and it can take time to build a trusting relationship with your therapist. It is also normal to feel shaky after a therapy session. Processing difficult emotions can be exhausting. I would encourage you to talk to your therapist about how you are feeling.

"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","From your initial description, I would say that your mother is ""Maloriented"". In this stage of Alzheimer's individuals tend to be blaming and difficult to deal with. They may often hide or throw things away and then blame family members for this. In addition, if they are incontinent, they may blame a leaky roof or something else when they are wet. You are correct that this is not her fault, but often for family members this does not make it any easier for you to cope. I strongly suggest that you learn communication strategies that will help you to communicate with your mother in a way that lets her work through the difficulties associated with the disease. I always suggest Validation techniques to family members.In addition, you need to give yourself some kind attention and take time out from your circumstances as needed. You need to be able to center yourself and come to acceptance that this is your mother's illness that is the problem, not her and certainly not you.","This is a great question.  It is common for caregivers to feel frustrated and angry, but then feel guilty for feeling that way.  It is important to remember that these feelings are normal, and it is important to take care of yourself.  Caregivers often forget to take care of themselves, and this can lead to burnout.  Caregiver support groups can be a great resource.  It is helpful to be able to share your feelings with others who are going through similar experiences.  I also encourage caregivers to make sure they are taking care of themselves.  This can include making time for yourself to do things that you enjoy, asking for help when you need it, and talking to someone about your feelings.  There are also many resources online for caregivers.  The Alzheimer's Association is a great place to start.",0.551130473613739,0.02962763154152204,0.1592356687898089,0.22950503378315343
"I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it.

I know what I'm doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change. How do I stop this behavior and thought process?","Good for you on your keen awareness of your difficulties and your willingness to change!The type of change you'd like to achieve is possible, and since a change in self-confidence and self-love is deep rooted, this comes about gradually and slowly.Keep understanding yourself during your moments of doubt and anxiety.  Its fine to feel terrible and certainly better to know you feel insecure than to act upon the insecurity by being with men who take advantage of you.Everyone needs to feel loved and recognized.Until you attract a partner who will love and appreciate you, develop relationships with co-workers and classmates, neighbors, so that you have some quality of giving and being given by someone.It is a way to nurture yourself and another person until your strength and self-belief grow bigger.","Hello, and thank you for your question. This is a very common question. Many people struggle with similar issues. You are not alone. The good news is that there is help. I will try to provide some thoughts here, but I do want to encourage you to seek out a counselor. This is something that a counselor can help you with. First, I want to say that you have already taken a very important step by recognizing that you have a problem and that you want to change. That is a very important first step. Now, let's talk about what might be going on. You are right that you seem to gravitate toward unavailable men. This is very common. Many of us do this. Why do we do this? It is because we have learned that this is what we can expect from others. It is what we have learned about ourselves. We have learned that we are not worthy of a good relationship. We have learned that we can't trust others. We have learned that we can't trust ourselves. So, how do we change this? Well, the first step is to recognize that this is what is going on. You have done that. The second step is to recognize that you are not worthless, or unlovable, or untrustworthy. That is not true. You are a human being, and you are worthy of love and respect. The third step is to find a therapist who can help you work through all of this. It is hard to change these things on your own. A therapist can help. I hope this was helpful. Be well. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC",0.5206575393676758,7.004605046697898e-79,0.13238770685579196,0.21074886973454188
"I was with my friends fishing by a pond. I found a frog and stabbed it with my friend's knife. I'm not sure why I did it. My friends saw me do it it and were shocked and got really mad at me.

Now if someone brings it up I get really upset and panicked. I don't know why I feel like this.

"I’m a man, and I’m soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but it’s been happening a lot. I don't know what to do.","Hello, and thank you for your question. When faced with these kinds of difficult challenges, I usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be. Indeed, it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we don't feel very content with our lives. Perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions: What kind of person do I want to be deep in my heart? What kind of character do I want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching? How would I want others to describe me? Let's say that you want others to see you as being authentic, and YOU also value authenticity as something you want to live by. You may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now. That you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart. This is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation. So please, try not to feel alone. We all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc. And I am not just talking about being unaccepted by others, but a person may have a VERY hard time accepting themselves. Thinking about your values and living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom, but I won't lie, it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time. For example, someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for, even if that means people may disapprove. That may cause a lot of pain, but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity. It may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy, which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them. I would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are... both as an individual and as someone's fiancé.Above all, I wish you well in this journey. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC","I'm glad that you're recognizing that you're being unfaithful to your fiancé and yourself. It's hard to be in a relationship when you're not being honest with yourself or your partner. It's important to be honest with your fiancé about what's going on. If you're not comfortable telling them yourself, there are counselors who can help you with this. You may also want to seek out a therapist who can help you explore your sexuality.

   My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules. She is trying to control my life. What should I do?","That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now. The first thing to under is that you can’t change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior. The thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions.  You may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan. The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior. Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy. Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack.  There are ways you can deal with controlling parents – and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you’ll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they’re trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you’re losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust. There aren’t any quick tips on how to deal with parents who want to control you; you need to find strategies that are geared to your specific family situation.

This is a tough situation, and I am not sure I can tell you what to do, but I can offer some thoughts. First, it sounds like you may be in a situation where you have to make a decision for yourself. This is not easy. It is often hard to make decisions when they affect other people. You may want to talk with your dad about this. You may want to tell him that you are feeling pressured to do track, and that you are not happy. You may want to tell him that you want to do track because you want to, not because you feel obligated. I think most parents would want their children to be happy. The second thing I would think about is whether you are able to do track and still do the other sports. If you are able to do all of them, then maybe you can do that. If you are not able to, then you will have to make a decision about which ones you want to do. If you decide to stop doing track, then you may have to tell your coach and your teammates. I think most people would understand if you told them that you were not able to do track anymore.

"I can't seem to feel any emotion except anxiety, not even for myself.","Empathy is the ability
to tap into our own experience to help us connect with others in order to be
aware of how they are experiencing life. 
It is a skill that we learn with practice and refine as we become mature.
If you are feeling anxious, maybe you are able to understand better others who
are going trough anxiety.  But I wonder
if instead of feeling empathy, you may just want to find ways to reduce your
anxiety.  A good idea is to be very aware
of your anxiety triggers, and once you identify them explore other ways you
could react. ¿Sera normal que no sienta empatía?Parece que no puedo experimentar ninguna otra emoción que
no sea ansiedad, ni si quiera por mí misma. Empatía es la habilidad de usar tus propias
experiencias para conectarte con otros y estar consciente de la manera que
ellos experimentan la vida.  Es una
destreza interpersonal que aprendemos y refinamos con la práctica y según maduramos
como personas.  Si te estás sintiendo
ansioso, tal vez puedas comprender mejor como otra persona experimenta momentos
de ansiedad.  Pero me pregunto si en
lugar de estar buscando sentir empatía, realmente quisieras reducir tus niveles
de ansiedad.  Una buena manera es estar consciente
que activa la ansiedad, y ya que lo identifiques, explora que otras reacciones
pudieras tener.","It's possible that you are feeling the emotion of anxiety for yourself.  If you're not sure what you're feeling, it may be helpful to see a therapist who can help you sort through your emotions and how you're experiencing them.",0.4187443256378174,3.649508610958646e-80,0.1098901098901099,0.054614964500273075

Items to write would be what were you doing before you felt this way, did you eat and what, what time of day is it, how much sleep did you get that night, etc... This can help you identify any triggers. Further assessment can be made by a health care professional. It does sound like you are experiencing some symptoms of anxiety.","Anxiety can be a tricky thing. It's a normal human emotion that we all experience to some degree, but it can also get out of hand and interfere with our lives. There are many things that can be done to address anxiety, but the first step is to understand the triggers and patterns of your anxiety.

"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","It is challenging to see one's parents age and to cope with the new demands.  Your mom means a lot to you, and that is why you get easily frustrated.  I'm guessing that it is not that she is making you do work or that her expectations are non-important to you because if that were the case, you would not feel any guilt.  Accepting the new stage will help you cope with the changes.  Take a deep breath every time you feel frustrated and think of the good times you shared with your mom before her getting Alzheimer's.  Remember that your mom as she was is no longer and that she has reverted to a more delicate phase.  Also, schedule time for yourself and do things that help you relax.  Caretaking of an elderly parent can take a toll on you, and it is essential to incorporate self-care.  Finally, look for an Alzheimer's support group in your area that will help you connect with other people going through the same thing.  You are a good daughter, and your mom is lucky to have you in her life.Sincerely, Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling","This is a difficult situation.  It is normal to feel frustrated and angry.  You may also feel sad and hopeless.  All of these emotions are okay.  You may be able to reduce your frustration by focusing on the fact that your mother's behaviors are a result of her illness and not a reflection of her feelings toward you.  It may also be helpful to talk with others who are in similar situations.  Support groups are a good way to find others who can offer support and understanding.  You may also want to consider seeing a counselor yourself to help you process your feelings.  Lastly, try to remember that you are doing the best you can and that is enough.",0.5781952738761902,1.1402701827242994e-78,0.18808777429467083,0.2062845595256601

"I'm scared that I am with this man so I won't be alone. He should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case, and I don’t want to hurt him.","While not wanting to be alone may not be the best reason to be in a relationship, it is probably more common and normal a reason than you think.  Since you seem to care about your friend (""don't want to hurt him""), I imagine there are many other reasons that you are together.  I suggest that you talk about this open-heartedly with each other.  The idea of being afraid of being alone sounds like an honest starting place.  Don't try to ""figure out"" whether you should be with him.  Just talk.  The communication is likely to shine light on deepening connection for BOTH OF YOU.In the meantime, your idea that you don't deserve him is rooted in a ""core lie"" that you are telling yourself.  You can read about ""core lies"" and much more in my book, Living Yes, a Handbook for Being Human.  Check out www.LivingYes.org.Be easy on yourself.  You are deserving!~Mark","Hi.

"I keep having these random thoughts that I don't want. Things like ""you aren't worth anything."" I know they're my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it.
   What is wrong with me, and how can I stop having these thoughts?","Many people have thoughts like those you describe, and often it feels like someone else is saying it because they are things that may have been said to you when you were very young.  When young children hear negative things about themselves they tend to internalize these negative ideas and to form negative core beliefs.  The good news is we can learn to stop these thoughts and to replace them with healthier thoughts.  The first step is to catch yourself when you are thinking these thoughts, and to stay ""stop!""; then replace it with another thought.  So for instance, maybe you fail a test or get rejected by a romantic interest.  You catch yourself saying ""you aren't worth anything"". Stop this thought, and replace it with ""You didn't do as well on that test as you would have liked.  Let's figure out how you can do better next time.""  Or ""she may not want to go out with you, but someone else will"". So the idea is to develop a voice of a ""friend"", who can tell you the kind of things you would say to your own best friend.  You might also pick up the book, Feeling Good, by David Burns. He gives many tips for how to change Negative Self Talk.","It sounds like you are experiencing some self-critical thoughts that you are aware of and would like to reduce.

A therapist can help you to work through these thoughts and develop strategies for coping with them. One thing you can do right now is try to pay attention to the situations in which you are having these thoughts. Is there a particular time of day or a particular situation in which you are having these thoughts? Also, what are you doing in the moments that you are having these thoughts?

"I'm a guy. If I don't like girls, nor do I like guys, does that mean I'm gay?","Hi, and thanks for your question. I agree with my colleagues about researching asexuality, but I want too add a couple of things about that:Here is a website that you can start with to get some information about asexuality - http://www.asexuality.org/home/There are a whole lot of myths surrounding asexuality. One is that people who are asexual have absolutely no interest in sex, and that is not always the case. There are variations of asexuality. Some people who are asexual have an interest in sex and others don't. Also, once you read more on this topic, you may find that you don't connect with asexuality either, and that is okay. Our society usually thinks of sexual orientations as only being straight, gay, lesbian, or bisexual, but the truth is there are many variations of sexual orientations. Keep exploring. There is a good chance that there is a community of people who feel like you do. Finally, labels are important for a lot of things, but labeling ourselves can sometimes lead to some painful feelings. Try not to feel pressured to label yourself too quickly. This is your journey. Your experience. Take all the time you need. You may never feel the need to label how you feel, and that is okay, too. Hope this helps. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC  ","Not necessarily.  You might be straight, but just not like the types of people who are attracted to you.  Or you might be gay, or bisexual, or pansexual, or asexual, or... there are many terms to describe the way you feel.  But it's not necessarily one or the other.  It's not always black and white.  I would encourage you to explore your feelings, see what feels most comfortable to you.  And if you're still not sure, you can always ask a therapist.",0.5450009107589722,4.953844623223934e-79,0.15923566878980894,0.12875357462402565
"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years. I have been on medication, but lately my depression has felt worse. Can counseling help?","Thank you for asking this important question. I find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment. Step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change. Congratulations you did the first step! You are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question. Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression. The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with  Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events. Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression.  The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment. As counselors, we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time. However, remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well being. I hope this was helpful, and good luck with your treatment journey. ","Yes, counseling can be a very effective treatment for depression and anxiety.  I would encourage you to find a therapist who is trained in treating depression and anxiety with a treatment that is evidence based, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, or behavioral activation therapy.  If you are interested in learning more about the different types of treatments for depression and anxiety, you can visit the website for the Academy of Cognitive Therapy (www.academyofct.org) or the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (www.abct.org).  If you are interested in finding a therapist in your area, you can visit the website for the Psychology Today (www.psychologytoday.com) or the Good Therapy (www.goodtherapy.org) websites.",0.5436643362045288,7.083898686537329e-79,0.1969230769230769,0.1761381100057975

"I broke up with him three weeks ago because I felt that he needed to be more respectful. He has since had a rebound relationship. He says he loves and misses me but refuses to see me. He says it's going to be too difficult to see me. Every time we talk, it feels like I'm being pushy to see him. He used to be so madly in love with me, but now, it seems like he couldn’t care less. I think I'm running him away.","Hi Kansas,I think your first instinct was good; you broke up with him. You deserve respect, but right now you're not acting as if you deserve it when you push to see him as he's moving on with a new relationship. It's appropriate now for you to respect that relationship and listen to what he says he wants, which is space. Do you think he's going to be any different with her? This a common, unfounded fear we have. I wonder if maybe you miss the feeling of being in love and having a partner more than you miss him. The bottom line is you can't make someone love you, and you can't make someone be loving towards you, because how someone treats you (and the choices they make) has everything to do with who they are, and nothing to do with who you are. I hope you gather support from others and move on in hope and strength for your own future.","It sounds like you're very confused about how to handle this situation. It's hard to tell from your description whether your ex is in a rebound relationship or if he's actually in love with someone else. Either way, it seems like he's trying to distance himself from you, and I think it's important to respect that. It's possible that he's not sure how to handle the situation, and if you continue to push him to see you, it may make it more difficult for him to figure out what he wants. If he wants to see you, he will.

"My dad cheated on my mom for 13 years. I cannot stop obsessing over the fact that my boyfriend might be cheating on me even when I know he isn't. I have full access to his phone, social media, and e-mails. I never find anything, but I'm obsessed with constantly checking just in case. How do I stop this? It's driving a wedge between us.","Hi Greenville, I respect that you're owning your own overreactions, and that you want to give your boyfriend the respect he deserves. The truth is that some people cheat, and some don't, and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they can't be trusted.The answer here is in two different areas. Basically, if you want to feel differently (more trusting, in your case), you look at your thoughts, and your behaviours.Your thoughts are stuck... like tires in deep ruts in the road. These thoughts are only habits, they don't reflect the truth. Fear is probably whispering in your ear things like ""everyone cheats"", or "" you're not enough for him"". Once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you, picture those words in red next time they come up. Ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought (there won't be much...perhaps none), and what is the evidence that doesn't support it (I know lots of good men, I know I deserve love and loyalty, there is no sign of infidelity...). You're learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear. That's the first half. Practise these thoughts.The rest of the work is in your behaviours. Act as though you trust him. Force yourself to not check or interrogate, and the less you check, the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel. Acting ""as if"" something if true strangely helps us believe it.It's possible to change the way we think, and this is turn changes the way we feel. Try this to start, and see a therapist for support and cognitive behavioural therapy if you want to dive more deeply into why this is happening and how to stop it. Good luck!","I think you are confusing being obsessing over your boyfriend cheating with your dad cheating. I'm not sure why you would be obsessing over your boyfriend cheating because of your dad cheating. You can't control your boyfriend's actions, but you can control your own.

Sounds to me like you are being treated more like a child than an adult.  It's time to learn about healthy boundaries and being treated like an adult.

You'll be so glad you did!","I'm so sorry you're going through this!  It's really hard to be in a situation like this, and I can imagine how draining it must be.  It's also really difficult to have your child exposed to this, too.  You are not alone in feeling trapped and powerless, and I would encourage you to reach out to someone who can help you figure out what your options are.  If you can't reach out to someone, here are a few things that may help you in the meantime:1.  Remind yourself that you are not the person your parents are calling you.  You are a good person, and they are trying to hurt you with words.  They don't get to define you. 2.  Try to find something to focus on that is outside of the situation.  If you are at home, it may be difficult to find something that is not related to your family, but you could try to focus on your breathing, or something that you can see outside of your home, or even a song that you can listen to in your head.  If you are at work, you could try to focus on your work, or your breathing, or the people around you.  Try to find something that is not related to the situation that you can focus on. 3.  If you are able to, try to find someone that you can talk to about what is going on.  Sometimes just having someone listen to you can make a big difference. 4.  Try to find a place where you can be alone and have some time to yourself.  Even if it's just for a few minutes, try to find a place where you can be by yourself and breathe and think about something that is not related to the situation. 5.  Try to find something that you can do that makes you feel good.  This could be something small, like eating a snack or drinking a glass of water, or something bigger, like watching a movie or reading a book. 6.  Remind yourself that you are not alone, and that there are people who care about you and want to help you.  Try to find someone that you can talk to, or a website that you can visit.  There are lots of resources out there for people who are going through what you are going through. 7.  Try to find something that you can do that makes you feel good.  This could be something small, like eating a snack or drinking a glass of water, or something bigger, like watching a movie or reading a book. 8.  Try to find a place where you can be alone and have some time to yourself.  Even if it's just for a few minutes, try to find a place where you can be by yourself and breathe and think about something that is not related to the situation. 9.  Try to find something that you can do that makes you feel good.  This could be something small, like eating a snack or drinking a glass of water, or something bigger, like watching a movie or reading a book. 10.  Remind yourself that you are not alone, and that there are people who care about you and want to help you.  Try to find someone that you can talk to, or a website that you can visit.  There are lots of resources out there for people who are going through what you are going through.",0.5255272388458252,2.7360752049538096e-155,0.10541310541310542,0.21809895833333331
What makes a healthy marriage last?,"In my mind, a healthy marriage has two participants, meaning both people participate equally in the intimate connection of marriage. An unequal participation comes in many forms, such as one person checking out of conversations when it becomes emotional, or speaking over and for each other in these conversations. Couple’s should strive for engagement and support, but doing it in a way that works for each person individually. I hope this helps.","A healthy marriage lasts because both partners are committed to making it work.  The relationship is a priority for both people and they are both willing to put in the work necessary to make it a strong, loving relationship.  This means communicating in healthy ways, respecting one another, and being able to work through conflicts in a healthy way.  It also means that both people are able to have their needs met in the relationship and that they are both satisfied with the relationship.",0.5834790468215942,5.096403114207827e-155,0.178343949044586,0.17076502732240437
"I know that I need to get past my feelings for this person I fell in love with, but t's so difficult to move on because he showed me feelings I've never felt before. 

I feel like I don't  want to be without my genuine love for him, but logically, I know I need to be without him. I can't discuss this with anybody in my life because the conditions surrounding our love are considered  ""wrong"" by a lot of people.

How can I get myself to just move on?","It's difficult to move on and let go, especially when you've experienced things for the first time with someone, or feelings you've never felt before, as you said.I like the fact that you are looking at your situation ""logically"".  Feelings can take time to fade, but you seem to understand, even if it is subconsciously, that it's the feelings he stirred up in you that are keeping you tied to him, not necessarily the person himself. Realize that you can and will experience those feelings again with another person - the RIGHT person. Don't hold onto someone who is wrong for you just because of something like this. You're wanting those feelings and wanting a relationship - but with him necessarily? Or with anybody? You said you don't want to be without your love for him - not you don't want to be without him. In fact, you said you know you need to be without him. It seems like it's the LOVE that you can't let go of, and the feelings. Not the person. Trust me, you will find that again. Take some time to let this fade. Don't try to force him or anyone else into a role that is meant for someone else. Cherish the memories and the experiences you had. Sounds like it's been a valuable learning and growth experience for you, but you have your own reasons, and I don't know what they are, for thinking this person isn't good for you. Trust your gut instinct and be glad you've had this relationship. Not all are meant to last. But all shape you into the person you are and will become, and all teach us important lessons.","The most important thing to remember is that you are not broken. You are not doing anything wrong. You are human and you are feeling. And feelings are not something we can just turn off. We can learn to manage them, but they are not inherently bad or wrong. They are a natural part of being human. You have had a very special connection with this person. I'm not talking about a physical connection. I'm talking about the connection that happens in the soul. And I'm not talking about a spiritual connection, but rather a connection to who you are as a person. You have had a relationship that has shown you a different side of yourself. You have been loved in a way that you have never been loved before. This is a good thing. It's important that you remember that. You are struggling because you are trying to deny a part of yourself. You are trying to deny your own feelings and your own experiences. You are trying to deny your own soul. And you can't do that. You can't deny who you are. The best way to move on is to accept yourself. Accept your feelings. Accept your experiences. Accept your soul. You can't move on until you do that. You can't move on until you accept who you are. I know it's hard. I know it's painful. But it's necessary.

"I have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and I just had my first kiss five months ago. I’m worried that, at this rate, I won’t have a boyfriend for a very long time. The problem is that I want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, I don't want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex. I have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. Luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. I feel dirty by doing this, but I feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal.

Most people are surprised when they find out that I am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think I am really good looking. I am tall, I play lots of sports, and I get excellent grades in school. I am in my first year of university right now, and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest. It bothers me. Most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already. I feel like I will be single forever sometimes.","I think that every person who has been single for any extended period of time has felt the same worries - myself included. Since relationships are so important to us we fear not having them and being single. It is similar to fearing that we won't ever get a good job when we have been out of work for awhile or fearing that we won't be healthy when we have been sick. We fear these things because they are so important - not because these fears are realistic or true! There is immense pressure put on young single people from peers and media to conform to ideas of what is normal and to meet expectations in terms of sexual experience, dating, etc. While some people may judge an adult who is a virgin - others will respect your choices and feel even more attracted to you because of your choices. Experimenting with sex, so long as you are being safe and respectful is also completely okay and normal. Since expectations vary and we can't be happy if we are always comparing ourselves to other people, we need to ultimately trust that being who we are and building a loving relationship with ourselves is the key to meeting someone who will cherish us for all the ways that we are special and unique, virgin or not. When we are able to really accept ourselves and trust in our loveableness (not a real word but you get what I mean!) then meeting someone special is simply a matter of time and effort - putting ourselves out in the world in situations where we are likely to meet other single people looking for relationships. When you are most afraid of being alone - remember that this fear is simply a reminder of how much you value relationships. Use that passion about wanting relationships to build the best relationship you can with yourself and then one day soon some lucky person will stumble into your life and benefit immensely from your passion and your ability to be authentically who you are rather than pretending to be ""normal"" or whatever that is anyway. Hope this helps! ",I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with this.  I can't tell you how many times I've heard people say they feel like they're behind because they don't have a relationship.  It's really not true.  I think it's important to remember that everyone is on their own journey and there is no timeline for things like this.  I've been in relationships for years and years and I'm still a virgin.  I'm also in my mid 30s.  I don't think you're behind at all.  I think you're right on time.  You have a lot of other great things going on in your life and you're in university.  That's important.  You're also a virgin and you want to wait for the right person to have sex with.  That's awesome.  I'm not sure why you feel like you need to do things that you don't want to do just to seem normal.  That's a really unhealthy thought.  I would suggest talking to a therapist about your feelings.  I'm sure they could help you to work through this.,0.548052966594696,4.6176892273881927e-79,0.13693693693693693,0.16074310287706559

I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.,"First I think we have to acknowledge that you are doing something amazing.  You are putting yourself out there and becoming a Water Safety Instructor.   We often times will focus on the negative and forget about the positive.  Next, you had an incident where someone pointed something out which may have caused embarrassment.  Whether or not it was malicious on his part I think the important thing to focus on is what is called ""Common Humanity"".  Common Humanity is one of the three elements of self-compassion.  Common humanity essentially recognizes that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the shared human experience.  While you may have had this embarrassing moment at this time, that boy may have had an embarrassing moment another day.  We all have embarrassing moments.  When we recognize that we do not suffer in isolation then we are able to move past that suffering.  Additionally another element to self-compassion is self-kindness.  My question is why must you forgive yourself?  Rather, be kind to yourself for learning an amazing new talent.","Hi, I am so sorry that this happened. I am sure it was a very embarrassing moment. It sounds like this boy did not handle himself very well. He should not have told you that your top was displaying everything.

You included a lot of things that you don't have. Is there anyway that you can have some freedom for a few hours a week, at least? A lot of times stay at home moms have groups when they meet at different public places where their children can play together and they can talk together. I don't know how old your child or children is/are, but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the future.I wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you. I don't know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things. I wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted? If you can sort out some possible answers to that, maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happen.Also, again depending on the age of your children, some parents can do things while the children are sleeping, even if you are in the same room. For example, if your children are sleeping for about two hours, maybe 30 minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do.","It sounds like you are very overwhelmed with the responsibilities of being a stay-at-home mom and that you are feeling very isolated and alone.  I would recommend that you reach out to your support system (friends and family) and ask for help.  You may also want to look into community resources such as a parent support group where you can meet other moms and make new friends.  You may also want to look into a counseling service if you are feeling overwhelmed with anxiety or depression.  If you are unable to find someone to watch your child while you go out, you can also look into local resources for childcare.  You are not alone and there are people out there who can help.  Best of luck to you!",0.5668979287147522,7.119643389484687e-79,0.1793478260869565,0.17373646209386284
"I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I can't afford to live alone.

My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules. She is trying to control my life. What should I do?","That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now.  The first thing to under is that you can’t change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior.  The thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions.  You may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan. The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior.  Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy.  Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack.  There are ways you can deal with controlling parents – and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you’ll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they’re trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you’re losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust.

","It's not easy to live with your parents and still feel like you're an adult.  If you're in your 20s and still living with them, it's probably because you're still figuring out what you want to do with your life.  That's okay.  It's also okay to have a job that doesn't pay very much, if you're still figuring out what you want to do.  If you're in your 20s and still living with your parents, I'm assuming you're not in school.  You could start by making a plan with your parents about what you want to do with your life and when you plan to move out.  For example, you could tell your parents that you're going to work for a year or two, save up some money, and then move out.  If you're still in school, you could tell them that you're going to finish school and then move out.  If you don't have a plan, it's easy for parents to get frustrated with you and try to control your life.  If you have a plan, it's easier for them to understand that you're not just hanging out at home doing nothing.  It's also important for you to remember that your parents are not trying to control your life.  They are just trying to help you and want you to be happy.  They want to make sure you have a place to live and food to eat, and they want you to be successful.  If you have a plan, they will probably be much more willing to support you and give you the space you need to make your own decisions.  If you don't have a plan, they may feel like they have to step in and try to help you.  If you're not sure what you want to do with your life, that's okay.  You can talk to your parents about that too.  They may be able to help you figure out what you want to do.  They may be able to give you some ideas or help you find a job.  If you're not sure what you want to do, that's okay.  It's okay to take some time to figure it out.  Just make sure you have a plan and that you're making progress towards your goal.  If you're not sure where to start, you could talk to a career counselor or a therapist.  They can help you figure out what you want to do with your life and help you make a plan.  Good luck!",0.5816123485565186,1.4469536684712383e-78,0.17344173441734417,0.2329934395892231

"I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out.

What should I do?","Keep doing the crossdressing since you like it.Your problem sounds more a matter of timing and reason to tell the girl about it.Not keeping a secret is a good attitude regarding meaningful parts of your life.  Usually our relationship partner is someone whom we trust as a safe person to know all about us.Once you feel at ease with your potential partner then bring up your crossdressing.  Based on their handling of this intimate part of your life, you will know more as to whether or not you feel more or less drawn to them.Secrets held within a relationship usually get worse with time.   The person who feels unsafe in truly being and stating themselves eventually will end up feeling ashamed of parts of them which prior to the relationship, felt good or at least not worrisome.","Hello, and thank you for your question. I have to admit, I am not sure what you mean by ""that seems to bother girls I date or ask out."" Do you mean that you have asked them out and they said no? Or, do you mean that you have asked them out and they said yes, but then you didn't tell them about your cross-dressing and they found out and were bothered by it? The answer to your question really depends on what you are asking. If you are asking if you should stop cross-dressing, I would say, ""No."" I think it is important to be true to yourself. If you are happy doing it, then you should continue to do it. I am not sure if you are asking if you should tell your partner about it, or if you are asking if you should continue to date people who don't want to be with you because of it. If you are asking if you should tell your partner about it, I would say, yes, you should. It is important to be open and honest with your partner. If you are asking if you should date someone who doesn't want to be with you because of your cross-dressing, then I would say, no. You deserve to be with someone who loves you for who you are. I think it is important to remember that everyone is different. Some people will be okay with your cross-dressing, and some people won't. You cannot change who you are, but you can decide who you want to be with. I would say, don't hold back. Be who you are. It may take a while to find the right person, but they are out there.

What can I do?,"Our body reacts to stress typically by breathing more shallowly, increasing our heart rate and tensing our muscles - so one thing that I find really effective is to try to do the opposite of that, which sends the signal to our mind that we are relaxed. So that means, taking slower, fuller breaths and trying to relax any areas where we might be gripping our muscles. Check out meditation apps such as 'Breathe', which can talk you through a relaxing breath exercise. I recommend using the app daily, whether you feel stressed or not, and then also using it when you re feeling particular moments of stress - that way you are practicing the skill when you feel calm(wish) and it'll be ready and able to help you when stress hits hard.","It's good that you are asking this question because it shows you are aware of the stress you are experiencing and are willing to do something about it.  I would recommend that you first identify what is causing the stress.  Once you know that, you can then begin to implement coping skills to help you manage it.  There are many different coping skills that you can use, but here are a few to get you started:ExerciseDeep breathingMindfulness meditationYogaProgressive muscle relaxationTime management skillsIf you are interested in learning more about these coping skills, you can check out the free online course ""Coping with Stress"" at www.helpingwithstress.org.",0.5360581278800964,9.998072534803731e-79,0.15702479338842976,0.18974009694555782
They're calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as I do. I'm tired of being called names. What should I do?,"It sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner, correct? Communication is key to any relationship. I would recommend speaking with your friends face-to-face to address why they feel your behavior is concerning. In-person contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts, emails or any written response can be misconstrued. Be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded. If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling, maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly. Especially if this friendship is valuable to you. However, make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them. On the other hand, if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded, it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship. Not all friendships are healthy ones. And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it.I hope you are able to get this matter sorted. Best of luck!","It's difficult to be called names, especially if you don't feel like you deserve them.  It's also difficult to know how to respond to them, especially when you feel like you are being unfairly targeted.  One thing you can do is try to talk to your friends about this.  You can say something like ""I've noticed that you have been calling me names, and it hurts my feelings.  I don't think that calling people names is a good way to interact with each other.  I would like to have a respectful relationship with you, and I would appreciate it if you could treat me with respect.""  If this doesn't work, then it may be a good idea to talk to someone about this.  You can talk to a parent, a school counselor, or a trusted adult.  They may be able to help you come up with a plan for how to handle this situation.  If you are in school, you may also want to talk to your teacher or school counselor about this.  They may be able to help you come up with a plan for how to handle this situation.  Remember that you have the right to be treated with respect, and you deserve to be treated with respect.  If you don't feel like you are being treated with respect, then it may be a good idea to talk to someone about this.  You can talk to a parent, a school counselor, or a trusted adult.  They may be able to help you come up with a plan for how to handle this situation.  If you are in school, you may also want to talk to your teacher or school counselor about this.  They may be able to help you come up with a plan for how to handle this situation.  Remember that you have the right to be treated with respect, and you deserve to be treated with respect.  If you don't feel like you are being treated with respect, then it may be a good idea to talk to someone about this.  You can talk to a parent, a school counselor, or a trusted adult.  They may be able to help you come up with a plan for how to handle this situation.  If you are in school, you may also want to talk to your teacher or school counselor about this.  They may be able to help you come up with a plan for how to handle this situation.  Remember that you have the right to be treated with respect, and you deserve to be treated with respect.  If you don't feel like you are being treated with respect, then it may be a good idea to talk to someone about this.  You can talk to a parent, a school counselor, or a trusted adult.  They may be able to help you come up with a plan for how to handle this situation.  If you are in school, you may also want to talk to your teacher or school counselor about this.  They may be able to help you come up with a plan for how to handle this situation.  Remember that you have the right to be treated with respect, and you deserve to be treated with respect.  If you don't feel like you are being treated with respect, then it may be a good idea to talk to someone about this.  You can talk to a parent, a school counselor, or a trusted adult.  They may be able to help you come up with a plan for how to handle this situation.  If you are in school, you may also want to talk to your teacher or school counselor about this.  They may be able to help you come up with a plan for how to handle this situation.  Remember that you have the right to be treated with respect, and you deserve to be treated with respect.  If you don't feel like you are being treated with respect, then it may be a good idea to talk to someone about this.  You can talk to a parent, a school counselor, or a trusted adult.  They may be able to help you come up with a plan for how to handle this situation.  If you are in school, you may also want to talk to your teacher or school counselor about this.  They may be able to help you come up with a plan for how to handle this situation.  Remember that you have the right to be treated with respect, and you deserve to be treated with respect.  If you don't feel like you are being treated with respect, then it may be a good idea to talk to someone about this.  You can talk to a parent, a school counselor, or a trusted adult.  They may be able to help you come up with a plan for how to handle this situation.  If you are in school, you may also want to talk to your teacher",0.555986762046814,4.787796424964266e-79,0.12241054613935969,0.2257251641784957

I believe I have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder. But since it's such a new disorder I can't find any information about it. Could this be what is going on with me?","The world needs more people lately who have such a high degree of empathy which you describe in yourself!If it feels a little burdensome, then look to balance what is too much with its opposite.  Since you're giving a lot of empathy, maybe you'd like receiving a lot of empathy.In the situation you describe, when you start empathizing with others, real or cartoon, ask yourself whether you've felt empathy coming in your direction lately.Often people give to others what they feel within themselves is missing.The emotional brain reasons that if I give you my support, say, then at least I will feel half of what being supported is like.Obviously the wish to receive more empathy cannot be fulfilled by you directly.  Empathy is delivered by someone who is willing to offer it.Reflect on whether you are allowing those who are in your world, to know when you would like to receive their empathy.Is it possible you keep your feelings to yourself and present as though you are able to handle a great deal more than you'd like to handle without anyone's kindness to support you?Being open to others about your own inner thoughts and feelings is much more difficult than it sounds.It sounds easy to just tell someone how you feel.Sometimes the first step is the most difficult, of accessing how you feel.Start with knowing the amount of empathy you'd like from others and what stops you from asking.Also, about your diagnosis and the lack of  studies and lists and formulas.  Each person is unique, the instructions and guidelines don't necessarily mean very much.  Often having a diagnosis makes a person feel weak, stigmatized, incompetent. Forget the diagnosis and concentrate on what you need to do differently in order to feel better.The answers are inside you, not inside a book or website.",I'm not sure if there is a disorder called hyper empathy disorder.

The best way to learn to cope with triggers is to work with a therapist who has experience working with trauma. If you are not able to find a therapist, there are some things you can do on your own to help you cope with triggers. The first step is to be aware of your triggers. You may already be aware of some triggers. If not, you may notice that you have a reaction to something that is not necessarily related to what you are currently doing. For example, you may be feeling anxious when you are driving down the road, but you are not aware of what is causing the anxiety. If you are able to notice that something is triggering you, you may be able to identify what is causing the trigger. It could be something that you see, hear, smell, taste, or touch. Once you are aware of your triggers, you can start to work on coping with them. Some ways of coping with triggers are deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, yoga, and exercise. You can also try to distract yourself with something that you enjoy doing. Another way to cope with triggers is to have a self-soothing box. A self-soothing box is a box that contains items that help you to feel calm and relaxed. You can have anything in your box that you like. You may want to have music, pictures, a stuffed animal, or anything else that helps you to feel calm and relaxed. You can also try to use your senses to help you cope with triggers. You can try to focus on your senses by noticing what you see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. You can also try to use your senses to help you to feel calm and relaxed. For example, you can try to focus on the feeling of your feet on the ground or the feeling of your hands in your lap. You can also try to use your senses to help you to feel calm and relaxed by focusing on your breathing. You can try to focus on your breathing by noticing the rise and fall of your chest or the feeling of your breath in your nose.",0.5045711994171143,2.3968139422753202e-155,0.13487475915221578,0.19677419354838713
How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"To be able to identify a clear ending to a counseling relationship, we must have a clear understanding of the goals and limitations of treatment.  Usually, during the initial evaluation, I identify my client’s short term and long term therapy goals.  As therapy progress, we verify goals on a monthly to a quarterly basis, depending on the frequency of the appointments.  Once the therapy goals have been met, there is a closing session, the counseling relationship is ended, and the client can stop attending sessions.  In some cases, the client can also establish new goals and determine if I am a good fit for their therapy needs or if they need a new provider, in which case I provide multiple referrals.The counseling relationship could also end due to other factors like noncompliance= when a client is not committed to the agreed treatment process, or when the client’s or a counselor violates the counseling relationship.  Either the counselor or the client is able to end counseling.  Although, as mental health providers we need to provide a reason for terminating our therapeutic relationship and referral options, as a client no explanation is needed, a closing session is highly recommended.  ¿Cómo termina la terapia?¿Cómo un consejero decide cuando terminar las sesiones de consejería o terminar de trabajar con un paciente?Para poder determinar el final de la relación del consejero, debemos comprender las metas y parámetros de la terapia.  Usualmente durante la evaluación inicial se identifican metas a corto y largo plazo con el cliente, y se discute con el cliente como esas metas serán alcanzadas.  Durante el proceso de terapia el consejero revisa las metas mensual o trimestralmente dependiendo de la frecuencia de las citas.  Ya que las metas de terapia son alcanzadas, hay una sesión de cierre y el cliente puede terminar la terapia.   En algunos casos el cliente puede identificar nuevas metas para la terapia y determinar si el mismo consejero u otro consejero le pueden asistir. 
La relación de consejería también puede terminar por no conformar o violentar los parámetros  establecidos para la terapia.   Tanto el consejero como el cliente pueden terminar la relación de terapia.  Como proveedores de salud mental los consejeros estamos obligados a proveer un razón para la conclusión del tratamiento y proveer referidos según aplique, los clientes no necesitan proveer una explicación, aunque es recomendable discutirlo en una sesión de cierre.","I think of termination as a process rather than a single session. The process begins at the beginning, as the counselor and client establish goals and a general time frame for working together. Then, as the client makes progress toward goals, the counselor and client can periodically review goals and progress toward them. As the client nears the point of achieving their goals, the counselor and client can begin to decrease the frequency of sessions. For example, if the client was meeting weekly, the counselor and client may decide to meet every other week, then monthly, then every three months. In this way, the client continues to have support and check-in time with the counselor, but the frequency of sessions decreases. When the client feels they have achieved their goals and no longer need counseling, the counselor and client can end counseling.",0.49787282943725586,2.6744291706144167e-79,0.12477718360071302,0.12565401024835096

I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.,"Sometimes we make ourselves feel worse with our own thoughts about things we can't change. We know that it is possible to overcome embarrassment and self-blame, but why does it seem so difficult to overcome it sometimes? If you tune into your own thoughts, or your ""internal dialogue"", you'll notice that your thoughts are connected to your feelings. So people who are holding onto embarrassment and self-blame often have thoughts like, ""How could I do that?"", ""I looked so stupid!"" ""Now people saw things I did not want them to see!"" If we tune in more, we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible, horrible, and that we cannot deal with it. These are self-sabotaging thoughts that lead to shame, self-blame and embarrassment. If you look at the evidence, you can find more rational thoughts such as, "" We all make mistakes"", ""People can look all different ways at different time - this incident does not define me!"" and ""If someone has a bad image or thought about me, it is really OK! People have all kinds of thoughts about other people, and it does not have to be a major problem."" When you practice your rational thoughts often and replace the negative ones, you will start to feel better, more confident and your embarrassment will decrease quickly.","It's hard to know what to say here.  On the one hand, you're in a class and you don't want to embarrass yourself.  On the other, you want to look your best.  I would say that if you're in a class, the main thing is that you're in the class and you're doing your best to participate.  The other students are probably not going to be as focused on what you're wearing as you are.  If you're really concerned, you can try to find a swimsuit that's more conservative or more flattering, but I would encourage you to not focus on it too much.  You're in a class, not a fashion show.  :)",0.4954257607460022,1.698068540707923e-155,0.14450867052023122,0.1374156219864995

"The eight months I've been dating my boyfriend, I have lied about a lot of things. I slept with a couple guys to get back at my boyfriend for breaking up with me. Now anything I say to him he won't believe, even if I'm being honest. I don't know what else to do at this point. He constantly criticizes me.","Start a conversation with him about your sincere interest to earn back his trust.Ask him what he expects from you so that he will trust you again.If you are consciously willing and do try to earn back his trust, and have periodic conversations with him on whether he feels more at ease with trusting you, then after a few months of this, both of you should feel more secure in the relationship.","Hi Nashville, I'm not sure if you're asking what to do with the relationship, or if you're asking how to stop lying and start trusting. Let's look at both. First, I want to say that it's okay to lie to someone if it's to protect yourself. I think you're lying to protect yourself from his criticism, and that's okay. It's also okay to not trust someone who is criticizing you. I think you're protecting yourself from being hurt. But here's the thing: If you want a relationship with someone who you can trust, who you can trust you, and who will treat you with respect, you have to start by doing that with yourself. You have to trust yourself enough to be honest, and you have to respect yourself enough to treat yourself with kindness and honesty. You can't expect others to do that for you if you're not doing it for yourself. The good news is that you already know how to be kind and honest with yourself. You're already doing it, in a way. You know that lying isn't good for you. You know that criticizing yourself isn't good for you. You know that you don't like it when he treats you that way. You know that you want better for yourself. That's a good start. The next step is to start doing that for yourself. Start with little things. If you're going to lie, start by lying to yourself less. Can you tell yourself the truth about the little things? Can you be honest with yourself about your feelings? Can you be kind to yourself when you make a mistake? Can you say ""I'm sorry"" to yourself? Can you be patient with yourself? Can you do small things that you know will make you feel better? And then, when you're ready, can you start doing that with him? Can you tell him the truth about the little things? Can you tell him how you feel? Can you ask him to be kind to you? Can you ask him to listen to you? Can you ask him to respect you? It's a process. Start with the little things. You can do this.",0.5043575763702393,2.773981492227968e-155,0.10434782608695652,0.22388059701492538
"My fiancé doesn't think I trust him because I was cheated on before. However, he hides his phone and has been texting his ex-girlfriend, who he has two kids with. What should I do?","Oh Chino, I only have half the picture here so I will be cautious. There's a chicken and an egg, and I don't know which came first. One thing I see clearly is that your fiance will always have to have communications with his ex, because they have children. Can you accept that? When suspicion and insecurity come along, your job is to look at the big picture and the real picture. Is there any real evidence that he is cheating? Remember that texting his ex is not evidence alone if the communications are about the kids. Has he earned your trust? If so, then it's not fair to punish him for the betrayals of others. He's not your ex. Reassure your heart that you are his priority if the larger evidence supports that. At the same time, you can let him know what your triggers are. For example, hiding his phone doesn't send you a good message, right? See, this is the chicken and the egg...is he hiding the phone because you've been overreacting when he gets a text?  So let him know you won't blow up about him getting a text if he doesn't conceal or password his phone. Transparency helps build trust. You have sensitivities, and it helps you a lot if he's aware of them and willing to try not to do things that trigger fear. Let him know when you get scared, and hopefully he'll give you the openness and security you need in order to trust him and act as if you trust him.  :)","Hi! It sounds like you're feeling a lot of anxiety and insecurity right now, and I'm glad you're reaching out. I think the most important thing to do is to have an open and honest conversation with your fiancé about your feelings and your concerns. I would also suggest having a conversation about your relationship and how you would like to move forward. If you feel that your fiancé is not willing to make any changes, I would encourage you to seek out some individual counseling to work through your feelings and concerns.

Licensed counselors generally completed 4 years of college and an additional 2 years of graduate school. If you are thinking about a career in psychology, the local APA chapter would be a good place to start to find a local psychologist to talk to.

No, he doesn't have the right to penalize you or punish you ...not just for past things...not for anything. What he does get to do it tell you how it affects him.

That's the stuff for you to tune into and focus on right now.","Hi there, I'm glad that you're reaching out for help.  I'm also sorry that you're going through this.  It's hard to be in a relationship where your partner is losing feelings for you.  I'm not sure if you're in a long distance relationship or not.  If you are, it's understandable that you may not see each other as much as you'd like.  But if you're not, I would definitely think about how much you're seeing each other and how that may be impacting the relationship.  You mentioned that he's not really interested in talking about it.  That's a red flag for me.  I would be very concerned about that.  It's important to talk about things in a relationship and if you're partner doesn't want to talk about it, it's a big concern.  I would suggest going to see a local therapist and see if you can get some help with this.  I would also encourage you to do some self reflection about what you're looking for in a relationship and what you want.  If you're not getting that from your current relationship, you may need to consider if this is the relationship for you.  I wish you the best of luck.  Robin J.

"I believe my partner has a masturbation and porn problem. He masturbates daily, even when I am lying in bed sleeping beside him. We have sex once a week. He is rough and worries about his needs. He never touches me, and treats me like a porn star, wanting to finish on my face or chest.","It sounds like your in quite a rough place, my recommendation just based on what you type might warrant a visit to a psychotherapist to resolve what may be going on, I am not entirely sure but it sounds like he might have a bit of a sex addiction problem. One thing you need to ask yourself is ""Am I happy?"", ""Do I feel loved?"", these are deep questions, but the answers to those questions will give you a direction to travel in. ","This is a great question. It sounds like you have a lot of questions and concerns about your partner and your sexual relationship. It's hard to know what's going on without knowing more about both of you. It's also important to note that there is a difference between a sex and porn addiction. It's possible that he has a sex addiction and not a porn addiction, or it could be the other way around. It's also possible that he has both. If you are both willing, I would encourage you to see a sex therapist. It's possible that you both have different sex drives and that's why you have different sex needs. It's also possible that there is an underlying issue that is getting in the way of your sexual connection.

How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,This is a tough decision to make for anyone that has ever been involved in a relationship.  My advice is for you to consider what is making you unhappy in this relationship.  Sometimes we think we are ready to move on but don't know the reason why and then we regret it.  The worst thing you want after the fact is to have regret.  Take time to do some soul searching and imagine your life without this person before you make any decisions.  This will also help you understand what it is you are looking for in a romantic relationship. Best of luck in your love life. Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling,"I'm not sure whether you're referring to a short term relationship or a long term relationship.  I'll give you my perspective on long term relationships, but the same ideas can be applied to shorter relationships as well.  First of all, I think it's important to look at the reasons for wanting to end the relationship.  Are you unhappy?  Is there a specific reason for your unhappiness?  Are you being treated poorly?  Is there a lack of respect?  Is there a lack of communication?  Are you unhappy with the way you are being treated?  Is there a lack of intimacy?  These are just a few examples, but I hope you get the idea.  If there is a specific reason for your unhappiness, you can try to work on it with your partner.  Communication is key.  If you can communicate your needs and wants, and if you can listen to your partner's needs and wants, then you can try to work on finding a solution.  If you're both willing to work on it and you both have the same goal of making the relationship work, then it's worth trying to make it work.  If one of you is not willing to work on it, then it may be time to move on.  However, if you're not sure of the reason for your unhappiness, or if you can't seem to work out the issues, then it may be time to move on.  I think it's important to make sure that you are both on the same page and both want to work on the relationship.  If you are both willing to work on it and you are both committed to the relationship, then it's worth trying to make it work.  If you're both not willing to work on it, or if you're not both committed to the relationship, then it may be time to move on.  I hope this helps.  Take care.",0.5301435589790344,7.289233833441816e-79,0.1393258426966292,0.2618697478991597
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","The short answer is: absolutely not! The longer answer is that it might take some time to process all of the issues, and it may feel quite ""muddy"" in the issues for a lot longer than is tolerable (which is why counseling may have been postponed to begin with for you.) It's important to be realistic when entering counseling of any sort, and that the therapist be realistic with you about what you might be able to expect working with that person (I use the words ""might be able to expect"" because therapy experiences can vary.) But that not having counseling about trauma that you have experienced much earlier in your life can play a significant role in the process and how long that process could take to unpack all that may have been buried over time.It might also be helpful in counseling to work with the therapist on figuring out where to begin, but to also manage the feelings of being overwhelmed that may make it hard to continue to show up and do the work required, week in and week out. It isn't easy work trying to process past pain that you experienced, and so consistent practice of self-care, including leaning on support systems outside of therapy, is key.","No, you do not have too many issues for counseling.  In fact, many people who seek counseling have multiple issues they would like to work on.  A good therapist will help you prioritize your concerns and work on the ones that are most important to you.  It's also important to remember that many of the issues you mention are related.  For example, sexual abuse can lead to depression, anxiety, and sleep issues.  By working on one issue, you may see improvements in some of the others as well.  I would encourage you to seek out counseling to help you with the many issues you are facing.",0.542517364025116,6.121240230416585e-79,0.15527950310559005,0.14962593516209477
"I have PTSD. The side effects are really bad and have impacts on sex, anger and my relationships. I even lost my job month ago.    How can I get my life back?","Slowly is the rate at which you'll get back your life.Being traumatized means not feeling safe in almost all areas of life.Be patient with yourself as you try to regain trust that people will not harm you and will be sources of satisfaction in your life.It is possible that the trauma in your life requires such great attention on your part to your own inner emotional safety that you are better off with a less intensive job than the one you recently lost.Try to prioritize restoring your emotional and psychological health.  With this as the top area of your attention then you may have an easier time to accept a lesser degree of involvement in your work and relationships.When you feel angry, try to examine if underlying the anger are feelings of stress, fear, insecurity regarding your position in relationship to the person toward whom you feel angry.   Anger is often the surface reaction to more destabilizing emotions like fear and insecurity.Gradually by nurturing and comforting yourself, living at a pace which is uniquely comfortable to what and how much you can handle, you'll regain your trust in both yourself and relating to others.","You are in a very common place and there is hope.  You can get your life back.  I have seen it happen many times.  It is a process, but it is possible.  If you have PTSD, it is a sign that

I read that you should ignore them and they have to come to a conclusion that they were wrong on their own terms.

Please help me. I need your advice.","Hello. It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight, and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage. I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now. Marriages take lots of work, and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young - good, bad, or indifferent. There are no easy answers to your questions, and I won't presume that my response to you will be the linch-pin that heals all your pain. But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. No one is perfect. We fail more often than we succeed, but in the end we learn, and that learning helps us grow. Yes, you're right, the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good, and need to stop. You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard, and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. Seeing a therapist for yourself, and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. You have issues that you need to resolve, that, while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life, they are separate from your marriage in many respects.Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. You can find these through local counseling resources. Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. If you belong to a religious or spiritual community, then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed, so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you.Lastly, parents are imperfect. Yep...its true. They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. We limp along and do our best. Having said that, we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future, no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid, and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. Both with ourselves, and toward other people. So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit.  I am sure that remains to be seen, but either way you both must be involved in saving it. If only one of you cares, then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. That's not fair. So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants, and work to create an amicable solution. All of this said, seek out supportive friends, and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life. One way or the other, you will benefit from it.Be well.","I'm so sorry to hear of your suffering. It sounds like you have a lot of pain that you are carrying around.

I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"The best way to move on is to give yourself sufficient time and space away from your ex so you can heal.  That means no checking out your ex on social media platforms and no contact.  In order to move on and diminish the obsessions, help yourself recognize and accept that the relationship is over, and make sure to get sufficient support in processing all your feelings.  Once that takes place, it can be useful to explore and process with a professional the meaning of the relationship and to understand your part in what transpired.Sometimes people obsess because they have difficulties accepting what's already taken place and want things to be different.  The key to moving forward is to be loving toward yourself, to give yourself permission to grieve the loss, and to start cultivating new and healthy habits/patterns.  Reengage in your present life, ask yourself what you want your life to look like, and start creating goals and taking small steps to create the amazing life you want for yourself.","The best way to move on from a breakup is to accept the fact that it happened.  I know that may sound simple, but it can be very difficult to accept.  One way to help you accept that it's over is to actually say out loud that you accept that it's over.  Also, try to make a new beginning with yourself.  Maybe get a new haircut, or buy a new outfit, or do something that makes you feel good and new.  I hope this helps.  Best of luck to you.",0.5727101564407349,0.039384451003162346,0.20300751879699247,0.16394516063024353
How does a person start the counseling process?,The first thing to do is to reflect on what you want to seek counseling. Search online and then set up a phone consultation. A person can find out a lot about a counselor and the services that they offer over the phone. After a consultation then set up an intake questions. The overall goal is to make sure that you are comfortable with the counselor and the services they can offer.,"Hi there!  Thank you for your question.  Beginning the counseling process can seem daunting, but it is actually very easy.  The first step is to decide what you are looking for in a counselor.  Are you looking for someone who specializes in a particular area (for example, depression, anxiety, trauma, etc.)?  Do you have a specific location in mind?  Do you have a preference for the gender of your counselor?  Once you have decided what you are looking for, you can begin your search.  There are many websites that allow you to search for counselors based on your criteria.  My favorite is called Psychology Today (https://www.psychologytoday.com).  Once you find a counselor that you would like to work with, the next step is to call and schedule an appointment.  Many counselors offer a free phone consultation, which can be a great way to ask questions and determine if the counselor is a good fit for you.  Once you have scheduled an appointment, the counselor will likely ask you to fill out some paperwork before your first session.  Then, you are all set!  It really is that easy!  I hope this was helpful.  Best of luck to you!  :)",0.562121570110321,4.740953511676552e-155,0.16236162361623616,0.29620853080568726

I can't imagine how difficult it must be for you to see her go through this. I'm not sure how much you know about depression, but it's important to know that it's a very serious illness. It's not just ""feeling sad"". Depression can be very debilitating and can interfere with daily activities. Depression is caused by a combination of factors, such as genetics, stress, trauma, and even life transitions. It's important to know that depression is very common and can affect anyone. It's also treatable. The best thing you can do for your girlfriend is to support her in getting the help she needs. I would suggest that you talk to her about seeing a therapist. If she's not ready for that, I would suggest that you find a therapist yourself and learn more about depression. There are also some great books about depression that you can read to learn more. One that I would recommend is ""Lost Connections"" by Johann Hari. If your girlfriend is open to it, I would suggest that you attend therapy with her. It can be very helpful to have the support of loved ones during treatment. If you are not able to attend therapy with her, it's important to remember that you are not responsible for her recovery.

"I'm feeling rejected and frustrated. This is not new. The first month we were together, sex was about every day. Then it slowed down to once a month right away. I love my husband, but I am struggling with this.","   Feeling rejected and frustrated is a reasonable reaction to your experience with your husband. I want to encourage you that his actions may have little to do with you, and regardless of outcomes, I hope you find the help you need to process through your pain and still have hope for your marriage.   If your husband was to work with me I'd explore with him his understanding of, and experience with, intimacy in relationship with others. Furthermore, like other male clients of mine, I'd challenge your husband to secure an updated full medical exam from his PCP (primary care physician) and/or urologist in order to identify or rule out any organic issues which may be causing his apparent lack of desire for sexual intimacy. If there are no physical issues, per se, I would encourage your husband to process further his family of origin story-line regarding rules, roles, sex, and sexuality along with working through his sexual and trauma histories. ","Hi! I'm glad you're reaching out! I'm so sorry you're struggling with this. I'm not surprised you're feeling rejected and frustrated, because I think anyone would feel that way in this situation. There are many possible reasons for low sexual desire in a partner, and it's hard to say from here what's going on. I would encourage you to have a conversation with your husband about this, and see if you can get some insight into what's going on for him. If you can't, or if you feel like you're not getting the information you need, I would encourage you both to seek out a qualified sex therapist.

"My daughter didn't see her biological father for the last three years. She doesn’t want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse. The visitation is with supervision, but she refuses to see him. Is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy?","Hi Dillon,I'm from Canada, so I don't know the laws in your state. It depends on that a good deal, perhaps. In my opinion, a child should never be forced into a situation where they feel unsafe, even if it is ""supervised"". If the child is old enough to make a strong statement about not wanting to see a parent, then this should be honoured. Unfortunately, the laws don't always uphold a parent's right to do what is best for their child. I recommend you see a lawyer, who will advise you about how to proceed without putting yourself at risk of breaching custody agreements.If you feel your daughter can benefit from therapy, that is a separate question. Or is she already in therapy? A family therapist will typically meet with you alone first, in order to determine if therapy is a wise move for your child. It isn't always appropriate.","This is a very difficult situation for everyone involved.  Your daughter has been through a lot and it is important to honor her feelings.  I would recommend seeing a therapist who specializes in working with children and trauma.  The therapist can help your daughter process her feelings about her father and the situation.  The therapist can also help your daughter develop healthy coping skills for managing her feelings.  As far as seeing her father, I would recommend that the therapist be involved in this process.  I would not recommend forcing your daughter to see her father, but it is important to respect the legal process.  The therapist can help you and your daughter make the best decisions for her.",0.571048378944397,3.739296187010894e-155,0.1371841155234657,0.17787394521689023

"My parents seem okay with other sexualities, but normally they only talk about being gay. When they do talk about bisexuality, they say things like “they'll do anything” or things that make me very uncomfortable because I am bisexual. I don't know if I am ready to come out to them.","Perhaps you are not ready to come out to your parents.  Often times our readiness is not dependent on what others' will say or how they react. But more so dependent on how emotionally prepared we are to deal with others' reactions.  It may be beneficial for you to play out each possible scenario and conclusion (eg. your parents being supportive vs. your parents being disappointed and so on).

If you don't feel ready to talk to them about your sexuality, maybe you can talk to them about how you feel about their comments about bisexuality. If you feel safe enough to talk to them, you could also tell them that you are bisexual. You can tell them that you are still exploring your sexuality and you don't know if you are bisexual, but that you know that you are attracted to both genders.

"I've been going through a rough time lately. I been into nothing but women. I’ve never thought about men until a week ago. I’m very upset and depressed about this. It's not normal to me. I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that I’m not gay. I get the same results each time, and I feel disgust. This is tough on me. I'm scared that I looked too many times. I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.","Hello. Coming to terms with the idea that you might be of a sexuality other than the one in which you were socially raised to be, can be emotionally disturbing, and quite unsettling. It creates anxiety, maybe even panic, and leaves us feeling confused and uncertain about our own sense of identity. It becomes important to first ask yourself how you feel when you are thinking of being intimate with guys, or if you desire them to be intimate with you. It is important to know what impact this has on you, because it can determine your level of follow through and desire in pursuing sexual activity with someone of the same sex. I am not going to pass judgment on you either way - even for having the thoughts. I have worked with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) community in various ways over the years. Many I speak to, say they had to struggle to come to terms with this awareness about how they see themselves sexually. Maybe you are bisexual, and don't have an exclusive attraction to the same sex. You might consider doing some searches online for community support groups in your area, to explore the feelings and issues around this topic. Talking to someone who you trust can be helpful too. Running from your feelings is not a good idea, and others in a support group for sexuality issues, might be able to relate to you and what you're going through right now. This will offer you perspective, as you think on how this plays out in your life.Counselors are typically well trained to provide clinical services to clients who are experiencing feelings and thoughts much like the ones you are having now. I encourage you to consider reaching out for help. You are not crazy or insane for thinking of working with a counselor, nor of having feelings of same sex attraction. If you decide you are indeed gay, then know that you are not alone and never will be alone in that feeling. There is a huge community of support for you. Additionally, we all need help sometimes dealing with all sort of issues. A counselor can work more in depth with you to examine the motivations behind the feelings, and help you come to terms with them more directly. I hope that you come to a place where you feel less alone and more secure with yourself as you examine this area of your life. No matter what, do not fear being yourself. Again...you are not alone, I promise.Warm regards,Shawn Berthel, M.S., LMHC","Hi! I'm so glad you wrote. You're not alone in feeling confused about your sexuality. This is something that many people struggle with and it's actually a very normal thing. There are many people who are attracted to both men and women. There are also people who are attracted to one gender when they are young and then later in life realize they are attracted to the other gender. I encourage you to take some time to explore your feelings and thoughts about your sexuality. It's important to accept and embrace who you are and to live the life that you want. You can't control who you are attracted to, but you can control how you react to your feelings. If you are struggling to accept yourself and your sexuality, I encourage you to seek out a therapist who is trained in helping people work through these issues.

"I have known her for years. She was dating my brother-in-law when we met. My kids think of her as their aunt. On Halloween 2014, I lost my mom to cancer. My mom and dad were still married when she passed away. My friend was there for me through that and my own cancer diagnosis. She has been a very big part of both me and my kids’ life, but now last month, my dad told me that he really likes my friend and wants to marry her. She’s like a sister to me. My kids hate the idea.","How are you measuring whether or not your dad understands your wish?Your dad understanding your wish does not mean he will necessarily follow through with what you want.Based on what you describe about your relationship to the woman in question, your discomfort with the idea of your dad marrying your friend, is reasonable.Have the conversation with your dad that includes your viewpoint, and also ask him for his impression of your feelings.Its even possible he already has considered your feelings and hasn't yet told you.It is also possible that a conversation on the subject, as well as your dad following through with his decision to marry your best friend, may develop in a very positive way.Part of the current uneasiness you feel may be from fear of how a change in circumstances and introducing new relationship dynamics might feel.Given that the person who died was your mom, maybe your emotions are not yet ready seeing your dad with a replacement spouse. Try to see the situation from the point of everyone, including yourself, who is involved in this major change.  Maybe having a family discussion about acceptance and readiness to accept a new partner for your dad, would open new empathy for all of these family members.","It's very common for people to have a close relationship with someone who is not a blood relative.  In fact, it's often the case that the relationships we have with people who are not our relatives are more important than the relationships we have with our relatives.  So I'm not surprised that you feel close to your friend and that she is a very important person in your life.  The same is true for your kids.  I'm sure they feel close to her and that she's like a sister to them.  It's also normal to have mixed emotions about a parent marrying someone who is close to you.  I can imagine that you are feeling a lot of different emotions right now, some of which may be confusing and even conflicting.  It's also possible that your friend is feeling a lot of mixed emotions as well.  I would suggest talking to her about what you are feeling and how you are feeling.  It's also possible that she would like to talk to your dad about this.  It's important that you and your friend have a chance to express your feelings about this.  I would also suggest that you talk to your kids about their feelings and concerns.  It's important that they feel heard and that their feelings are respected.  It's also possible that you and your dad would like to talk about this.  It's important that you are able to express your feelings and concerns to your dad.  This is a big change for your family and it's important that everyone has a chance to express their feelings.  It's also possible that you may need some help to work through this, in which case a therapist may be able to help.",0.58809894323349,1.5805306633946982e-78,0.1692307692307692,0.25380943874675616

"I just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. My family and I really need this job.
   People keep telling me I have ""anxiety"" and I'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. This is all new to me. What can I do?","Hi, It is really good that you are working so hard to take care of your family. Anxiety can be so challenging, especially when new challenges have come up. It would be good to work through some of these issues you are experiencing, and examine your self care and support processes.","Hi, It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the new job and the travel that it requires. You're not alone - lots of people feel this way when they take on a new role, especially if it requires them to travel far away from home and family. It's important to remember that anxiety is actually a natural response that we all have, and it's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it's actually a great thing when it helps us to be prepared for a new challenge. When we're feeling anxious, our bodies are preparing us for action. So, if we're anxious about a new job, our body is preparing us to take on that new challenge. I think that the key here is to learn how to manage your anxiety so that it doesn't interfere with your ability to do your job. There are a lot of different strategies that you can use to do this. One of the things that you can do is to make sure that you're getting enough sleep and exercise. These are two things that can really help to reduce your anxiety. Another thing that you can do is to practice some relaxation techniques. There are lots of different ones out there, but some that you might want to try are deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and meditation. There are lots of resources out there that can help you to learn these techniques. You can also try to practice some mindfulness. This is basically just being present in the moment and not worrying about the future or dwelling on the past. You can also try to challenge your anxious thoughts. When you notice that you're having an anxious thought, try to reframe it in a more positive way. For example, instead of thinking ""I can't do this job"", you could think ""I can do this job, and I'm going to be okay"". You can also try to use positive self-talk. This is basically just talking to yourself in a positive way. For example, you could say ""I've got this"" or ""I can do this"". Another thing that you can try is to use some visualization techniques. This is basically just imagining yourself doing well in your new job. You can also try to use some distraction techniques. This is basically just doing something that you enjoy to distract yourself from your anxiety. For example, you could listen to music or read a book. I hope that some of these strategies are helpful for you. I would also encourage you to seek out some professional help if you feel like your anxiety is really interfering with your ability to do your job. A therapist can help you to develop some strategies that are specific to you and your situation.",0.532128095626831,4.2599345366445525e-79,0.0981132075471698,0.2616163424434102
"I'm in my late teens and live with my dad.  The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I won't want to talk to them for days or even weeks. 

Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.

Are they right, am I depressed?","Hello. Being a teenager in our society today can cause depression quite easily. We look at the world in which we live, and the doubts we have about being able to make a contribution, or to have value and worth with the people around us, and we begin to internalize those messages of self-worth. If that alone were not enough, you are trying to figure out where you want to go in life, and who you are supposed to be in the world. Teens are faced with pressures of being judged by your peers for how you present yourself; following current fashions; possessing the trendy things; and hanging out with the ""in crowd."" Here's a ""secret"" that might help with most of those issues: Not much of those problems I've just described will really matter as they might seem to right now, in the real world. If you are feeling depression because you feel you lack some of those things that are seen as important by others (like your peers), I can assure you that being someone who is kind; compassionate; understanding of another person's suffering; and the effort you make to be the best person you can become in the world, will far outweigh anything you experienced in your teen years.When we are young, we judge everything based on what our peers have, what they say, the way they dress, who's popular, who's not popular, and for the most of it, all of that is external. So the question becomes, are you trying to fix the feelings on the inside (the internal stuff), with the trappings of all the stuff on the outside (the internal)? That is to say, do you feel that if you had what your friends have, you would be happy and less depressed? Depression is usually a symptom of something much bigger, it is not typically a problem by itself (just as a person who experiences a high temperature may likely have a cold). So fixing the symptom requires looking at the possible causes. In your post, you mentioned that you live with your dad. Are your parents divorced or separated, or has your mom passed away? Either of these circumstances could certainly cause depression. Finding out when you started feeling depressed, might be able to pinpoint the trigger that caused it, which requires looking at when you last felt really happy. It is also important to keep in mind, that as a teenager, your emotions are often being experienced very randomly, and sometimes without cause. It is part of your emotional development, but as you grow older can learn how to manage those emotions better and practice doing things that help you feel better (without causing harm to yourself).Have you tried talking to your dad about your feelings, or maybe another relative if you feel safer doing so? Do you have a friend who is your best friend...someone who is there for you no matter what? If not, there is a service you can use that is a national number for teens to talk with teen peer counselors. They are teens like yourself, but they have some insights that might be helpful. Its called Teen Line (https://teenlineonline.org/). It helped me when I was in my teens, and has helped lots of other teens as well. You might find a place to get some referrals to other local services in your area. If you want are in Washington state and would like to connect with me directly, you call link to me via my profile page. Or perhaps finding a counselor in your local area might be useful. Most towns and cities have some form of low cost counseling. You might also check with your school for assistance.Don't be afraid of not always knowing how you are supposed to feel. Adults don't always have a handle on it either. Being a teenager carries a lot stress, fear, and uncertainty. But you are not alone, and there is help if you reach out for it. I wish for you the very best, and bright future. ","It sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression.

I’m facing severe depression and anxiety and I just feel like I’m going through a lot. This really distracts me and I cant get my mind off the things that are bothering me.    How do I overcome this anxierty and depression?,Anxiety and depression are often linked. I don't consider them as diseases. Depression is a symptom of deep hurts to the sense of self that leaves a person feeling shamed. Anxiety is a symptom of not being given the proper emotional resources to handle the problems of life. It is also the result of being taught that life is a dangerous place that can't be managed.,"The short answer is that you can't. Depression and anxiety are medical conditions. They are not something that you can just ""overcome"". They are serious and need to be treated by a professional.

"My husband and I have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. Others have told me that most men would have left me by now. Honestly, I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing. I want to be better connected with my husband.","It's encouraging that you say you want ""to be better connected with [your] husband,"" and since he hasn't left you, he must care about you and the relationship more than he does about just having sex. You don't say whether he complains or not, but even if he doesn't it seems there's a sense of something important missing for both of you.Most likely to connect better with him physically you'll need to become better connected with yourself and your body. Men often feel fulfilled by sex simply because it happened - the woman they want received them, allowed them to make love with her. For women that can sometimes be more complicated. A woman who loves sex most likely also loves her body, knows what pleasures her, and feels confident asking for what she wants. Self-pleasuring can be a way for you to discover more about your sexuality, and a classic resource is Betty Dodson's book Sex for One: The Joy of Selfloving. A good counselor or sex therapist can be very helpful with your whole relationship as well as the sexual part of it, but not all counselors are comfortable working with sexual issues. Shop around and be sure you find someone who can help you and your husband get better connected on all levels.",I would suggest that you both have a conversation about what is going on with your sex drive and what you both would like to change.  It may be helpful to talk with a local therapist who specializes in working with couples to help you both to talk about your concerns and to learn new skills to help you to connect more intimately.,0.5186595916748047,6.79364162019322e-156,0.15331010452961671,0.1174260335473899
"I'm a teenager and I get these really intense mood swings.    My mood will be really high and I'll think of something that I want to do.

Sometimes, we get tied to one thing we really want to do and it can feel pretty intense when that gets interrupted or doesn't work out. This said, you're coming to CounselChat and so I'm guessing this is something that is pretty intense for you and something that you are concerned about. If this is getting in the way of your life, it may be worthwhile to reach out to a therapist or doctor to get some help with this and see if there might be something more going on. While for most people frustration/mood swings is related to typical life and stress, if very intense it can be a sign of a number of challenges ranging from anxiety to a traumatic experience to something like Bipolar Disorder where a person's mood and energy might fly so high (mania) that one feels like they can do anything but often become frustrated when interrupted (note: there is a lot more to Bipolar Disorder than this and this is certainly not a diagnosis).

It's really hard to accept yourself when you don't like what you see. But, I also know that when you don't like yourself, it's because you're seeing a distorted reflection. We all have that, and it's hard to get rid of. You can, though. Here's how:1. You have to accept that you're not going to like yourself 100% of the time. It's okay to have those moments when you don't like yourself.2. When you start to have those moments, try to catch yourself and reframe it. For example, ""I'm feeling really down right now, but I know that this will pass.""3. When you're feeling down, ask for help. You can't change your reflection all at once. You need help to change it. Ask your girlfriend, friends, or family to help you change it.4. When you're feeling good, remind yourself that you're worth it and that you're not annoying.5. Practice self-compassion. I like to use the example of a child. If your child fell down, you wouldn't say ""you're so stupid!"" You would say ""it's okay, honey. Let me help you up."" That's how you should treat yourself.

"I was never single, afraid to be alone, and I looked for my boyfriend to make me happy. I finally worked on my self, was in a relationship, and I did everything a healthy girlfriend does and it didn't work out. Now months later, no man peaks my interest. Am I ready to date again? Is there a reason no one sparks my interest?","Yes, of course there's a reason!There's always a reason for most dynamics!Depending on the nature and qualities of what changed as a result of your new self realizations, you may be more deeply affected by your new awareness than how you imagined these would go.Since you already are on the best road possible for yourself, since this resulted from your own introspection, keep trusting your own self work as to what develops and at what pace your relationship attraction qualities grow.","I think you're in a great place to be right now.  You have a great understanding of what you want in a relationship and what you need in order to be happy.  You know that you need to be happy on your own in order to be happy in a relationship.  I don't know why no one sparks your interest.  It's hard to say.  I would just say to be patient with yourself.  You don't have to rush into anything.  Just be true to yourself and you will be happy.  I would also suggest that you work on yourself in other ways.  Get to know yourself and what you want out of life and out of a relationship.  The more you do this, the more you will be able to recognize it when it comes along.  I would also suggest that you try not to pressure yourself to be in a relationship.  It's okay to be single and it's okay to be happy on your own.  It's okay to not be in a relationship.  Just be true to yourself.",0.4990406036376953,3.438860706278397e-155,0.13970588235294118,0.19222041058645373
"When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. She is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but I am afraid she is stressing too much.

I start hysterically crying and freaking out when my boyfriend obviously has done nothing to hurt me.","Have you sought the support of a therapist really qualified in working through sexual trauma?

The symptoms you describe are typical of someone who has experienced a traumatic event. It sounds like you may have been sexually assaulted or raped. If so, you are not alone. One in four women will be sexually assaulted or raped in her lifetime. It is very common for people who have been sexually assaulted or raped to experience PTSD. I would encourage you to seek out a counselor who specializes in treating trauma. There are treatments that are very effective for trauma. However, it is important that you have someone who specializes in trauma treatment. If you do not know of a counselor who specializes in trauma, you can contact your local mental health association.

"I've hit my head on walls and floors ever since I was young. I sometimes still do it but I don't exactly know why,    I have anxiety and I had a rough childhood but now I'll start to hit my head and sometimes not realize it but I don't know how to stop or even why I'm doing it.    How can I help myself to change my behavior?","The best way to handle anxiety of this level is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor, and therapy to help you understand the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are causing the anxiety. This is not something that anyone should just “white knuckle” and try to get through on their own with no help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety. This takes a therapist trained in CBT. You will learn to recognize when and why you perform the behavior of hitting your head, help you deal with the underlying cause of this, and replace the behavior with a more positive behavior. You'll learn coping skills.You mention having a rough childhood. Anyone who has experienced trauma like this, especially long-term ongoing trauma from abuse of any kind, definitely does not need ""exposure therapy"", which is what is recommended for phobias. You need a therapist trained specifically in trauma informed therapy.You are on the right path by recognizing there is an issue and what it is. Good luck with your healing journey!","This is a great question. There are many different reasons why a person would hit their head, and it's hard to know the exact reason without knowing a lot more about you and your history. However, it's great that you're already aware of the behavior and want to change it. I would suggest talking with a therapist who can help you figure out the function of the behavior (why you're doing it) and then you can come up with some alternative behaviors that serve the same purpose. For example, if you are hitting your head when you are anxious, maybe you could find another way to cope with anxiety that is less harmful, like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation. If you are hitting your head when you are frustrated, maybe you could find another way to cope with frustration, like taking a break and going to a quiet place. I would also suggest talking with your primary care physician and/or a neurologist to rule out any medical issues that may be contributing to this behavior.",0.574312686920166,1.2718939668082114e-78,0.17297297297297295,0.2583266582258856
"My husband and I had our first threesome recently. Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me.    He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better, and now I'm craving more of it. But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling. Why am I feeling this way?","You need to have an honest conversation with each other about WHY you both want a threesome. Evaluate the status of your relationship with each other. Are you having issues? Fighting? Not feeling satisfied with each other? How has your sex life been with each other?  If there are any problems, insecurities, issues, introducing something like this may only make your relationship worse. Open relationships and threesomes rarely work out well. Sure, there are some who successfully live this lifestyle, but it only works when both people are completely secure in their relationship with each other, harbor no jealousies or insecurities, and aren't looking to someone else to satisfy needs that aren't getting met by their spouse. Let me say that again: This is not likely to work out well for you if either of you are insecure, jealous, or looking to have needs met by this other person that you aren't getting from your spouse. That empty feeling you're having - listen to it. Dig deep to find out where it is coming from. What thoughts are going through your head when you feel that way? You'll get the answer.The other thing that helps make something like this work is for both of you to listen and respect each other. If you don't like it that he paid more attention to the other girl, he needs to know that, and he needs to respect that.  If you're going to do it again, he needs to know what you're comfortable with and what you want. Set the limits before you're in the moment, before it's too late to take an action back. Turn it around and ask him what he would be comfortable with if it were a man instead of a woman.It is perfectly natural to be curious and want to experiment. A lot of people get that out of the way before settling down in a monogamous relationship. People who marry young and/or inexperienced may still feel that curiosity about things like that and want to experience them, but don't want to hurt their spouse. The REASON you are both doing this matters a lot. If there are problems in your relationship, this is likely to only make things worse.","Hi there, I'm so glad you asked this question. I have had a number of clients come to me with similar concerns. It's so important to be able to talk about it. I think it's great that you and your husband are talking about your experiences. This is so important. You said that ""it made me feel better"" but you still have this empty feeling. I wonder if you can tell me a little bit more about this empty feeling. I wonder what it is that you are craving more of. I would encourage you to explore this with your husband. What is it that you are craving? Is it the threesome itself or is it the feeling that you get during the threesome? I would also encourage you to explore this feeling. What does it feel like? Where do you feel it in your body? Where does it start? Where does it end? Is it a particular colour? What is it telling you? I would also encourage you to explore what is underneath this feeling. What is it that you are afraid of? What is it that you are worried about? What is the worst thing that could happen? What is the best thing that could happen? What is the most realistic thing that could happen? You may find that this feeling is just a feeling and it doesn't mean anything. It may just be a feeling. It may just be your body's way of telling you that it's not ready for another threesome. Or it may be telling you that you need to talk to your husband about something. I hope this was helpful. I would love to hear how you go.",0.5471811294555664,4.007399995430456e-155,0.1748148148148148,0.20200612984118138
"I'm in my mid 20s with a husband and children. I love my family, but I feel like I've lost my identity, and I don't know who I am other than a mom and wife. At times, all I can think is what I gave up and how I feel unhappy and trapped, but I know I'd feel like worse without them. I loathe myself at times. I have an amazing life, so why can't I just enjoy it?","It is not easy being a wife and mother. You have shifted roles in your life. You went from having a career to focusing on your family. Transitioning can be hard, especially when we feel we gave something up that we really wanted. I want to acknowledge you for wanting to be the best wife and mother you can. I think it is great that you are self-aware and want to work on this.Feeling ""unhappy and trapped"" may also mean that you are  believing these negative thoughts are absolutely true. We have lots and lots of thoughts throughout the day. Sometimes we pay a lot of attention to some and some we ignore. Right now these thoughts are getting a lot of your attention and perhaps you are thinking because you are thinking them they are true.  Is it really true that you trapped? You also said that you have an amazing life. It doesn't sound like you are only having negative thoughts. You have some positive ones, too. However, you are giving a lot of weight to the negative thoughts, more weight than the positive ones.I also wonder if you are struggling with the fact that you are even having this thought. One thing that can be helpful is to recognize that you are having a thought, that it is a negative thought, that thinking it does not make it true, and to let it go. This is the basis for mindfulness work that can be really helpful. It is a great place for you to start so you can balance out your thoughts and emotions.Best of luck to you!","Hi Louisiana, You're not alone in this feeling. I've heard it from so many women, and some men too. I call it the ""Mommy Identity Crisis"". It's a time when you're feeling a bit lost and you can't remember who you were before you became a parent. It's actually a natural part of the parenting journey. You're not broken. You're not a bad mom. You just need a bit of help getting reacquainted with yourself. The first step is to accept that this is a natural part of the journey. The second step is to give yourself permission to be a ""good enough"" mom. We can't be perfect. We can't be everything to everyone. We can't be the best mom 100% of the time. We can't be the perfect wife, employee, daughter, friend, and sister. That's a lot of pressure. The third step is to give yourself time to be with yourself. This is where you start to reconnect with your identity. What do you love? What are your interests? What do you want to do? What makes you happy? What do you miss? The fourth step is to schedule in time to do these things. If you don't schedule it in, it won't happen. If you need to, you can ask for help from your partner or family. You can hire someone to help out with the housework or to watch the kids for a few hours. It's okay to ask for help. It's okay to take care of yourself. The fifth step is to find a mom tribe. There are lots of moms out there who are going through the same thing. Find a group that shares your interests and values. This is where you can find support and encouragement. The sixth step is to be patient with yourself. You won't find yourself overnight. It takes time. It takes practice. It takes effort. But it's worth it. You'll be a better mom and wife when you're happy and fulfilled. The seventh step is to remember that it's okay to be a work in progress. You don't have to have it all figured out. You don't have to be perfect. You just have to keep trying. Keep moving forward. Keep growing. Keep learning. Keep loving. Keep being. You're doing great. Keep up the good work.",0.5787102580070496,1.1035541366415907e-78,0.165938864628821,0.2572746628814762
I am going through a very hard time and I'm so depressed. My parents are getting a divorce and a lot of bad things are happening. I want to lull myself.,"It sounds like a tough time and it's normal to feel down when your family is going through a divorce or other hardship. There's a difference between feelings like sadness, discouragement, grief, loneliness and depression, though. Sadness is sadness and sometimes we have to go through a grieving or other process, that is a normal reaction to events in our lives. Depression, on the other hand, is more about being stuck. Lulling yourself with self-care sounds like a healthy response and a way to give yourself support. So as to the uncomfortable but healthy part of your feelings, do the best you can to put names to it and share with a trusted other person. You will find comfort. The part of your situation that's depression -- feeling stuck, not able to get out of bad, concentrate, changes in sleeping and eating, loss of enjoyment in living, poor hygiene, feelings of hopelessness, that's different. First step, identify your own symptoms of depression. If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself, tell someone. If you're not sure, you can try 800-lifenet or other support line to get feedback. First aid for depression includes: daily care and feeding, good sleeping and eating, lots of exercise--even when you don't feel like it-- healthy socializing, and focusing on talking to yourself in a positive way. If you aren't able to move yourself out of your depression,  work with a professional to make short-term goals and get some support. You may also talk to your doctor or psychiatrist about trying an anti-depressant to give you a little lift while you go through a rough patch.Best wishes,Karen","I'm so sorry you're going through this.

"I've got so much anger. I don't know how to control myself. My girlfriend screams at me all the time, and sometime I don't know how to deal with life. I'm very depressed and angry. I feel lost.","Hi Campbell River, You say you have anger but you don't mention how it shows. Or maybe it doesn't. Are you aggressive with your girlfriend? Since you mention depression, I wonder if you're bottling it all up somewhere instead of letting it show at all. If this is the case, I admire your ability to not lash out at someone who's hurting you. However, if they are totally  unexpressed, anger turn inward and shift into depression. When she yells at you, what do you do? Is this the moment that you feel the most angry? I wouldn't be surprised; anger is a normal response to someone yelling at you. Something about anger...it's often there to cover up our more vulnerable emotions. Under the anger I wonder if you feel worthless, powerless, scared, unloved. Part of the trick to reducing anger is identifying those other emotions and expressing them. You say you don't know how to deal with life, and I think maybe you mean you don't know how to deal with emotions. Lots of people don't! This is confusing for most of us. What am I feeling? Why is it so strong? I'm afraid to express it for fear of hurting someone (or falling apart, or feeling alone...). How do I know what to express and what to be quiet about? These are all great questions to ask yourself, and a qualified therapist can help you sort it all out and support you in your growth. I wish you well!","It sounds like you have a lot going on right now.  It can be difficult to handle anger and depression on your own, and it sounds like you are struggling to manage these feelings.  I would recommend that you seek out counseling to help you with your depression and anger.  A counselor can help you to find ways to manage your anger and depression, and to find healthy ways to communicate with your girlfriend.  If you need some support to get started, you can talk with your primary care physician or you can call your local mental health association.  You can also find a counselor using this link: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists",0.5271867513656616,5.0582790724631393e-79,0.13866666666666666,0.14256946153267153
Does counseling really do anything that can help people?,"Hi!  Great question.  I believe counseling does help people! Of course, I am a therapist, so I would think that! :)  Seriously - I think therapy and counseling allow us to understand ourselves, our motivations and the things that bring us happiness and discontent.  Therapy can create opportunities to try new skills and enhance positive attributes that are already present in someone.  I like to think of therapy as an unbiased ""aerial view"" of our lives. Someone outside can often help us notice things we might otherwise miss. Hope this helps!","Counseling is a process of working with a trained professional to explore the areas in your life that are causing you pain, distress, or confusion.  It can be an opportunity to gain new insight into your life, and to learn new skills and tools for coping with challenges.  The best way to determine if counseling is right for you is to give it a try.  You can always stop working with a therapist if you don't feel like it's a good fit.  There are many different styles of therapy, and many therapists offer a free 15 minute phone consultation where you can ask questions about their approach and experience.",0.5428997278213501,1.262897847691562e-78,0.16000000000000003,0.18628717796251612
"My mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back, and I can't seem to forgive her. I want to say that it's okay, but I can't. I feel like even if I did forgive her, I wouldn't be able to say it to her face.","How someone feels when they forgive another, is at peace with themselves and their understanding of what went wrong, who was responsible for what in the situation, and clarity on their own motivation, actions, emotions including pain, regret, resentment, sadness.These steps ideally allow a new door to open in order to develop new paths in the existing relationship or accept that this will not be possible due to either person's way of handling themselves.The long answer would be that you're not yet through with this process.I commend you on being truthful with yourself about yourself.You're on the right track by expecting to feel resolved when you've reached resolution, and not before.Finding patience with the unpredictable amount of time needed to thoroughly examine all the details of the incidents you mention, sometimes is a frustration of its own.Keep up your good work of knowing your own life.It is a worthwhile endeavor!","Hi, and thank you for your question. Forgiveness can be difficult. We all make mistakes, and sometimes we hurt other people when we do. In fact, we can't avoid it. It's a part of life. The good news is that forgiveness is possible. I don't know the details of what happened between you and your mom, but I imagine that it hurt you deeply. Forgiveness is about letting go of the anger, resentment, and bitterness that we feel towards someone who has hurt us. It's also about being able to move forward in the relationship and rebuild trust. Forgiveness is a process, and it can take time. It's not something that happens overnight. It's also important to note that forgiveness doesn't mean forgetting. It doesn't mean that what happened was okay. It just means that you are ready to move forward and let go of the hurt and anger. I'm not sure if you have read the book, ""The Four Agreements,"" by Don Miguel Ruiz. It's a really great book that talks about forgiveness, among other things. You may want to check it out. There are also many other books on forgiveness. I don't know if you would like to read about it, or if you would like to talk to someone about it. If you want to talk to someone, I would suggest a therapist or a counselor. They can help you to process your feelings and move through the forgiveness process. If you don't want to talk to someone, you can try writing in a journal. There are also some great online forgiveness exercises that you can try.

"I’m in my early 20s. My ex’s parents are friends with them and have told them bad things about me. I left my ex due to an abusive situation, and they are making me look like I was the bad one.","Maybe you can talk with your partner about this first look at the different elements of a possible conversation in the future. If you are at a place where you are willing or able to disclose the reason that you left your ex, that could be one element of the discussion, but it doesn't have to be.I don't know how long we have been together with your current partner, but perhaps his or her parents would see you for who you are and make their own opinions over time.

You can't control what other people think or say, but you can control your reactions to it. If you're able to, I'd suggest trying to focus on the people who are supportive of you and spend your time with them. If you're concerned about how this is impacting your relationship with your ex, you may want to consider talking to him about it.

How does a person start the counseling process?,"I'd recommend looking on psychologtoday.com, reading the bio's of potential therapists who you think you would relate best with, then contact them through e-mail or on the phone.","You can start the counseling process by looking up therapists online, by searching for a therapist on your insurance panel, or by calling a local helpline. When you find a therapist you are interested in, call and schedule an appointment. The first step is usually a phone consultation where you can ask questions and find out if the therapist is a good fit for you. Then you can schedule an in person appointment.",0.5536829829216003,1.0795387498884647e-231,0.11428571428571428,0.15384615384615385
"I find that I imagine things sexually, and I hate it because it puts strain on my relationship. I feel helpless and guilty. I want it to go away, and I want to make my woman happy again.","It is completely understandable that you would like to find a way to make these intrusive thoughts go away, however, your feeling that you can't control having these thoughts is accurate. It's also understandable that you would feel helpless and guilty, given that you see how these thoughts are effecting your relationship, though I would encourage you to go easy on yourself and remember that you aren't choosing to have these thoughts. I'm sure that if there was a switch to turn them off, you would flip it.There is no magic technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away, however, therapy may still have a lot to offer. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into where these thoughts are coming from and develop new ways of relating to them so that they do not leave you feeling as helpless and guilty and can be more present with your partner. Though there is no guarantee that the thoughts will go away, this may also be a result of work with a therapist. Either way, you may be able to find a way to deal with the thoughts and show up in your relationship in a way that will be satisfying to you and your partner.","If you're imagining things sexually with other people, then you're not being faithful to your partner. You may be able to stop thinking about these things, but you're still doing something wrong. Your partner needs to know what's going on and needs to decide if she can forgive you and trust you again. You may want to seek out counseling so that you can address these issues and find a way to be happy in your relationship.",0.57462477684021,0.018249066378871345,0.18666666666666665,0.13970279149177467
"I am a female, and I am afraid of having sex. I am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced. I think he thinks I'm not a virgin. I am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body. I don't want my partner to think differently of me because I am afraid of having sex.","As hard as it may be to do this, since all the media and marketing of how an ideal person looks and performs sexually, surrounds us, keep in mind that the images presented in order to sell movies and almost any product, is meant to trigger fantasies.No one is a fantasy, we are all real and unique.  We can be influenced to believe that being a fantasy is better than being who each of us is, genuinely.Your partner may be much more accepting of your body and your level of sexual experience, than you are of yourself!Sex within a relationship means the two people want to have with the other one, not because they have ideal bodies and expertise, but because the person wants to make love to the one whom they love.When you are in a loving relationship, part of this includes talking about sensitivities and insecurities.  Having a conversation gives the chance to know that you are accepted for who you are, not how closely you resemble a made up idea meant to persuade people to buy items.","Hi! This is a very common fear that many women have. I have worked with many women to help them feel more comfortable with their bodies and to help them feel confident about their sexuality. The first step is to understand that there are many different ways to have sex and you don't have to do anything that you are not comfortable with. Your partner should be able to respect your boundaries and to not pressure you into doing anything that you don't want to do. If you are in a relationship, I would encourage you to have an open conversation with your partner about your fears. You can let him know what you are comfortable with and what you would like to try. You can also let him know what your fears are and that you would like to take things slow and to do what feels good for you. It is important to remember that you should never feel pressured to do anything that you are not comfortable with. If you are not in a relationship, I would encourage you to take things slow and to do what feels good for you. You can explore your body on your own and to learn what feels good.

Dissociation is our mind's way of disconnecting us from aspects of our experience in an attempt to protect us in overwhelming situations.

This is a very serious situation, and you should see a counselor or therapist as soon as possible. It sounds like you are experiencing some serious symptoms of depression, anxiety, or possibly a dissociative disorder. I don't know if you have had a diagnosis from a medical professional, but if you have, it would be a good idea to share this information with a counselor. If you haven't, then seeing a counselor is still a good idea. The counselor can help you determine what is going on and how to address it. If you are not sure where to go, your primary care physician can probably help you find someone. You can also try calling your insurance company and asking for a list of counselors that they will cover. If you are a student, you can also check with your school. Most colleges and universities have counseling centers that provide free counseling to students. You can also check with your local mental health association.

"My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the ""straight and narrow"" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that I'm not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others.    His insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","You are right that his insecurities are at the root of the issue.  You cannot change that for him.  He will have to do the work to handle those emotions on his own.  What you can do is reassure him in whatever ways possible, but always recognizing that you can't ""fix"" this for him.  When I work with people who struggle with their partner's past experiences, I always frame it like this:  Everything that you've experienced has resulted in you being the person you are today.  The person they claim to love.  If you had not gone through some of those experiences, you would not be in the position you're in now, ready to commit to him and know that you're satisfied with that.  Just as when bad things happen to us, we have to find a way to appreciate the lessons learned your fiance has to accept that you're the person you are today because of what you have gone through.  Celebrate that you have moved through that and have landed in this perfect position with him!Hope that helps, Allison","It sounds like your fiance is holding onto the past and it is creating a barrier between you.  It is not possible to change him, but you can change your own behavior.  You can start by setting some boundaries.  For example, you may decide that you are not willing to have the same conversation about your past over and over again.  You can also decide that you are not willing to be with someone who is unwilling to accept your past.  This is a difficult place to be in, but it is important to protect yourself and set healthy boundaries.  It is also important to remember that you cannot change him.  You can encourage him to seek out counseling for himself and continue to set boundaries for yourself.",0.5472350120544434,4.112597948501148e-155,0.16455696202531644,0.20474322452092966

Intimacy is a very natural human desire and at the same time learning to enjoy ourselves, even when we are alone, can strengthen our ability to lead a satisfying life in and out of relationship. Working with a therapist, you may be able to gain insight into how you show up in your relationships with yourself and others and discover more fulfilling ways to do so.",It sounds like you are feeling sad and lonely since the people who made you happy are no longer around.  I think it is very normal to feel sad when someone we care about is no longer around.  It is also natural to miss someone who makes us feel happy and valued.  I think the most important thing is to allow yourself to feel the sadness and to give yourself the time and space to grieve this loss.  It is also important to remember that you are not alone in feeling sad and that there are people who care about you and want to be around you.  You may also want to consider joining a support group where you can meet others who are going through a similar experience.  You may also want to consider meeting with a therapist to help you work through the grief process.  You may also want to consider joining a group or taking a class where you can meet new people and have the opportunity to make new friends.  I hope this was helpful and I wish you the best of luck.,0.5673696994781494,0.029889725498851966,0.20863309352517986,0.2846929870734849
"I'm a young adult woman, and I have trouble finding my true identity being at home. This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I don't know why. I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldn't like it. My parents are very religious—they're Christians. We did things every time he'd come over to my house. We didn't have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we'd watch movies by ourselves.
   One day, my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. As soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. They were both aggravated. They told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. They said he wanted me for sex and he's not a Christian. I took their advice and broke up with him. Once we broke up for about a month, I decided to get back together with him a little after school started. My parents found out eventually, and I decided to not listen this time. I would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and God totally forbids him. I would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually I would just never listen to my parents. They're always yelling at me about how I shouldn't date this boy. I felt too old to listen to them. Now I'm kind of just stuck. Is the real me religious? Have I been brainwashed by him? I don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think I'm deceiving because of it. They threatened me that if I'm still with him, I can't do track and they won't support me. They've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. They say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. I'm actually very happy with him. They also say I'm living a separate life at home than I am at school. They say they want what's best for me and love me because they adopted me.","What a tough situation you must be in, feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you. I would say the first thing you want to do is (if you haven't already), have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents, telling them how you feel and letting them know what you need from them. If communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward. You, unfortunately, will not be able to change your parent's feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from the relationship you have with your parents. It always helps to try and see things from another angle. You might want to, for example, try and understand your parent's perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset. Validating other's feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively. Are you living with your parents and do they support you? If so, are you willing to give that up should you decide to not follow their rules? Know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply. Your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper. Not everyone will always approve of the choices we make and sometimes we need to be okay with that. Best of luck to you.","I am so sorry to hear about the situation you are in. You are right to be concerned about the way your parents are treating you. They are making your life miserable and putting you down in very hurtful ways. You are not alone. There are many parents who treat their children like this. You are in a difficult situation because you are living under your parents' roof and they have a lot of power over you. You can't just kick them out. You can't go to a therapist by yourself without their permission. And, you can't leave home until you are 18. The good news is that you are in school and you have a boyfriend. You can start by telling your boyfriend about your situation. You may be able to find a support system there. If you are comfortable doing so, you can start by talking to a school counselor about your situation. I don't know if you are in high school or college. But, most schools have counselors who can help you with your situation. They can also help you to talk to your parents and help you to understand your rights. You may also be able to talk to other people who are close to you. If you have aunts or uncles or other family members that you can trust, you may be able to talk to them about your situation. As far as finding your own identity, that is something that you will have to work on. You can't wait for your parents to let you do what you want. You have to decide for yourself what you want and what you believe. It is okay to disagree with your parents. You don't have to believe what they believe. You can start by making decisions for yourself. You can decide what you want to do and what you want to wear and what you want to talk about. You can also start by making your own decisions about your boyfriend. You can decide if you want to be with him or not. You can decide how far you want to go with him. You can decide how you want to talk to your parents about your relationship. You can also start by talking to other people who are your age. You can start by talking to your friends. You can start by talking to your boyfriend. You can start by talking to your school counselor. You can start by talking to other people who are close to you. I hope this helps. You can do this. You are not alone. There are other people who are going through the same thing as you. You can find a support system. You can find your own identity.",0.6108217239379883,0.024511302607965454,0.1864406779661017,0.2872884691066509

I'm very hurt and confused.","Congrats on having your daughter!Have you told your partner about your feelings of ""hurt and confused""?This is one possible way of opening a conversation about the different ways you each feel about one another and whether either of you would like changing or continuing to live together, in light of the change in emotional connection.The first step of having a dialogue about a relationship is being clear on what you are feeling, what you are willing to contribute to the relationship and what you would like having in return from your partner.Ask your partner if she is willing to have a conversation on these topics.  Then, allow some time so each of you is clear about their own expectations and what is possible to offer the other.This is a fairly complex process and very often is difficult to keep on track without outside help to keep the discussion focused.It is normal for emotions to override our logic when discussing matters we care about deeply.If the conversations don't go very far, or if your partner has no interest in talking, stick with your own interest to more fully understand matters.Interview some therapists to find one whom you feel helps you clarify and find direction for yourself about this situation.","Hello.  I am sorry to hear about your relationship difficulties.  Relationships are difficult, and it sounds like you and your girlfriend are in a rough place.  There are a few things I am curious about.  One, how old is your daughter?  Two, how old are you and your girlfriend?  Three, what do you think is causing the disconnect between you and your girlfriend?  Four, how do you feel about your girlfriend talking to other men?  Five, what are your goals for the relationship?  Six, what are your girlfriend's goals for the relationship?  I would suggest that you have a conversation with your girlfriend about the relationship and ask her if she would be open to couples counseling.  If she is not willing to do that, I would suggest that you do individual therapy to process your feelings and thoughts about the relationship.  You do not need to be in a relationship that is hurting you.  If you decide to stay in the relationship, I would suggest that you set some boundaries.  For example, you may want to set boundaries around communication with other people.  You may want to say that you are not comfortable with her talking to other men.  You may also want to set boundaries around your daughter.  For example, you may want to set boundaries around how much time she spends with her daughter.  It sounds like there are a lot of issues that need to be addressed in your relationship.  I would suggest that you seek professional help to address these issues.  I wish you the best.  ~Mark (www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com and www.LivingYes.org)",0.5643486380577087,1.3467188734467697e-78,0.1806981519507187,0.24099204492278897

My sister always brings up how I was never close to my mother.","Wow what a painful journey you have been in for a long time. Death and grief bring up so many painful reminders of relationships--what they could have been, never were, and what was lost. With death of a family member the family often falls apart for a while... or longer. I hope you can find some support for you and your pain that was occurring before your mom's passing. I also hope you can find someone to help you set boundaries with your sister so you can have your time (as long as you need) to heal from losing your mom and then later figure out how to interact with your sister.

"I was anxious to go to middle school. I was afraid of what people might say about me, so when school started, I wasn't acting like myself. I was quiet, which I'm usually not. I didn't talk to anybody and didn't have any friends. Then a few years later, my grandma died. I really became depressed and stop going to school for a little. I hated myself and still do. I just need help. I need someone to care for me. I need someone to show that they care.","I agree; you need more care and support. No one deserves to feel alone, or like they hate themselves. We're all wonderful, imperfect, complicated people and we're at our best when we're all helping each other. I'm glad you wrote this question, because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes. I can tell that you're smart, because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connected...you ""not being yourself"", and then how you felt when your grandma died. When Grandma died, you needed and deserved extra love and support, but the people around you didn't seem to give it to you, maybe. My hunch is that they wanted to, but that they didn't know how much you needed it, or what you needed exactly. The older you get, the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need. Maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature, but that's how it works. When you started middle school, it sounds like you changed; you got more quiet, right? That must have felt weird, to not be acting like yourself. It sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldn't like you. Fear can be silly. So then, fear got you to not show yourself, and when we don't show ourselves, people can't see who we are; they don't know us as well and then they don't know what we need and they can't care for us as well either. Fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you. It does that to a lot of us. So, where you're at right now is because of what fear did to you, and also because when Grandma died you were already isolated so people couldn't see your pain and know that you needed support. There's a simple solution, but you'd have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say ""Get off my back!"". ""You're not helping me by telling me lies."" Can you be brave enough to go back to your old, louder, self? If you talk to the people closest to you...tell them what you think and how you feel, then they'll be able to give you the care that you want and deserve. I wish you well as you try this!","It sounds like you have been through a lot and are looking for some support. I am glad that you are reaching out for support. I am not sure if you have talked to your parents about how you are feeling, but that is a good place to start. If you feel comfortable, you could also talk to a school counselor. If you have a friend that you trust, you could try talking to them. It can be really helpful to talk to someone who understands what you are going through. I would also encourage you to try to focus on the things that you can control. You can't control how other people act, but you can control how you act.

I am so glad you asked this question. It can be so frustrating to send a message and not receive a reply.

It could be that you are overwhelming them. Try sending them a short, sweet message and see if that gets a response. I would also think about the type of relationship you have with the person. If you are friends with them, maybe they are not as close to you as you are to them. I know that may be hard to accept, but it happens.

"I'm in my late teens and live with my dad. The only time I go out is for my college classes.

Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.
   Are they right, am I depressed?","I'm alway wary of assigning a term to a feeling, as often that term becomes more important than the feeling itself. From the very little that you have written, it is clear that you are going through something that has made you extremely low, affected your self-esteem and motivation, limits your enjoyment of formerly pleasurable activities and affects your feelings of self-worth. All of these are aspects of being depressed, though you can be depressed and still not have ""depression"". Counseling is definitely a place where you can go and sort out why you have had such a sudden a drastic change to your mood. Sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine, losses or significant disappointments. Talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way, but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the future. I do hope that you will reach out. Feeling alone can be harmful over long periods of time, as it can stop us from seeking out the support we need.","It is possible that you are depressed.  Depression can look different for everyone, but there are some common symptoms that you may want to pay attention to.  If you are having trouble sleeping, have changes in your appetite, lack energy, have trouble concentrating, feel hopeless, or have thoughts of suicide, it would be a good idea to talk to someone right away.  If you are experiencing some of these symptoms, but not all, it may still be a good idea to talk to someone about how you are feeling.  Sometimes it is difficult to see how we are feeling because we get caught up in our own thoughts.  A counselor may be able to help you identify some of these thoughts and help you change them.  In addition, it is normal to feel sad or down from time to time.  Sometimes, it may be a reaction to something that has happened.  In this case, it may help to talk with a counselor to process the event and help you move through the emotions that are connected to it.  I hope this was helpful.  Be well.",0.5987428426742554,1.9120230384798697e-78,0.1784776902887139,0.24865991894323977

Finding the right therapist can be tricky because you don't really know how someone will be like until you meet them. A few ways to prescreen are to:- Visit the therapist's website, psychologytoday profile, social media, etc...- Have a phone call with the therapist prior to your first appointmentOnce you meet your therapist it is important to be clear with your wishes and expectations. We are trained in helping you thrive in your life but we cannot mind read so if you don't tell us, we won't know. Don't be shy about what you like and what you don't like. A good therapist will listen to your needs, process them with you, and create a customized plan that works for you and your life. A good therapist will also not take anything you say (even criticism) personally. Coming to therapy is hard and often times you might not want to go. What makes a good therapist is someone who understands this and tries to make you feel as comfortable as possible while you address uncomfortable topics.","The right therapist for you is the one who is a good fit for you. This can be a process of trial and error, but there are a few things you can look for. The first is to look for a therapist who is licensed in the state that you are in and has a license that is active. You can look this up on the state regulatory board website. The second is to look for a therapist who has a specialty that matches what you are looking for. For example, if you are looking for someone to help you with depression, look for someone who specializes in depression. Third, look for someone who you feel comfortable with. If you are not comfortable, it is okay to look for someone else. It is important that you feel comfortable talking with them and that you trust them.

"My ex-fiancé (whom I am still seeing) left me because of the pressure from all three of his teenage daughters. They wanted him to try to work it out with their mom (his ex-girlfriend of 20 years). He and I split three months ago, but I have been seeing him pretty regularly despite the fact that he is living back with his ex-girlfriend and kids. He is ""co-existing"" for the kids and fighting all the time with his ex-girlfriend. His daughters don’t want their dad with me because my two boys (grown adults and on their own now) had bad reputations and issues with drugs. His daughters say it is embarrassing for him to be with me. He and I had an absolutely amazing relationship and connect on so many levels. He is getting a lot of pressure from his family and his longtime friends to ""do the right thing"" and stay with his ex-girlfriend for the kids. He says he wants me to wait. We were going get married last year. He bought me a $1000 dress, we had invitations made, and everything set up, but then his girls told him they'd never speak to him again if he married me. He says he’s trying to mend his relationship with them.","Hello. It seems you are in a set of circumstances that are highly uncomfortable for you. Do you feel those circumstances are healthy? Do you find pleasure being in such a place of uncertainty? Why do you continue to be in this situation? Without meaning to appear that I might be lacking in compassion, you do have the option to leave the connection completely if the harm it is doing is more that the pleasure it brings you. Is there a benefit to being in this relationship? Do you consider this situation to be for your highest good? Is it healthy to be involved in something that is not likely healthy or perhaps could even be seen as dysfunctional? In truth, only you can decide the answers to these very important questions. I would encourage you to think of who benefits by being in this situation, and how you might be able to find happiness in other relationships that are healthier and more positive. In my clinical view based on what I read, this particular relationship does not carry the joy I am sure you want, nor the healthy interactions you would expect in a functional romantic engagement with another person.Beating yourself up about potentially wasting all this time waiting for the other person to come around will not serve a positive purpose. It likely will only lower your self-esteem. There is a time to wait to see how things develop, and a time to move on to other experiences. You are the one to make that choice, but I would encourage you to connect with your inner higher self, for the most clear answer. Chances are, you already know the answer, you just need to embrace it. Getting in touch with a counselor in your area can also help ferret out some of the deeper issues that you might not have felt comfortable expressing here.","It sounds like you and your ex-fiancé are in a very difficult situation.

Some practitioners specifically only work with a certain type of issue (i.e eating disorders, adolescents, anger management, life transitions, anxiety...etc) and others can work with a variety of concerns. As far as training your therapist, you can't. You simply let them know what you are looking to work on or what you think may be an issue for you.

Was it objectively wrong to spend the weekend with a good friend, who also happens to be an ex? Probably not. But, it upset your current boyfriend, and he is entitled to his feelings if you are in a relationship with him. He may be out of line if he assumes that anything happened between you and your ex that would compromise the relationship, however your boyfriend being upset might also mean that he wanted to spend that kind of weekend with you and did not get to do that.Long story short, it might help your relationship to understand more, and be curious, not judge-y, around what is upsetting for him. Perhaps having empathy for his experience of the behavior could help him to feel more secure with you having relationships with your ex(es).","It's not necessarily wrong, but it depends on what you and your boyfriend have agreed upon for your relationship.  Relationships are unique to each couple.  If you and your boyfriend have a discussion about your expectations for your relationship, it may be helpful for you to share your feelings about your friend and how spending time with him upset your boyfriend.  If you can have an open discussion about your feelings, you may be able to come to an agreement about what is okay for both of you.",0.5723886489868164,1.011928698168487e-78,0.22127659574468084,0.23097460555972954

"I was raped a couple months ago, Since then, along with other unfortunately events that have occurred, I have been having trouble feeling emotions. It's almost as if I'm a sociopath lacking any feeling. What can I do to change this?","You are describing a very legitimate reaction to trauma.  Rape is an aweful experience and I am very sorry that happened to you.  When horrible things happen, people often react in a way that interferes with the ability to live a normal life and function the way they did in the past.  This is very common and the goal is to help you manage the stress caused by dealing with negative events and with help you can regain emotional well-being.  This is especially important if you have had more than one negative thing happen.  Oftentimes, the unconscious reaction is to become numb and avoid all feelings, especially if more than one negative event occurred.  A big part of what causes people trouble are feelings of guilt.  We often blame ourselves when bad things happen. It is actually difficult to comprehend the concept that we don't always have control of what happens in life.  In addition, when you mentioned feeling like a sociopath, it sounded like you feel like your reaction is wrong.  The first thing you can do is realize that your feelings and reactions are o.k., you aren't doing anything wrong, and nothing is wrong with you.  The next step is to start dealing with the impact of these traumatic experiences. Identifying your feelings, and knowing the thoughts and beliefs that are behind those emotions can help you regain your sense of happiness.  Research shows that understanding and expressing those thoughts and feelings can help.  If doesn't sound like you need to do anything to change yourself, but talking to a counselor can be helpful in managing your reaction to a incredibly traumatic experience.  I hope this helps you understand your feelings and can get to a place where you enjoy life.","Hi there.  I am so sorry for what you have experienced.  I have worked with many survivors of sexual abuse and trauma and have seen that this is a very common issue.  There are many different ways that trauma can affect us and this is one of them.  I would highly recommend seeing a therapist who specializes in trauma and EMDR.  I hope this helps.  Be well.  Robin J.

"I'm applying to private high schools. I'm playing basketball on my school team currently, and I love it. I also play on a team that I've hated since the beginning, and I finally want to quit before the season gets started. However, my parents say I can play on either both teams or neither. I think it's unfair because it's up to me if I want to play for a certain team. I was planning on playing basketball for the high school I get into, but if that means continuing to play for the team I hate, then I wouldn't want to play in high school. Now I don't know what to do! My parents are threatening to send me off to a different home if I don't play. I just want to run away.","The situation in your family seems to place unnecessary pressure on you.Are you and your parents able to talk together about their reason for their standard?Are your parents willing to listen to your reasons to not play on the team you hate?If yes, then maybe some type of compromise is possible for all of you to negotiate.If none of the above is possible, then you may want to get specific and direct advice from a professional, such as the school guidance counselor or psychologist, whom you'd trust and feel safe in talking.I hope you and your parents will find an answer that all of you are happy to accept.","Hi Cleveland,This is a tough situation. You're a kid, and your parents are making the rules. If you don't follow them, you'll be punished. It's not fair, but it's the way it is. I don't know if it's worth running away, but I do think you need to make your feelings known to your parents. You can't control what they do, but you can tell them how you feel. I'm not sure why your parents are so invested in you playing for the team you hate. If you can figure that out, maybe you can figure out a way to make it work. I'm not sure how much of a say you have in your own life, but I think you need to be heard. I think you're making a mistake in thinking that you won't play basketball in high school if you don't play on that team. That's not necessarily true. I think you should try to play on your school team, and if you don't want to, then you can find another way to play basketball. I hope you can find a way to make this work.

"Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes  I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I can't get it out.  How can I stop these thoughts?","Hi there,I first want to let you know that having these thoughts is completely normal. Studies have been done that show that 80% of human thoughts are ""negative"" so you are not alone. I like to think of thoughts as a tornado... if you are in a tornado, you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial. However, when you are, let's say, a mile away from a tornado, it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as get shelter or make sure your family and friends are safe. When unhelpful or scary thoughts arise, we tend to start a ""war"" with them, which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado. This makes the thoughts and emotions bigger and intensifies the feelings that go with them. So the question I imagine you have is ""how do I get out of the tornado?"" There are 3 steps to doing this:Get distance from your thoughts by adding ""I am noticing I'm having the thought that...."" to the front of them. For example, ""I am noticing I am having the thought that something bad is going to happen to me.""   The purpose of this is not to decrease your fear or get rid of the thought. These thoughts might always be there and that is okay because that is how the mind naturally works so struggling with that is a waste of time and energy. The purpose is to gain some distance from the thoughts so you don't get swept away by them. You can imagine them floating along like leaves in a stream or clouds in the sky (and often the same thought will come back again and again but that's okay... just continue to notice it with curiosity). I imagine the thoughts get in your way of doing what really matters to you so if you can get a little bit of distance, you can do things that are fulfilling and meaningful to you. Tune into your body and notice what sensations come up and where you feel them most intensely. Then breathe into them and make room for them. Our 5 main emotions are: joy, sadness, fear/anxiety, shame, and anger. ALL of these emotions are part of being human and there is no escaping them. So again, struggling with them ends up intensifying them. Instead, let them be and make a little bit of room for them. Often a side effect of this is the intensity will decrease but it might not. The purpose is to keep them from becoming more intense. Contact the present moment. Notice what is happening here and now. One way of doing this is tuning into the five senses. What are some things you hear, see, taste, smell, and feel? Another way is to notice what is happening in your body (without trying to change it). How deep are your breaths, what is happening with your heart rate, are you cold/warm, etc?Implementing these three steps can help you to refrain from getting caught up in your unhelpful thoughts. Unfortunately there is no way to get rid of thoughts or feelings completely. So the only option that works in the long run is to accept them while continuing to do what matters to you and what is fulfilling to you.I hope this helps!","I'm not sure if you are talking about a specific fear or a general fear of something bad happening to you.  If it is a general fear, I would suggest that you ask yourself what it is that you are afraid of.  Sometimes it helps to write down your fears.  Once you are able to name what it is that you are afraid of, you can start to work on the thought.  Sometimes the thoughts are irrational and you can work on challenging those thoughts.  For example, if you are afraid of something bad happening to you while driving, you can look at the statistics of how likely that is to happen and compare it to other things.  If it is a specific fear, such as fear of public speaking, you can also look at the statistics of how likely it is that something bad will happen.  In this case, the statistics are not very helpful, so you may need to challenge the thought by looking at what evidence you have that you can do it successfully.  You can also look at the worst thing that could happen and how you would cope with that.  You can also use relaxation techniques to help you cope with the fear.  If you are interested in working on your fears, you can consider seeing a therapist who specializes in anxiety and fears.",0.5796300172805786,5.1870227424989554e-79,0.16666666666666666,0.1481155665494257

"In 2008 my former husband of 14 years walked away from my life and we've been separated ever since. We have always been together sexually and both have experienced sleeping with others. I stopped because I wanted my marriage to work out but he did not. If he stops sleeping with other women, can our marriage be saved? Or should we just part ways? I still care deeply about him after all that I did and he has done. But he is seeing someone else on and off for years now. Will our marriage still be saved if he decides that he wants to try to do so?","Sorry to hear about the stress in your relationship.  There is definite value in being clear as you are, about your own emotional investment in your husband and that you expect sexual exclusivity from him as part of the foundation of your marriage.Also positive is your awareness that only your husband is the one who must similarly decide his own standards of being sexually exclusive to you, or not.Whether your marriage can be saved depends on what each person is willing to accept about the other one.Is sleeping with other women the only criterion of what will satisfy you about being together with your husband?Love and care are not enough to make a marriage work. Partners need to be able to compromise and cooperate with each other. That you care for him definitely intensifies any emotion you feel toward your husband.  It intensifies any frustration and sadness about the relationship too.Decide how much emotional sadness and hurt you're willing to tolerate and the reason you're willing to do so.From what you write, you are being very generous of yourself and not being reciprocated for this.If your husband doesn't start taking steps toward satisfying your wishes, this may be your time to question your own generosity in waiting for him to do so.","I'm not sure whether you are referring to your own marriage or your former husband's marriage.

"I've been going through a rough time lately. I been into nothing but women. I’ve never thought about men until a week ago. I’m very upset and depressed about this. It's not normal to me. I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that I’m not gay. I get the same results each time, and I feel disgust. This is tough on me. I'm scared that I looked too many times. I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.","Are you able to give yourself some peace of mind while you take the time to further address whether or not you are gay?Whether or not and to what degree a person accepts their sexuality, depends on dense factors such as the culture of your family, the beliefs about gay people with which you were brought up, and your own tolerance for being a unique individual.Examining these factors, whether inwardly by yourself, in online blogs and sites, or live with other people, requires patience and effort.The more you are willing to commit to figuring out your own truth, the greater is your chance of finding it!","Hello, and thank you for your question. This is a very common question that I get from people who are concerned about being gay. The short answer is that you cannot change your sexual orientation. It is not something that you can change. Now, I will say that people do sometimes ""come out"" later in life. It is not always something that you know about yourself when you are young. Sometimes people are in denial about their sexual orientation for a long time, and then they come to accept it. But, there is no way to change your sexual orientation. You mentioned that you looked at gay porn to prove that you aren't gay. I have a question for you. What are you trying to prove? Who are you trying to convince? And, why is it so important to you that you are not gay? If you are asking yourself these questions, I would suggest talking with a therapist about it. There are a lot of different things that could be going on here, and a therapist could help you sort it out. I will say that, if you are concerned about being gay, and you are worried about it, it is very important that you find a therapist who is LGBTQ affirming. If you go to a therapist who is not accepting of LGBTQ people, you could do yourself a lot of harm. There is a lot of research that shows that being LGBTQ is not a problem. It is being in a society that stigmatizes and marginalizes LGBTQ people that is the problem. So, if you go to a therapist who thinks that being gay is a problem, you could actually make yourself worse. I hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J.

I blame my past relationship for it. I know it is bad to be this way. I want to get past it.,"We humans are social beings. We learn how to BE in relationship as children. The caregiving you received (or didn't receive) set the stage for how you show up in all your adult relationships. Insecurity in relationships often has much to do with feeling unheard or unseen, perhaps feeling like you don't matter. There are many ways to rewire these relational patterns, the first step of which is taking pause and noticing that you are feeling insecure - so congrats on that because clearly you are already there!  Next I'd suggest finding a relationship therapist to help you sort through your insecurities, either as a couple or individually. ","Hi, I'm glad you're willing to do some work to change. I think that's a great start. I'm not sure whether you're referring to being jealous of your partner's other relationships, or being jealous of other people in general. I'll try to answer both ways. If you're referring to being jealous of your partner's other relationships, I'd ask you to consider what it is that you're jealous of. Is it the time they spend with others? Is it the closeness they feel? Is it the way they feel about others? Is it something else? Once you know what it is that you're feeling jealous of, you can work on getting that need met in your own life. If it's time, you can schedule time with your partner to focus on just you and them. If it's closeness, you can talk to your partner about what closeness means to you and what you'd like from them. If it's feeling loved, you can talk to your partner about how they show love and what you'd like from them. If you're jealous of others, I'd ask you to consider what it is that you're comparing yourself to. Are you comparing your life to someone else's highlight reel? Are you comparing your behind-the-scenes to someone else's highlight reel? If so, I'd encourage you to remember that you never really know what's going on behind the scenes for other people. If you're having a hard time figuring out what it is that you're feeling, I'd encourage you to work with a therapist to help you get a handle on what it is that you're feeling and what you need.

"I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.

But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. While your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard. Talk to them during a non-emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as ""you NEVER listen,"" ""you ALWAYS say..."" and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with ""you"" try using ""I"" by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist, teacher, or school counselor if possible. Most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help.Best of luck to you.","I am so sorry you feel alone and isolated.

"I have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.","Something to remember about anxiety is that it's a useful and necessary response to stressors, and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming. Anxiety is our brain's way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action. Some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. The first I'd recommend is a calm breathing technique - breathe in for 4-5 seconds, and then out for 7-8 seconds. Try to repeat this for 3-5 minutes. Another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe - without judging - the sensations to yourself. Try to be very specific, such as ""my palms are feeling very sweaty, and I can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies."" Then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad - just experiencing them as intentionally as possible.  Combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful. If you feel that these techniques don't help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to, then I'd highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional. This professional can help you determine if therapy/counseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms.","Hi there, Anxiety is the body's way of telling us that we are under stress and that we need to slow down and take care of ourselves. It's the body's natural response to stress. If we don't listen to it, we can experience burnout, depression, or even physical illness. It's a message to slow down and take care of ourselves. So, the first step is to accept that anxiety is a natural response to stress and to accept that we need to take care of ourselves. The second step is to learn to recognize when we are stressed and what the signs are that we need to take care of ourselves. These can be physical, emotional, and behavioural signs. The third step is to make a self-care plan that you can follow. This can include things like meditation, yoga, exercise, healthy eating, connecting with friends and family, and many other things. The fourth step is to follow your self-care plan. This is the hard part. We know what we need to do, but we don't always do it. This is where accountability comes in. You need to find someone who will hold you accountable to your plan. This can be a friend, family member, therapist, or coach. The fifth step is to follow through with your self-care plan and make adjustments as needed. The sixth step is to celebrate your successes. This is important because it will help you to stay motivated and on track. The seventh step is to continue to monitor your anxiety and make adjustments as needed. I hope this helps.",0.5708253979682922,5.0112056832562345e-155,0.16822429906542058,0.198634140438713

What makes a healthy marriage last?,"Thank you for your question.  A good Marriage is one that takes hard work and commitment.  Being in a good marriage does not always mean good times because let's face it; we are dealing with 2 unique individuals with differences.  A good spouse or partner knows to be patient and accepting.  Knowing each other's strengths and imperfections and working with them to lift each other is how you strengthen your love for one another.  A good spouse sacrifices their needs to see the other person happy.  Don't get me wrong, that also means that it is important to have alone time to re-charge and re-focus our purpose in the marriage.  In all, there is not a magic recipe for a successful marriage, but with time, work and purpose one can have a happy one.","Hi, I'm a therapist who specializes in working with couples. I'm also a married woman who has been happily married for 17 years. I've learned a lot from my clients and my own marriage. Here are a few things I've learned about what makes a marriage last:1. Communication is the key. Couples who communicate with each other in healthy ways are more likely to have a long-lasting marriage. It's important to be able to talk about the good, the bad and the ugly.2. Trust is important. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If you can't trust your partner, it's hard to have a lasting marriage.3. Respect is important. Respect your partner for who they are and what they do. It's important to respect each other's opinions, even if you don't agree with them.4. Forgiveness is important. No one is perfect. We all make mistakes. It's important to be able to forgive your partner for their mistakes and to be able to forgive yourself for your own mistakes.5. Commitment is important. It's important to be committed to your marriage and to be willing to work on it.6. Love is important. It's important to love your partner and to be willing to work on your relationship.",0.5747399926185608,4.930314001335793e-155,0.16438356164383564,0.25480429100225926

Anger is a normal human emotion. It is how we express ourselves when we feel frustrated, or threatened, or when we have been wronged. Anger is not the problem. How we express our anger is the problem. Some people express anger in ways that are healthy and constructive. Some people express anger in ways that are unhealthy and destructive. In your question, you describe yourself as getting ""furious"" and ""throwing things"". These are examples of unhealthy, destructive ways of expressing anger. You may be wondering, ""how do I know if my anger is a problem?"" Here are some questions that you can ask yourself to help answer that question:1. Do I have a hard time controlling my temper?2. Do I have trouble at work or in my relationships because of my anger?3. Do I have a history of violence?4. Do I ever hurt myself or someone else when I get angry?5. Do I ever feel guilty about the way I express my anger?6. Do I have trouble getting my anger to go away?7. Do I ever use drugs or alcohol to help me cope with my anger?8. Do I ever feel like I have a ""short fuse""?If you answer yes to any of these questions, it may be a good idea to seek help for your anger.

I recently lost a friend to suicide. I'm smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it. How can I handle this better?,"Suicide is a very traumatic loss and affects survivors significantly. Everyone deals with their grief in different ways. One way I recommend to deal with the loss of a loved one is to write letters to them. Some people like to keep the letters in a jar, maybe fill the jar with sand so the letters are buried. I recommend writing the letters as often as you need to. You will notice over time the need to write the letters will decrease and the intense feelings of loss will decrease. I also recommend finding a survivors support group in your area.

"Maybe this is a stupid question, but I sometimes don't know what's real or not. If feel at times like everyone's lying. How do I know if God is one of those lies?","  It is not a stupid question, it is very basic. To help answer your question, let me begin with the premise that you will never have absolute proof. With that being said, one can look at different phenomena in nature and history and figure what is the statistical probability that they happened randomly. If one comes to the logical conclusion that many are quite improbable, then there must be a guiding force and plan.  May you be successful in your journey.","This is a great question.

"I feel that I need to end my present relationship. He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.","It sounds like you have some insight into the cycle that you describe with your current relationship and at the same time you are still feeling stuck.

How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,"That's a loaded question.  Typically, if we are contemplating if we should or not, it is for a reason.  To really come to a place of decision, you need to know where you are right now, what is not working, what the potential resolution would be and if it is realistic.  If you can answer those questions, you may gain some insight.   If it is realistic and your boyfriend is on the same page, seek help putting a plan in motion for resolution.  And I mention him being on the same page because if he is not, then it will never come to fruiting.  Without much other information, this is this is a solid approach.","Hi, I'm so glad you asked this question. It's such an important one. I'm not going to tell you if you should or shouldn't end your relationship, because only you can make that decision. But I can help you think about it. One thing that comes to mind is the idea of ""red flags"" in relationships. These are things that are concerning and may be a sign that something bigger is going on. Things like: -Controlling behaviors-Extreme jealousy-Isolation from friends and family-Extreme mood swings-Intimidation-Intense need for attention-Substance abuse-Verbal or physical abuse-Extreme possessiveness-Extreme distrustI'm not saying that if your boyfriend has one of these characteristics that you should end the relationship. It's a spectrum. If he's just a little jealous, or a little controlling, that doesn't necessarily mean you should leave. But if it's extreme, it may be a sign of something more serious. Another thing to think about is if you're happy. This may seem simple, but I think it's important.

I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.,"The older I get, the more I believe that our real task isn't to 'find' ourselves. We're already 100% ""there."" What we do have to do is become more mindful of the times when we feel the most alive, most happy, most creative, and most fully engaged with life. It is in those moments that we find ourselves.For example, I couldn't help loving the people or things I loved, no matter who tried to talk me out of them. All I needed to do was notice when my heart opened and I felt the most alive--not because I was afraid or addicted, but because in those moments, I was in contact with my highest self. On the flip side, I needed to recognize the people and activities that consistently brought out the worst in me--the ones that made me feel controlled, constricted, dishonest, resentful, or afraid--and be honest about them. Mindfulness of ""what already is"" is the key to finding yourself. Align yourself with the people and activities that matter most to you. Don't let old habits, crappy jobs, or mean-spirited people define you. Just stumble your way forward as best you can, with greater self-awareness followed by affirmative action..   ","I'm sorry you are struggling to find yourself. It can be difficult to define ourselves, especially when we are in the process of growing and changing. I think it's important to remember that you don't have to have it all figured out. We are constantly changing and growing and developing new interests and passions. I think it's important to be open to that process and to embrace the idea that you can continue to grow and change. If you are struggling to find yourself, I would suggest taking some time to reflect on what you value, what you enjoy doing, and what makes you feel fulfilled. You can also try new things and see what you enjoy. You may also want to try journaling or talking with a trusted friend or family member to gain some insight into yourself.",0.5225785374641418,2.7592512680690445e-155,0.16997167138810199,0.17956972662228338
"Whenever I run into a situation that makes me upset or angry, I tend to start cursing and badly offending the person I am confronting. I say mean things to let my anger out. Whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship (like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship) I lash out not just them but at my boyfriend. I feel like I keep causing drama due to my personality. I want to be a better person and learn to let things not get to me and be happy and graceful. I hurt the ones I love with my words. I want to be better for myself and them.","Congratulations on making your way to Step One, self-observation and deciding to change a feature about how you understand and relate to others.There is extraordinary strength in being willing to notice your effect on others and consider what changes are possible.Start on the inside track of your own heart and mind.  Once you're able to understand what is driving your emotions to the point where the only reasonable way of handling them is to curse and offend people, you'd have gotten a long way in knowing your own expectations of others and how far off the mark from this in your mind, they are.For example, if you expect others to always be accepting, tolerant and happy about situations with your boyfriend, and you're hearing otherwise from people, then you can prepare yourself for possible, less than positive comments about your relationship, or you can ask people to not comment to you about your relationship at all.Basically, the more you know about yourself and are willing to accept your right to ask others to respect your views, the easier and calmer time you'll have in handling comments from others that you're not glad hearing.Also, this is a long process because you'd be trying to change long time and deep patterns of interacting.Be patient with your own learning curve and certainly consider therapy for yourself in order to have some outside guidance and support for the process you're placing yourself.","Hi Nashville, I love that you are aware of this problem and want to change it. I'm not sure what your relationship is with your boyfriend's friends, but it's a good idea to have some boundaries around how much of other people's lives we get involved in. You're right, though, that the way you handle anger is not helpful. When we are angry, we often say and do things that we regret later. I suggest you start by looking at the situations that make you angry. What is it that is getting under your skin? Is it that you don't like the way people talk about you? Is it that you don't like being left out of things? Once you know what it is that makes you angry, you can start to find ways to deal with that anger that don't hurt other people. For example, if you're angry because you don't like being left out of things, you can talk to your boyfriend about that. You can also talk to your friends about what you like and don't like. I'm not suggesting that you start telling them how to talk to each other, but you can tell them that you don't like being talked about, and that you'd prefer that they talk to you directly. If you're angry because you don't like the way people talk about you, you can tell them that. Another thing you can do is talk to your boyfriend about your anger issues. You can let him know that you are trying to work on them, and that you want to be better. You can also let him know that you don't want to hurt him, and that you are trying to be better for him too. If you're feeling really overwhelmed, you can also talk to a therapist about your anger issues.
