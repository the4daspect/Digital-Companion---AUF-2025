3153,"We weren't long distance until he joined the military.  I love him and I know he loves, me but it's complicated. He said he's not going to find someone else, but I'm afraid. How do I keep our relationship going?","You're wise to be aware of possible changes to your relationship once your bf is away from you for extended time periods.All you both can do is state your intentions and wishes, keep in contact as much as possible, and wait to see how your relationship unfolds.To a large degree, each of you is relying on faith that if the relationship is meant to last for a while, then it will.   The military may add stress.This doesn't necessarily mean the stress will dissolve the relationship.Sometimes all anyone is able to do, is try.","Long-distance relationships, especially when one partner is in the military, can be challenging, but they are absolutely possible with effort, trust, and communication.

315,"I have no real friends. I have a girlfriend who irritates me but loves me to death. I push her away and pushes me away. We’re going through a breakup, and I have nobody.","Having time all to yourself may be necessary so you have time to reflect on your own identity and values, become more clear on what matters most to you, and with this increased self-understanding, be able to attract people who will feel like satisfying friends.Having a relationship with someone whom you push away and are pushed away, with someone who is irritating, seems to have limited benefit for each of you.Maybe you are together from fear of being alone, and being alone is exactly what you may now need in your life in order to draw more favorable people to you.","I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. Breakups can be incredibly painful, especially when you feel isolated or like you don’t have a support system. It’s okay to feel lost and overwhelmed right now—this is a tough situation, and your emotions are valid.

Here are a few thoughts that might help:

### 1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**
   - It’s okay to feel lonely, frustrated, or even confused. These emotions are part of processing what you’re going through. Try not to judge yourself for feeling this way.

### 2. **Reach Out, Even If It’s Hard**
   - Even if you feel like you have no one, there might be people in your life—family, acquaintances, or even old friends—who would be willing to listen. Sometimes, we underestimate how much others care or are willing to support us.

### 3. **Consider Professional Help**
   - Talking to a therapist or counselor can be incredibly helpful during times like this. They can provide a safe space to process your emotions and help you navigate your feelings about your relationship and loneliness.

### 4. **Reflect on the Relationship**
   - It sounds like your relationship with your girlfriend was complicated. Take some time to think about what worked, what didn’t, and what you want in future relationships. This can help you grow and avoid similar patterns.

### 5. **Focus on Yourself**
   - Use this time to reconnect with yourself. Explore hobbies, interests, or goals you’ve put on hold. Building a stronger relationship with yourself can help you feel less dependent on others for validation or companionship.

### 6. **Join Communities**
   - Consider joining groups or activities where you can meet new people. This could be a club, class, online community, or volunteer organization. Shared interests can be a great way to form connections.

### 7. **Be Patient with Yourself**
   - Healing takes time. It’s okay to feel like you’re in a low place right now, but it won’t last forever. Small steps toward self-care and connection can make a big difference over time.

### 8. **Practice Self-Compassion**
   - Be kind to yourself. It’s easy to be critical when you’re feeling down, but try to treat yourself with the same kindness you’d offer a friend in your situation.

You’re not alone, even if it feels that way right now. There are people out there who care about you, and there are ways to build new connections and find meaning in this challenging time. Take it one step at a time—you’ve got this.",0.48732835054397583
2179,I feel like my time is going too fast,"Thank you for reaching out! That is a great question! As an American, I can truly say that I spend way too much time on the go! It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe! I often ask myself, what if I only had one day left on this Earth? What would I do? Well, that is an easy question. I would spend it with my family! Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World, right? Its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring.Time management is a very important factor when learning to ""live life to the fullest""! In fact, this is a required course in undergraduate college now. Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this. Personally, for myself I like to keep a calendar with a to-do list. I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list. That way, if I do not get through the list, I am not stressing over the little things. When planning your day, it is important you schedule work, eat and play. A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. There is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this, then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse/partner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there. Again, everyone has their own style on time management. I hope this was helpful for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out for anything further!","It's a common feeling to sense that time is slipping by quickly, especially when life is busy or filled with routines. Here are a few thoughts and suggestions that might help you feel more in control of your time:

1. **Mindfulness and Presence**  
   - Practice being fully present in the moment. When you’re engaged in an activity, try to focus on it without distractions. This can help you feel like you’re making the most of your time.  
   - Mindfulness exercises, like deep breathing or meditation, can help slow down your perception of time.

2. **Prioritize What Matters**  
   - Reflect on what’s truly important to you. Are you spending your time on things that align with your values and goals?  
   - Let go of activities or commitments that don’t add meaning to your life.

3. **Break the Routine**  
   - Time can feel like it’s flying by when days blend together. Try introducing small changes or new experiences to break the monotony.  
   - Explore a new hobby, take a different route to work, or plan a spontaneous outing.

4. **Track and Reflect**  
   - Keep a journal or planner to track how you spend your time. This can help you identify patterns and make intentional changes.  
   - At the end of each day, reflect on what you accomplished and what brought you joy.

5. **Set Boundaries**  
   - Protect your time by saying no to things that drain your energy or don’t align with your priorities.  
   - Create dedicated time for rest and self-care.

6. **Focus on Gratitude**  
   - Practicing gratitude can help you appreciate the moments you have, even if they feel fleeting.  
   - Take time to notice and savor small, meaningful moments throughout your day.

7. **Slow Down**  
   - Intentionally slow down your pace. For example, take a walk without your phone, enjoy a meal without rushing, or spend time in nature.  

Remember, feeling like time is moving too fast is often a sign that you’re deeply engaged in life. While it can be unsettling, it’s also an opportunity to reflect on how you want to spend your time and make adjustments to create a more fulfilling experience.",0.3731953501701355
2929,"He wants to wear makeup and heels. He even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina. He wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him. I have tried this for him, but I don’t like it and have told him so. He keeps making comments about it and says he can't live without it.","It sounds like you may be asking two different questions.With regard to what you said about your husband dressing as a female in your bedroom, I wonder if you would consider asking him more about this. If you choose to do that, I would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience. This can be difficult to do at times, particularly when you may want to offer your own opinions or become very anxious or of type. Consider thinking of a phrase that may help you to stay calm during the discussion. It may be helpful to think of yourself as asking questions as if you were an investigative reporter and using questions that start with words like ""what, how, who, where, when."" Questions that start with ""why,"" can be very difficult to answer for some people and can be overwhelming because it often links to answers involving emotions that may or may not be understood. Also try restating what your husband is saying to make sure that you are understanding correctly. If what he is telling you is different than what you have heard or thought of for many years, it may be challenging to follow his meaning initially. Remember that listening to your husband does not imply agreement with what he is saying, just that you are following and looking to understand what he is experiencing. I also recommend sticking to one topic for the conversation, but this could be done with many different topics over time.You could also see if he would be willing to have a discussion where he listens like an investigative reporter to learn more about the experience that you are having.As far as what you mentioned about the sexual experience, maybe if you can discuss what it is that you don't like and/or understand what it is that he does like, you could see if there is some middle ground here. It depends on what you both prefer.These types of conversations can be difficult to have for some couples, at least initially. Having structured conversations, such as the ones I've described briefly above, can feel awkward initially, but the reason it can be helpful is because it can lead to further understanding in a way that decreases the chances of having an argument.Also consider seeing a therapist in your area who specializes in couples to discuss some of these ideas.","It sounds like you're navigating a complex and sensitive situation in your relationship. It's important to approach this with mutual respect, open communication, and a focus on both of your needs and boundaries.

Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Revisit the Conversation**: Have an honest and calm discussion about your feelings. Clearly express that while you’ve tried to accommodate his desires, it’s not something you’re comfortable with or enjoy. Emphasize that your boundaries are just as important as his needs.

2. **Acknowledge His Feelings**: Let him know you understand how important this is to him, but also explain that your comfort and consent are essential for a healthy relationship.

3. **Explore Compromises**: If you’re open to it, discuss other ways to explore intimacy that might satisfy both of you. For example, there may be other activities or dynamics that align with both of your desires.

4. **Set Boundaries**: If he continues to pressure you after you’ve clearly stated your discomfort, it’s important to set firm boundaries. Let him know that pressuring you is not acceptable and that mutual respect is non-negotiable.

5. **Seek Support**: If this issue is causing significant strain, consider seeking the help of a therapist or counselor, either individually or as a couple. A professional can help facilitate communication and provide guidance on navigating differences in sexual preferences.

6. **Evaluate the Relationship**: If his needs and your boundaries are fundamentally incompatible, it may be worth considering whether this relationship is fulfilling for both of you. A healthy relationship should prioritize mutual respect, consent, and emotional well-being.

Remember, your feelings and boundaries are valid, and it’s okay to prioritize your comfort and happiness.",0.4281328320503235
430,"I am a really shy person. I'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?","First of all, way to go in stretching yourself out of your comfort zone! You are sure to grow through all of this practice presenting to your peers, and that in itself will help to grow your confidence over time. In the meantime, do whatever you can to help yourself feel prepared for each presentation. Do your work ahead of time so that you feel well-informed on your topic, and then spend the days leading up to your presentation practicing. Do your presentation in the mirror, while you are driving (if it won't distract you from the road), and practice in front of a friend. On the day of the presentation, eat a balanced meal, get a pep talk from a supportive friend, use deep breathing to keep your body calm, and remind yourself that you are prepared. You got this!","It's completely normal to feel stressed and less confident about presentations, especially if you're shy. The good news is that confidence can be built over time with practice and the right strategies. Here are some actionable tips to help you feel more confident during presentations:

### 1. **Prepare Thoroughly**
   - **Know your material inside and out.** The more familiar you are with your content, the more confident you'll feel.
   - **Practice multiple times.** Rehearse your presentation in front of a mirror, record yourself, or practice with a trusted friend or family member.
   - **Anticipate questions.** Think about potential questions your audience might ask and prepare answers in advance.

### 2. **Start Small**
   - **Practice in low-pressure settings.** Share your ideas in smaller group discussions or informal settings to get comfortable speaking in front of others.
   - **Gradually increase the audience size.** Start with presenting to a few people and work your way up to larger groups.

### 3. **Focus on Your Strengths**
   - **Remind yourself of your expertise.** You’re in a graduate program because you’re knowledgeable and capable. Trust in your abilities.
   - **Highlight what you’re good at.** If you’re great at explaining concepts or telling stories, incorporate those skills into your presentation.

### 4. **Use Visualization Techniques**
   - **Imagine success.** Visualize yourself delivering a confident, engaging presentation and receiving positive feedback.
   - **Practice deep breathing.** Before your presentation, take a few deep breaths to calm your nerves and center yourself.

### 5. **Reframe Your Mindset**
   - **Shift your focus from yourself to your audience.** Remember that your goal is to share valuable information, not to impress others.
   - **Embrace imperfection.** It’s okay to make mistakes—everyone does. What matters is how you recover and keep going.

### 6. **Engage with Your Audience**
   - **Make eye contact.** Focus on friendly faces in the audience to create a connection and reduce feelings of isolation.
   - **Ask questions or invite participation.** Engaging your audience can make the presentation feel more like a conversation and less like a performance.

### 7. **Seek Feedback**
   - **Ask for constructive feedback.** After your presentation, ask peers or mentors for specific ways to improve.
   - **Learn from each experience.** Reflect on what went well and what you can do better next time.

### 8. **Take Care of Yourself**
   - **Get enough rest.** Being well-rested can help you think clearly and stay calm.
   - **Exercise regularly.** Physical activity can reduce stress and boost your mood.
   - **Practice self-compassion.** Be kind to yourself and acknowledge your efforts, even if things don’t go perfectly.

### 9. **Join a Public Speaking Group**
   - **Consider joining Toastmasters or a similar group.** These organizations provide a supportive environment to practice public speaking and build confidence.

### 10. **Celebrate Small Wins**
   - **Acknowledge your progress.** Every time you complete a presentation, take a moment to recognize your achievement, no matter how small it feels.

Remember, confidence is a skill that grows with practice. Be patient with yourself and keep pushing your boundaries. Over time, you’ll find that presenting becomes less intimidating and more empowering. You’ve got this!",0.49084895849227905
1315,"I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental.
   I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?","It is very good news that you realize the risks of smoking cigarettes while pregnant and are willing to stop.Thinking about smoking is a typical and frequent reaction to being without the substance.Be creative with what you know about yourself to distract you when this psychological urge comes up.  My suggestions are to imagine smoking if you find this would relieve the sense of wanting to smoke.Or, do the opposite and remind yourself of all the good reasons to not smoke.Also, since you're planning pregnancy then ask your partner for ideas on how to make the psychological feeling to want to smoke, feel less intense.Another suggestion is that your partner is your texting buddy to stop smoking.   With AA groups, a sponsor is always available for the alcoholic who feels distress about the urge to drink.   Having a trusted and caring person to tell about your problem helps in many situations.  Maybe it will help you to stop smoking.Good luck!","Congratulations on your decision to quit smoking for your health and the well-being of your future baby! Quitting smoking is a challenging journey, especially when it’s tied to mental habits and emotional triggers. Here are some strategies to help you overcome both the physical and mental aspects of smoking addiction:

---

### **1. Understand Your Triggers**
   - **Identify situations** where you crave smoking (e.g., stress, boredom, after meals, or with coffee).
   - Keep a journal to track when and why you feel the urge to smoke. This awareness can help you prepare for those moments.

---

### **2. Replace the Habit**
   - **Find alternatives** to keep your hands and mouth busy, such as chewing sugar-free gum, snacking on healthy foods (e.g., carrot sticks, nuts), or sipping water or herbal tea.
   - Try deep breathing exercises, meditation, or mindfulness practices to calm your mind when cravings hit.

---

### **3. Build a Support System**
   - Share your goal with family, friends, or a support group. Having people to encourage you can make a big difference.
   - Consider joining a smoking cessation program or seeking professional help, such as counseling or therapy.

---

### **4. Manage Stress**
   - Smoking is often a way to cope with stress. Explore healthier stress-relief techniques, such as yoga, exercise, journaling, or listening to calming music.
   - Practice self-compassion—quitting is hard, and it’s okay to take it one day at a time.

---

### **5. Stay Active**
   - Physical activity can reduce cravings and improve your mood. Even a short walk or stretching can help distract you from the urge to smoke.
   - Exercise also releases endorphins, which can boost your mental well-being.

---

### **6. Use Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)**
   - If the physical withdrawal is intense, talk to your doctor about NRT options like patches, gum, or lozenges. These can help ease the transition while protecting your baby from harmful chemicals in cigarettes.

---

### **7. Visualize Your Goals**
   - Remind yourself why you’re quitting—your health, your baby’s health, and the benefits of a smoke-free life.
   - Create a visual reminder, like a picture of a healthy baby or a smoke-free family, to keep you motivated.

---

### **8. Break the Mental Association**
   - If smoking is tied to specific routines (e.g., after meals), change those routines. For example, take a walk after eating instead of reaching for a cigarette.
   - Replace smoking-related thoughts with positive affirmations, like “I am stronger than this craving” or “I am creating a healthier future for my baby.”

---

### **9. Celebrate Small Wins**
   - Quitting is a process, and every smoke-free day is a victory. Reward yourself with something you enjoy (e.g., a treat, a new book, or a relaxing activity).

---

### **10. Seek Professional Help if Needed**
   - If you’re struggling, don’t hesitate to reach out to a healthcare provider, therapist, or smoking cessation specialist. They can provide personalized strategies and support.

---

### **Remember:**
   - Cravings are temporary and usually last only a few minutes. Distract yourself until they pass.
   - Relapse doesn’t mean failure. If you slip up, forgive yourself and recommit to your goal.

You’re taking a powerful step toward a healthier future for yourself and your baby. Stay patient, stay focused, and believe in your ability to succeed! 🌟",0.4198768138885498
1164,"I found the guy I’m dating on dating websites. He was telling women that they were beautiful. He said it wasn’t him and that the phone was hacked. It has since happened two other times. He says he loves me and I’m the only girl he wants to be with, but I feel he is not telling me the truth.","I would suggest possibly talking about the type of relationship that both of you want to create. For example, you may want a relationship where honesty, listening, compassion, and romanticism are major parts. You could also see what your boyfriend wants.You may also consider taking five minutes to see if he will listen to your feelings about him being on the dating site and whether he can work to learn more about what you are experiencing with asking open-ended questions (not being answered with yes or no) and restating what you are saying to see if he has it right. After that, perhaps you could switch so that you can listen to his perspective for five minutes and learn more about what he is doing by asking open-ended questions.Remember that it takes two people to have  a relationship, so the choice is yours as to whether you choose to stay in the relationship and what kind of relationship you would like to have.","It’s understandable that you’re feeling hurt, confused, and skeptical about this situation. Trust is a cornerstone of any healthy relationship, and when it’s compromised, it can be hard to move forward. Here are some things to consider:

1. **The Hacking Excuse**: While it’s technically possible for someone’s account to be hacked, it’s highly unlikely that it would happen multiple times, especially in a way that involves flirting with others. This excuse seems suspicious and could be a red flag.

2. **His Actions vs. Words**: He says he loves you and wants to be with you, but his behavior on dating apps suggests otherwise. Actions often speak louder than words, and his continued presence on these platforms (whether he’s active or not) is concerning.

3. **Your Feelings Matter**: You’re feeling uneasy because your gut is telling you something isn’t right. Trust your instincts. If something feels off, it’s worth addressing. You deserve honesty and respect in a relationship.

4. **Open Communication**: Have a calm, honest conversation with him about how this situation makes you feel. Pay attention to how he responds. Is he defensive, dismissive, or willing to take accountability? His reaction can tell you a lot about his intentions.

5. **Boundaries and Trust**: If he truly values the relationship, he should be willing to take steps to rebuild your trust. This might include deleting his dating profiles or being more transparent about his actions. If he’s unwilling to do so, it’s a sign he may not be fully committed.

6. **Evaluate the Relationship**: Ask yourself if this relationship is meeting your needs and making you happy. Are you willing to stay with someone who may not be fully honest with you? You deserve someone who respects and values you enough to be truthful.

Ultimately, trust your instincts and prioritize your emotional well-being. If you feel he’s not being honest, it may be time to reevaluate the relationship and consider whether it’s healthy for you to continue.",0.4949439764022827

If you feel safe doing so, you could also address the situation with the people who yelled at you, letting them know how their reaction affected you.

506,"I’ve been on 0.5 mg of Xanax twice a day for the past month. It hasn't been helping me at all, but when I take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack, it calms me down. I was wondering how I can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking I'm abusing them. I just have very big anxiety attacks. Should I stay on the 0.5mg and deal with the attacks or should I ask to up the dose? I'm afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else.","Do you think you're abusing xanax?It is a highly addictive drug so maybe one reason you feel compelled to take more is bc you already are addicted.Drugs don't do anything helpful in solving life's problems.   Once the effect wears off, the stressful situation is once again waiting for you to address it.Think over your reason for not directly asking your psychologist about upping your dose.Also, do you ever talk about your life problems with this psychologist or only your need for drugs?    The more gradual path to a better life is to not need drugs in the first place. This consists of your willingness to face the matters that are creating such terrible feelings inside you.","It's important to approach this conversation with your psychologist in a thoughtful and transparent way. Here are some steps to help you communicate your needs effectively:

### 1. **Be Honest and Specific**
   - Describe your experiences clearly: ""I’ve been taking 0.5 mg of Xanax twice a day, but it doesn’t seem to help with my day-to-day anxiety. However, when I take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack, it does calm me down.""
   - Emphasize that you’re not seeking to abuse the medication but rather to find relief from your symptoms.

### 2. **Explain Your Concerns**
   - Share your fear of being taken off the medication or switched to something else: ""I’m worried that if I ask for a higher dose, you might think I’m abusing it or decide to take me off it entirely. That’s not my intention—I just want to manage my anxiety effectively.""

### 3. **Ask for Their Expertise**
   - Show that you trust their judgment: ""I’d like to hear your thoughts on whether increasing the dose to 1 mg twice a day might be appropriate for my situation, or if there are other options we could explore.""

### 4. **Discuss Alternative Solutions**
   - Be open to other approaches: ""If you think increasing the dose isn’t the best option, are there other strategies or medications we could consider to help manage my anxiety attacks?""

### 5. **Highlight Your Commitment to Treatment**
   - Reassure them that you’re committed to finding a safe and effective solution: ""I want to work with you to find the best way to manage my anxiety and improve my quality of life.""

### 6. **Consider Long-Term Solutions**
   - Xanax is typically prescribed for short-term use due to the risk of dependence and tolerance. If your anxiety is severe, your psychologist might suggest other treatments, such as therapy (e.g., CBT), other medications (e.g., SSRIs), or lifestyle changes.

### Should You Stay on 0.5 mg or Ask for an Increase?
   - If the 0.5 mg dose isn’t helping with your daily anxiety and you’re relying on 1 mg during attacks, it’s worth discussing this with your psychologist. However, increasing the dose of Xanax should be done cautiously, as it can lead to dependence and tolerance over time. Your psychologist may want to explore other options to address your anxiety more effectively.

Ultimately, the goal is to work collaboratively with your psychologist to find the best treatment plan for you. Be open to their suggestions and trust their expertise in guiding your care.",0.5044090747833252
2760,We've been dating for two months now. I have a heavy past that gets him angry. Does he have a right to penalize me for things I did before I met him?,"How is he penalizing you?Have you asked for his reasons for wanting to know about your heavy past?His answers may be very different than that he would like penalizing you.What you can do is explain how pressured you feel by his questions.Ideally, the two of you will become much closer by talking openly about your respective discomforts and wishes from the other.","It's important to recognize that everyone has a past, and it’s part of who you are today. However, your past does not define your worth, nor does it give anyone the right to penalize or judge you for it. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Your Past is Yours**: The things you did before meeting your partner are part of your personal journey. You are not obligated to justify or be penalized for them, as long as they don’t directly harm your current relationship.

2. **His Reaction is About Him**: If your partner is getting angry about your past, it may reflect his own insecurities, values, or expectations rather than something you’ve done wrong. It’s worth exploring why he feels this way and whether it’s a healthy dynamic for your relationship.

3. **Open Communication**: If your past is a sensitive topic, it’s important to have an honest and calm conversation about it. Share how his reactions make you feel and ask him to express his concerns without judgment or anger.

4. **Boundaries Are Key**: If your partner continues to penalize or hold your past against you, it’s important to set boundaries. Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect and understanding, not on punishment or control.

5. **Consider the Relationship’s Health**: If your partner’s anger or judgment persists, it may be a red flag. A loving and supportive partner should focus on who you are now and the relationship you’re building together, not on things that happened before you met.

Ultimately, you deserve to be with someone who respects and values you for who you are today, not someone who holds your past against you. If this issue continues to cause tension, it may be helpful to seek guidance from a counselor or therapist to navigate the situation together.",0.5039447546005249
3337,Every winter I find myself getting sad because of the weather.  How can I fight this?,"Sometimes its quite literally the lack of sunshine that can affect our mood - in these cases it can be worth experimenting with a sun lamp, to boost your dose of vitamin D, when the sun isn't naturally out. Also consider, what is it that the change in weather, changes in your life? If for example, when its sunny you are an outdoorsy, active person and when the weather changes, you're whole activity level changes along with it, you could explore how to get some of that activity replicated indoors in the winter months.","It’s not uncommon to feel down during the winter months, especially if you’re experiencing **Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)** or just a general dip in mood due to colder, darker days. Here are some practical strategies to help you fight winter sadness:

### 1. **Maximize Natural Light**
   - **Get outside during daylight hours:** Even if it’s cold, spending time outdoors during the day can boost your mood and exposure to natural light.
   - **Open curtains and blinds:** Let as much sunlight into your home as possible.
   - **Use a light therapy box:** A SAD lamp can mimic natural sunlight and help regulate your mood. Use it for 20–30 minutes each morning.

### 2. **Stay Active**
   - **Exercise regularly:** Physical activity releases endorphins, which can improve your mood. Try indoor workouts, yoga, or even dancing at home.
   - **Take winter-friendly walks:** Bundle up and enjoy the crisp air—it can be invigorating.

### 3. **Maintain a Routine**
   - **Stick to a consistent schedule:** Regular sleep, meals, and daily activities can provide stability and reduce feelings of lethargy.
   - **Set small, achievable goals:** This can help you stay motivated and give you a sense of accomplishment.

### 4. **Eat Mood-Boosting Foods**
   - **Focus on a balanced diet:** Include foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids (like salmon and walnuts), vitamin D (like fortified milk or eggs), and complex carbohydrates (like whole grains).
   - **Limit sugar and processed foods:** These can cause energy crashes and worsen mood swings.

### 5. **Stay Socially Connected**
   - **Plan regular meetups:** Even if it’s virtual, staying connected with friends and family can combat feelings of isolation.
   - **Join a group or class:** Consider activities like book clubs, art classes, or fitness groups to stay engaged.

### 6. **Practice Self-Care**
   - **Engage in activities you enjoy:** Whether it’s reading, crafting, or watching your favorite show, make time for things that bring you joy.
   - **Try mindfulness or meditation:** Apps like Calm or Headspace can help reduce stress and improve mental clarity.

### 7. **Consider Professional Help**
   - **Talk to a therapist:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be particularly effective for SAD.
   - **Consult a doctor:** If your symptoms are severe, they may recommend medication or other treatments.

### 8. **Embrace the Season**
   - **Find winter activities you enjoy:** Ice skating, skiing, or even cozying up with hot cocoa can help you appreciate the season.
   - **Decorate your space:** Adding warm, inviting elements like candles, blankets, or fairy lights can make your environment more comforting.

### 9. **Track Your Mood**
   - **Keep a journal:** Writing down your feelings can help you identify patterns and triggers, and track your progress over time.

### 10. **Be Patient with Yourself**
   - **Acknowledge your feelings:** It’s okay to feel down sometimes, and it’s important to treat yourself with kindness.

If your winter sadness persists or worsens, don’t hesitate to seek professional support. You’re not alone, and there are many resources available to help you feel better. 🌞",0.49755823612213135
2130,"I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental.

I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?","Hi. Good for you in planning ahead to do what's healthiest for your baby (and yourself). That's a great first step! It's also good that you are able to identify that it's not always a physical need that's driving the addiction.For the next steps, I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological (or mental) cravings are usually based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if you're consciously trying to quit, you'll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. Well, if I'm on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually I'll give in and eat it.You're going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. That's normal and, for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. That's what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it (""Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now.""), but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.I've suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they're going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.Best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby!","First of all, congratulations on your decision to quit smoking for your future baby! It’s a big step, and it’s completely normal to find it challenging. Smoking addiction is both physical and mental, so addressing both aspects is key. Here are some strategies to help you quit and stay smoke-free:

---

### **1. Understand the Mental Triggers**
- **Identify triggers**: Pay attention to when and why you crave cigarettes. Is it stress, boredom, social situations, or certain habits (e.g., after meals)? Once you know your triggers, you can plan how to avoid or manage them.
- **Replace the habit**: Find healthier alternatives to replace the act of smoking. For example, chew gum, sip water, or do deep breathing exercises when a craving hits.
- **Shift your mindset**: Remind yourself why you’re quitting—for your health, your baby’s health, and your future family. Visualize the benefits of being smoke-free.

---

### **2. Manage Physical Cravings**
- **Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)**: Consider using patches, gum, or lozenges to ease withdrawal symptoms. Talk to your doctor to find the safest option, especially if you’re planning to conceive soon.
- **Stay active**: Exercise can reduce cravings and improve your mood. Even a short walk can help distract you and release endorphins.
- **Stay hydrated**: Drinking water can help flush toxins from your body and reduce cravings.

---

### **3. Build a Support System**
- **Talk to loved ones**: Let your family and friends know you’re quitting. They can offer encouragement and hold you accountable.
- **Join a support group**: Many people find it helpful to connect with others who are also quitting. Look for local or online groups.
- **Professional help**: Consider counseling or therapy to address the psychological aspects of addiction. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be particularly effective.

---

### **4. Create a Smoke-Free Environment**
- **Remove temptations**: Throw away cigarettes, lighters, and ashtrays. Avoid places or situations where you might be tempted to smoke.
- **Change routines**: If you associate smoking with certain activities (e.g., coffee breaks), try changing your routine to break the association.

---

### **5. Practice Stress Management**
- **Relaxation techniques**: Try meditation, yoga, or deep breathing to manage stress without relying on cigarettes.
- **Hobbies**: Keep yourself busy with activities you enjoy to distract your mind from cravings.

---

### **6. Celebrate Small Wins**
- **Track your progress**: Use an app or journal to track how long you’ve been smoke-free. Celebrate milestones, like one day, one week, or one month.
- **Reward yourself**: Treat yourself to something special with the money you save from not buying cigarettes.

---

### **7. Be Patient and Kind to Yourself**
Quitting smoking is a journey, and it’s okay to have setbacks. If you slip up, don’t give up—learn from the experience and keep going. Every smoke-free day is a step toward a healthier you and a healthier baby.

2725,"I'm transgender, I know I am, but I've only told a few friends. I know I can't tell my family because of previous conversations we've had. They just wouldn't accept it.
My gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own. I need some strategies for dealing with it. What should I do?","Hello, and thank you for your question. I am so glad that you reached out for help. I know that the dysphoria can feel nearly impossible to handle, especially since you have limited support from people who accept who you are. You may already know some of these resources, but I am going to share a few. 1. The website www.letsqueerthingsup.com is a blog from a very good writer that I know. His name is Sam Dylan Finch, and he is transgender. He writes about mental health, transgender issues, and many other topics. I know he has frequently written about gender dysphoria and ways to manage it. You may want to check out his site and do a search on there. 2. The website www.everydayfeminism.com employs many transgender writers and several have written about gender dysphoria and have given ideas for managing it. If you search for gender dysphoria on their site, many articles pop up. It may be a good resource for you, especially if you ever feel lonely and start to forget that there are others out there who are like you and have your back. 3. I am not sure where you live, but there are counselors who specialize in affirmative therapy, which is what is recommended for folks who are part of the LGBTQ community. So, if you decide to see a counselor about the dysphoria, try to find one that specifically says they have been trained in the affirmative approach. In addition, feel free to ask questions of the counselor before agreeing to see them for counseling. An ethical counselor would have no problem answering them before having you come in. 4. If there are some LGBTQ resource centers in your area, try to reach out to them and see if there are support groups. Gaining more support from others would be helpful. Sometimes LGBTQ-friendly counselors leave their contact information for people in resource centers. 5. Finally, I know you have not mentioned being depressed or suicidal, but I also know that it is very common for people to consider suicide when they are struggling with dysphoria, dealing with transphobia, etc. If this ever happens to you, please call 911 or the Trans Lifeline. It's free at 877-565-8860. Visit their site at www.translifeline.org. I hope some of these ideas help. Feel free to send another message if you have a follow-up question.Be well....be YOU.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC ","First, I want to acknowledge how brave you are for recognizing and accepting your identity, even in the face of challenges. Dealing with gender dysphoria can be incredibly difficult, especially when you feel unsupported by loved ones. Here are some strategies that may help you navigate this:

### 1. **Build a Support System**
   - **Lean on trusted friends**: Since you’ve already shared with a few friends, continue to confide in them. Having people who validate and support you can make a huge difference.
   - **Find online communities**: There are many supportive online spaces for transgender individuals, such as Reddit’s r/asktransgender, Discord servers, or forums like Transgender Pulse. These can provide a sense of belonging and understanding.
   - **Seek LGBTQ+ organizations**: Look for local or national LGBTQ+ groups that offer resources, support groups, or counseling services.

### 2. **Express Your Gender Authentically**
   - **Small steps**: If it’s safe, experiment with clothing, hairstyles, or other forms of self-expression that align with your gender identity. Even small changes can help alleviate dysphoria.
   - **Create a private space**: If you’re unable to express yourself openly, create a space (like your room) where you can be yourself without fear of judgment.

### 3. **Practice Self-Care**
   - **Affirmations**: Remind yourself daily that your identity is valid and deserving of respect. Write down affirmations or keep a journal to process your feelings.
   - **Mindfulness and grounding techniques**: Practices like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help manage anxiety and dysphoria.
   - **Physical activity**: Exercise can be a great way to reconnect with your body in a positive way.

### 4. **Explore Professional Support**
   - **Therapy**: A therapist who specializes in gender identity can provide a safe space to explore your feelings and develop coping strategies. Look for LGBTQ+-affirming therapists in your area or online.
   - **Support groups**: Many organizations offer virtual or in-person support groups for transgender individuals. Sharing your experiences with others who understand can be incredibly validating.

### 5. **Educate Yourself**
   - Learn more about gender dysphoria and transgender experiences. Knowledge can empower you and help you feel less alone. Books, podcasts, and documentaries by transgender creators can be great resources.

### 6. **Plan for the Future**
   - **Set small goals**: Think about steps you can take to feel more aligned with your identity, whether it’s coming out to more people, starting hormone therapy, or exploring other aspects of transition.
   - **Consider your safety**: If coming out to your family isn’t an option right now, focus on building independence so you can create a life where you can be yourself.

### 7. **Remember You’re Not Alone**
   - Many transgender individuals face similar challenges, and while it’s hard, there is hope. You are not alone in this journey, and there are people and resources out there to support you.

If you ever feel overwhelmed or in crisis, reach out to a crisis hotline or support service like:
- **The Trevor Project**: 1-866-488-7386 or text “START” to 678-678 (U.S.)
- **Trans Lifeline**: 1-877-565-8860 (U.S. and Canada)

2149,"Whenever I leave my girlfriend I get panic attacks. I'm taking medications to control them, but I'm thinking of moving in with her since I get so anxious.","I’m sorry to hear that you are currently experiencing panic attacks. I hope that the medication you have been prescribed has provided you with some relief. Unfortunately, I don’t feel that moving in with your girlfriend would alleviate your anxiety. Although you may feel very anxious about leaving her, your body is reacting to this stressful event in your life in an unhealthy manner. You may be able to render this particular situation but it’s likely that you may experience another panic attack when an additional stressful event arises. Therefore, it is essential that you address the reason for why you are experiencing panic attacks in the first place followed by practicing coping mechanisms in the case that one would arise in the future.Talk therapy has shown to be effective with those affected by anxiety along with breathing exercises and yoga. A trained therapist will be able to assist you in finding the right stress reducing method so that you can reduce the chance of another attack occurring.I wish you the best of luck! It sounds like you are very happy in your relationship and I hope you are able to reduce your anxiety so that you are able to enjoy one another.","It’s clear that your girlfriend is a source of comfort and stability for you, and it’s understandable that you’re considering moving in together as a way to ease your anxiety. However, it’s important to approach this decision thoughtfully, especially when it comes to managing your mental health. Here are some things to consider:

### 1. **Understand the Root of Your Anxiety**
   - Are your panic attacks tied to separation anxiety, fear of abandonment, or something else? Understanding the underlying cause can help you address it more effectively.
   - If you haven’t already, working with a therapist to explore these feelings could provide valuable insights and coping strategies.

### 2. **Evaluate the Relationship**
   - Moving in together is a big step, and it’s important to ensure it’s the right decision for both of you. Are you both ready for this level of commitment? 
   - Consider whether your anxiety is the primary driver of this decision or if it aligns with your long-term goals and feelings for each other.

### 3. **Develop Coping Mechanisms**
   - While being with your girlfriend may temporarily ease your anxiety, it’s important to build skills to manage panic attacks independently. This could include mindfulness, breathing exercises, or grounding techniques.
   - Therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can be particularly helpful for managing panic attacks and reducing reliance on external sources of comfort.

### 4. **Communicate with Your Girlfriend**
   - Share your feelings with her in an open and honest way. Let her know how you’re feeling and why you’re considering this step.
   - Ensure that moving in together is something she’s equally excited about and not just a response to your anxiety.

### 5. **Take It Slow**
   - If you’re not ready to move in together, consider spending more time together in other ways (e.g., weekends, longer visits) to see how it feels.
   - Gradually increasing the time you spend apart can also help you build tolerance to separation and reduce panic attacks.

### 6. **Continue with Treatment**
   - Keep taking your medications as prescribed and stay in touch with your healthcare provider. If your symptoms persist or worsen, they may need to adjust your treatment plan.
   - Therapy can be a great complement to medication, helping you develop tools to manage anxiety in the long term.

### 7. **Consider the Long-Term**
   - Moving in together might provide short-term relief, but it’s important to address the root causes of your anxiety to ensure lasting improvement.
   - Think about how you’ll handle other challenges in the relationship or life stressors that may arise.

Ultimately, moving in together could be a positive step if it’s the right decision for both of you and aligns with your goals. However, it’s equally important to focus on building your own resilience and coping skills so that you can manage anxiety independently. If you’re unsure, talking to a therapist or counselor can help you navigate this decision in a way that supports both your mental health and your relationship.",0.4604496955871582

3252,"I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.
I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. While your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard. Talk to them during a non-emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as ""you NEVER listen,"" ""you ALWAYS say..."" and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with ""you"" try using ""I"" by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist, teacher, or school counselor if possible. Most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help.Best of luck to you.","I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way. It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of pain and loneliness, and it’s incredibly brave of you to share this. You’re dealing with some really heavy stuff, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. Let’s break this down and see if we can find ways to help you feel more supported and understood.

### 1. **Your Relationship with Your Parents**
It’s clear that you love your parents, but it’s also valid to feel hurt and frustrated when they don’t take you seriously or support you in the way you need. Generational gaps can make it hard for parents to understand their children’s experiences, especially when it comes to identity and mental health. Here are some thoughts:
   - **Communicate Your Feelings:** If you feel safe doing so, try expressing how their reactions make you feel. Use “I” statements, like “I feel hurt when my concerns are dismissed” or “I feel unsupported when I’m not believed.” This might help them see your perspective.
   - **Set Boundaries:** If their behavior is consistently harmful to your mental health, it’s okay to set boundaries. This might mean limiting what you share with them or seeking support elsewhere.
   - **Find Allies:** If coming out to them feels unsafe, that’s okay. You don’t owe anyone that part of yourself until you’re ready. Look for supportive communities, whether online or in person, where you can be your authentic self.

### 2. **Your Mental Health**
It’s amazing that you’ve fought depression and come out stronger. That’s a huge accomplishment! But stress and anxiety can still feel overwhelming. Here are some ideas to help manage them:
   - **Therapy or Counseling:** If you’re not already seeing a therapist, it might be helpful to talk to a professional who can provide tools to manage anxiety and stress.
   - **Self-Care:** Make time for activities that bring you joy or calm, whether it’s art, music, exercise, or just resting.
   - **Mindfulness Practices:** Techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or journaling can help ground you during moments of anxiety.

### 3. **Your Friendships**
It’s tough when it feels like your friends aren’t there for you in the way you need. Here’s how you might approach this:
   - **Communicate Your Needs:** Let your friends know how you’re feeling. They might not realize you’re struggling or that you need more support.
   - **Evaluate Relationships:** If some friendships feel one-sided, it’s okay to step back and focus on relationships that are more balanced and supportive.
   - **Expand Your Circle:** Consider joining clubs, groups, or online communities where you can meet people who share your interests or experiences.

### 4. **Feeling Like Your Childhood Was Taken**
This is such a deep and painful feeling, and it’s valid to grieve what you feel you’ve lost. But it’s not too late to reclaim joy and create moments that feel meaningful to you. Here’s how:
   - **Find Joy in Small Things:** What are some things you’ve always wanted to try or enjoy? Whether it’s a hobby, a trip, or just being silly, give yourself permission to have fun.
   - **Create New Memories:** Focus on building experiences that feel fulfilling and true to who you are now.
   - **Be Kind to Yourself:** It’s okay to feel sad about what you’ve missed, but try to remind yourself that you’re still growing and have so much life ahead of you.

### 5. **Building Trust**
It’s hard to feel like you can’t trust anyone, but trust can be rebuilt over time. Start small:
   - **Find Safe Spaces:** Look for communities or individuals who share your values and experiences. This could be through LGBTQ+ groups, mental health organizations, or even online forums.
   - **Take Your Time:** Trust doesn’t have to happen all at once. It’s okay to take things slow and see how people respond to you.

### 6. **You’re Not Alone**
Even when it feels like no one understands or cares, there are people out there who do. You’ve already shown so much strength by fighting depression and reaching out here. Keep going. You matter, and your feelings are valid.

If you ever feel like things are too much, please don’t hesitate to reach out to a trusted adult, counselor, or helpline. You deserve to be heard and supported. You’re not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to help. 💛",0.4438817501068115
926,"My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the ""straight and narrow"" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that I'm not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others.    His insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","You might ask your fiance about people who have let him down in the past; past hurts from parents, friends, people he has dated. If you are speaking about jealousy he may come from a divorced parent upbringing, may have seen parents cheat on one or the other, may have had partners cheat on him in the past.  He may have fears that you may go off the ""straight and narrow"" once you get married. Listen to any concerns with patience and understanding, avoid being defensive. I would highly encourage pre-marital counseling to explore these things and individual counseling for himself to work on fears and anxieties. If he refuses and things do not improve I would consider postponing the wedding, things will not get better once you get married, only magnified.  Finally show him Bible passages about forgiveness and worry and leaning on God with faith and hope for the future.    God bless.","I’m sorry you’re going through this.

   - **Create a safe space:** Let him know that you’re willing to listen without judgment and that you want to understand his feelings.
   - **Express your feelings:** Share how his insecurities are affecting you and the relationship. Use “I” statements, like “I feel hurt when my past is brought up because I want us to focus on our future together.”
   - **Reassure him:** Remind him of your love and commitment to him, and that your past doesn’t define your present or future.

### 2. **Address the Root of His Insecurities**
   - **Encourage self-reflection:** Gently ask him to explore why your past is so difficult for him to accept. Is it tied to his own insecurities, societal expectations, or fear of judgment?
   - **Acknowledge his feelings:** Validate his emotions without agreeing to them. For example, “I understand that my past is hard for you to accept, and I want us to work through this together.”

### 3. **Focus on Forgiveness and Grace**
   - **Remind him of your shared faith:** As Christians, you both believe in forgiveness, grace, and redemption. Share how your faith has helped you move forward and how it can guide your relationship.
   - **Pray together:** Invite him to pray with you for healing, understanding, and strength to move forward.

### 4. **Set Boundaries**
   - **Discuss what’s helpful and what’s harmful:** Let him know that repeatedly bringing up your past is damaging to the relationship and that you both need to focus on building trust and intimacy.
   - **Encourage professional help:** If his insecurities are deeply rooted, suggest couples counseling or individual therapy. A trained counselor can help him work through his feelings and provide tools for healthier communication.

### 5. **Build a Strong Foundation for the Future**
   - **Focus on the present:** Plan activities and conversations that strengthen your bond and remind him of the love and connection you share.
   - **Set shared goals:** Talk about your dreams for the future as a couple, like building a family, serving in your church, or growing spiritually together.

### 6. **Be Patient but Honest**
   - **Give him time:** Healing and growth take time, but let him know that you’re committed to working through this together.
   - **Be honest about your limits:** While you want to support him, it’s important to protect your own emotional well-being. If his insecurities continue to harm the relationship, you may need to reevaluate whether he’s ready for marriage.

### 7. **Encourage Self-Acceptance**
   - **Help him see his worth:** Remind him that his value isn’t tied to perfection or comparison but to who he is as a person and as a child of God.
   - **Celebrate your growth:** Highlight how far you’ve both come in your faith and relationship, and how your past experiences have shaped you into who you are today.

Remember, you can’t change his feelings or mindset—that’s something he has to work on himself. But by showing love, grace, and patience, you can create an environment where healing and growth are possible. If he’s unwilling to move forward, it may be a sign that he needs to address his insecurities before committing to marriage.",0.47814393043518066
864,My fiancé and I broke up. He cheated on me numerous times. I kept forgiving but questioning his every move. He got tired and left.,"Cheating on you shows a lack of commitment, in addition to the emotional hurt it creates.Probably you didn't actually forgive him because if you did, then you wouldn't have been asking questions of his every move.Maybe you were open to forgiving him.   In order for forgiveness to be effective, the person who has done the injuring must first show some understanding and empathy for the great pain the person caused in you.From what you write, your fiancé didn't seem to have much interest in earning back your trust or in empathizing with the way his cheating effected you.It is very likely his tiredness is also tiredness you feel, of having to watch him all the time.As uncomfortable as adjusting with the disappointment of him leaving you, the situation you describe sounds like it was unsatisfying for both of you.","I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a painful experience. Betrayal and heartbreak can be incredibly difficult to process, and it’s completely valid to feel hurt, confused, and even angry. Here are a few things to consider as you navigate this challenging time:

1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: It’s okay to grieve the relationship and the future you envisioned. Allow yourself to feel the emotions without judgment—whether it’s sadness, anger, or relief.

2. **Recognize Your Strength**: Forgiveness is a sign of strength, not weakness. You gave your relationship multiple chances, which shows your capacity for love and compassion. However, it’s important to remember that your worth is not defined by someone else’s actions.

3. **Focus on Self-Care**: Take time to nurture yourself. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family, engage in activities that bring you joy, and prioritize your mental and physical well-being.

4. **Reflect on the Relationship**: While it’s painful, this experience can help you better understand your boundaries and what you truly deserve in a partner. A healthy relationship is built on trust, respect, and mutual care—not constant doubt or betrayal.

5. **Let Go of Guilt**: It’s not your fault that he chose to cheat or leave. His actions were his own, and you deserve someone who values and respects you fully.

6. **Seek Support**: If you’re struggling to cope, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you process your emotions and rebuild your confidence.

7. **Look Forward**: While it may not feel like it now, this breakup could be the start of a new chapter in your life—one where you find happiness, peace, and a relationship that truly honors you.

Remember, healing takes time, and it’s okay to take things one day at a time. You are deserving of love and respect, and this experience, though painful, can lead to growth and a brighter future. You’re not alone, and better days are ahead. 💛",0.4600338935852051
2416,"My girlfriend and I have broken up and gotten back together numerous times in the past two years. We recently just broke up again last night on New Year’s Eve. When we break up, the very next day, she calls me and acts as if nothing has happened. She acts like everything is alright. This has been going on for two years. I do love her and care about her and her children a lot, but she seems really demanding as far as what she deserves from a man. She is always telling me that she deserves this and that from a man. It makes me feel like crap because I cannot give her everything that she wants. She told me one time that she wants a man who is going to be afraid to lose her. Is that a normal thing that women want, or should I just move on already? I am in my 30s and she is in her 40s.","Love is not enough to keep a relationship together.The people need to get along happily too.Let's start with knowing more about your happiness in being with your partner.The frequent break ups happen for a reason.  Try understanding more of why you go back together again.You state a few very clear reasons to not continue this relationship, such as ""feeling like crap"" and not liking that your girlfriend hopes her  partner will feel afraid to leave her.Trust your intuition telling you that these feelings matter.Sometimes men aren't sure whether following their instinct is a right action to take.It is.Also, hoping a partner will fear losing them, shows a wish to control a person.Control has nothing to do with love and trust, and these are basics of a relationship.Good luck!","It sounds like you’re in a very emotionally draining and cyclical relationship, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling conflicted. Let’s break this down and address your concerns:

### 1. **The Cycle of Breaking Up and Getting Back Together**
   - The pattern of breaking up and reconciling repeatedly can create emotional instability and prevent both of you from addressing the underlying issues in the relationship. It’s important to ask yourself why this keeps happening. Is it because of unresolved conflicts, fear of being alone, or a lack of clear boundaries? 
   - When she acts as if nothing happened the next day, it suggests she may not be taking the breakups seriously or may be avoiding the deeper issues. This can be unhealthy for both of you, as it prevents meaningful growth or resolution.

### 2. **Her Expectations and Demands**
   - It’s not uncommon for people to have expectations in a relationship, but her constant focus on what she “deserves” from a man can feel overwhelming and one-sided. A healthy relationship is about mutual respect, understanding, and compromise—not just one person’s demands.
   - Her statement that she wants a man who is “afraid to lose her” is concerning. This suggests she may be seeking validation or control rather than a partnership built on trust and equality. A healthy relationship should make you feel valued and secure, not inadequate or fearful.

### 3. **Your Feelings and Needs**
   - It’s clear that you care deeply for her and her children, but it’s equally important to prioritize your own emotional well-being. If her demands and behavior are making you feel “like crap,” it’s a sign that the relationship may not be meeting your needs.
   - Reflect on whether this relationship is truly fulfilling for you. Are you happy, or are you staying because you’re afraid of being alone or losing the connection you have with her children?

### 4. **Is This Normal?**
   - While some people may desire a partner who values them highly, wanting someone to be “afraid to lose them” is not a healthy or sustainable foundation for a relationship. It can lead to insecurity, manipulation, and power imbalances.
   - Healthy relationships are based on mutual respect, trust, and open communication—not fear or control.

### 5. **What Should You Do?**
   - **Set Boundaries:** If you decide to stay in the relationship, it’s crucial to set clear boundaries. Let her know that the cycle of breaking up and getting back together is not sustainable and that you both need to work on resolving issues rather than avoiding them.
   - **Communicate Your Feelings:** Share how her demands and expectations make you feel. A loving partner should be willing to listen and work with you to create a healthier dynamic.
   - **Evaluate the Relationship:** Take a step back and honestly assess whether this relationship is bringing you joy and fulfillment, or if it’s causing more stress than happiness.
   - **Consider Moving On:** If the relationship continues to feel one-sided, draining, or unhealthy, it may be time to consider moving on. Staying in a toxic cycle can prevent you from finding a relationship that truly meets your needs.

Ultimately, you deserve a relationship that makes you feel valued, respected, and loved—not one that leaves you feeling inadequate or stuck in a never-ending cycle. Take time to reflect on what you truly want and need, and don’t be afraid to make a decision that prioritizes your happiness and well-being.",0.48966526985168457
2620,"My coworkers are making false statements about me to the boss, saying I have mood swings. They have no proof to back it up. Can my employer make me see a therapist of their choice?","If this is a concern of a few coworkers, make sure it is not something they see but you don't admit to.  Employers can ""suggest"" or something ""stipulate"" in continued employment with them  for you to go to their Employment Assistance Provider (EAP) if they have noticed the same behavior and concerned of how it is effecting productivity or employee relationships.  No one wants to work in a environment which they consider hostile.  Employers can be held responsible if they do not take action.Couple of things you can do...Ask a coworker in which you trust and respect if what others are saying is true?Seek professional help from your primary care provider or counselor if mood swings do exist.      ","I'm not a lawyer, but I can provide general information on this topic. In most cases, your employer cannot force you to see a therapist unless it is a condition of your employment (e.g., in certain high-stress or sensitive roles) or if there is a legally mandated reason (e.g., following a workplace incident). However, employers can suggest or recommend counseling, especially if they believe it could help resolve workplace issues.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Company Policies**: Review your employee handbook or company policies to see if there are any provisions about mandatory counseling or therapy. Some companies may have wellness programs or policies that encourage counseling, but these are typically voluntary.

2. **Discrimination and Harassment**: If your coworkers are spreading false statements about you, this could potentially be considered workplace harassment or defamation. Document the incidents and consider discussing the situation with HR to address the behavior.

3. **Medical Privacy**: Your employer generally cannot require you to disclose medical or mental health information unless it directly impacts your ability to perform your job or poses a safety risk. They also cannot mandate that you see a specific therapist unless it is part of a legally justified process (e.g., a fitness-for-duty evaluation).

4. **Retaliation**: If you feel your coworkers' actions are retaliatory or discriminatory, you may have legal protections under employment laws. Consult with an employment attorney or your local labor board for guidance.

5. **Voluntary Counseling**: If your employer suggests therapy, you can choose to participate voluntarily or decline. If you feel pressured, you can ask for clarification on whether it is mandatory and the reasons behind the request.

If you're concerned about the situation, it may be helpful to consult an employment lawyer or a trusted HR professional to understand your rights and options.",0.4195321798324585
1602,"My ex-boyfriend and I have been back and forth for over a year now. He's in his late 20s, divorced for like five years now with two kids. He has a lot of narcissistic behaviors. He lies and cheats, but I love him. I've tried to date other people, but I always go back to him.","There are a lot of pieces to the decision of whether to stay or leave. Can you have open conversations about your concerns? Is he able to listen to that? I'm not sure how you know for sure that he lies and cheats, but does he recognize these things as problems? Which part of you is bigger: the part of you that wants to stay or the part of you that wants to leave? Can you consider what you want, wish for, and desire while also considering the same for him? Can he do that for you?","It sounds like you're in a very challenging and emotionally draining situation. Being in a relationship with someone who exhibits narcissistic behaviors, lies, and cheats can take a significant toll on your mental and emotional well-being. Here are some steps to consider as you navigate this difficult situation:

### 1. **Acknowledge the Reality of the Situation**
   - **Recognize the Patterns:** It’s important to acknowledge the recurring patterns in your relationship, such as the lying, cheating, and emotional manipulation. These behaviors are not likely to change unless he actively seeks help and makes a concerted effort to change.
   - **Understand the Impact:** Reflect on how this relationship is affecting you. Are you feeling drained, insecure, or unhappy more often than not? Your well-being should be a priority.

### 2. **Set Boundaries**
   - **Define Your Limits:** Decide what behaviors you are no longer willing to tolerate. Setting clear boundaries can help protect your emotional health.
   - **Stick to Your Boundaries:** It’s one thing to set boundaries, but it’s another to enforce them. Be firm in your decisions, even if it’s difficult.

### 3. **Focus on Self-Love and Self-Care**
   - **Prioritize Yourself:** Invest time in activities that make you happy and help you feel fulfilled. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who uplift you.
   - **Seek Professional Help:** Consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through your feelings and develop strategies for moving forward.

### 4. **Consider the Long-Term**
   - **Evaluate the Future:** Think about what you want in a long-term relationship. Does this relationship align with your values and goals? Are you willing to accept these behaviors indefinitely?
   - **Think About Your Needs:** A healthy relationship should bring out the best in you and make you feel valued and respected. Consider whether this relationship is meeting your needs.

### 5. **Break the Cycle**
   - **Create Distance:** If possible, create physical and emotional distance from your ex. This can help you gain clarity and reduce the pull to go back to him.
   - **Focus on Moving Forward:** Instead of looking back, focus on building a future that doesn’t include toxic relationships. This might involve exploring new hobbies, meeting new people, or even moving to a new environment.

### 6. **Seek Support**
   - **Lean on Friends and Family:** Share your feelings with trusted friends or family members who can offer support and perspective.
   - **Join a Support Group:** Sometimes, talking to others who have been in similar situations can be incredibly validating and helpful.

### 7. **Be Patient with Yourself**
   - **Allow Yourself Time:** Healing from a toxic relationship takes time. Be patient with yourself as you work through your emotions and navigate the process of letting go.
   - **Forgive Yourself:** It’s easy to be hard on yourself for staying in a difficult relationship, but it’s important to remember that you’re doing the best you can. Forgive yourself for any perceived mistakes and focus on growth.

Remember, you deserve a relationship that is healthy, respectful, and fulfilling. It’s okay to walk away from something that no longer serves you, even if it’s difficult.",0.4974812865257263
2318,"Whenever I don't tell my friends or anyone what I did or stuff that's not really important, I feel terrible, like there’s a hole in my stomach. It only goes away when I hurt myself.","Hi Kansas, I feel strongly that the help of a professional therapist is important here. Feelings are never wrong, but it can help to understand where they come from and talk to someone who can teach you healthy ways to cope. Self-harm is not the answer to managing those emotions you feel in your stomach. Although I'm glad you said something here, a professional would need to spend some time with you and get a deep understanding of your life in order to help you sort all these reactions out effectively. I hope you reach out to someone soon. ","I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're going through a lot of emotional pain, and I want you to know that you're not alone. What you're describing—feeling a hole in your stomach and the urge to hurt yourself—suggests that you might be struggling with intense feelings of guilt, shame, or anxiety. These emotions can be overwhelming, and it’s important to address them in a way that’s safe and healthy.

Here are a few things that might help:

### 1. **Understand the Root of the Feeling**
   - Ask yourself: *Why do I feel like I need to share everything?* Is it because you feel like you’re not enough on your own, or because you’re afraid of being judged? Understanding where these feelings come from can help you work through them.

### 2. **Practice Self-Compassion**
   - Remind yourself that it’s okay to keep some things private. You don’t owe anyone every detail of your life. You’re allowed to have boundaries, and that doesn’t make you a bad person.

### 3. **Find Alternatives to Self-Harm**
   - When you feel the urge to hurt yourself, try to replace that behavior with something else. For example:
     - Write down your feelings in a journal.
     - Squeeze an ice cube or hold onto something cold to distract yourself.
     - Use a stress ball or fidget toy to release tension.
     - Take a walk, listen to music, or do something creative.

### 4. **Talk to Someone You Trust**
   - Sharing your feelings with someone you trust can help lighten the emotional load. It doesn’t have to be about everything you’ve done—just talking about how you’re feeling can make a difference.

### 5. **Seek Professional Help**
   - If these feelings persist, it might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor. They can help you explore these emotions and develop healthier coping mechanisms.

### 6. **Be Patient with Yourself**
   - Healing takes time, and it’s okay to have setbacks. You’re doing the best you can, and that’s enough.

### 7. **Create a Safety Plan**
   - If you’re struggling with self-harm, it’s important to have a plan in place for when you feel overwhelmed. This might include a list of people to call, activities to distract yourself, or a place to go where you feel safe.

You deserve to feel better, and there are people who care about you and want to help. Please consider reaching out to someone—whether it’s a friend, family member, or professional—so you don’t have to carry this alone.

1178,"My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board—no more drinking every night.
 The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.  I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. I just feel like I'm so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty. He is a good husband in every other regard.","As exasperated as you feel, and as obvious it is to you that your husband cares more about drinking than being honest with you, changing this is up to him.Does he care that you're upset with him for drinking more than he can handle?Does he care about you more than drinking?Living with an alcoholic, which is how his behavior sounds, is lonely and frustrating.Concentrate on what you like about him as he is now with his drinking.Your happiness matters.  His ignoring of what you're talking about, doesn't mean your requests are unreasonable.Be prepared to learn to live with and accept how he behaves, or not.Avoid the expectation that you can convince him to change.People change only when they realize their life can improve by changing.  He doesn't sound like this, at least now.","You’re not overreacting. What you’re feeling is valid and understandable. Alcohol addiction is a complex issue, and it’s clear that you care deeply about your husband and your relationship. It’s natural to feel hurt and frustrated when trust is broken, especially when it involves a pattern of behavior that has caused concern in the past.

Here are a few things to consider as you navigate this situation:

1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: It’s okay to feel hurt, disappointed, or even angry. You’ve been honest with him about your concerns, and it’s reasonable to expect honesty in return. Your feelings are valid, and it’s important to process them.

2. **Recognize the Complexity of Addiction**: Alcohol addiction is often accompanied by denial, shame, and defensiveness. Your husband’s lying and snapping may be a reflection of his own struggle rather than a lack of care for you. This doesn’t excuse the behavior, but it can help you approach the situation with empathy.

3. **Choose the Right Time to Talk**: Confronting someone when they’re intoxicated or passed out is unlikely to lead to a productive conversation. Wait for a calm moment when you’re both sober and composed to discuss your concerns. Focus on expressing how his behavior is affecting you and your relationship rather than accusing or blaming him.

4. **Set Boundaries**: It’s important to establish clear boundaries that protect your well-being. For example, you might decide that you’re not okay with him drinking every night or lying about it. Communicate these boundaries calmly and firmly, and be prepared to enforce them.

5. **Encourage Professional Help**: If your husband’s drinking is becoming a recurring issue, it may be time to suggest seeking professional help. This could include therapy, counseling, or support groups like Alcoholics Anonymous. Approach this suggestion with compassion and emphasize that you’re offering support, not judgment.

6. **Take Care of Yourself**: Dealing with a loved one’s addiction can be emotionally draining. Make sure you’re prioritizing your own mental and emotional health. Consider seeking support for yourself, whether through therapy, support groups like Al-Anon, or trusted friends and family.

7. **Evaluate the Relationship**: While your husband may be a good partner in other ways, his behavior around alcohol is impacting your trust and well-being. Reflect on whether this is a pattern you’re willing to continue navigating and what steps you need to take to feel secure and respected in the relationship.

Ultimately, addressing this issue will require open communication, mutual understanding, and potentially outside support. It’s not easy, but taking these steps can help you both move toward a healthier and more honest relationship.",0.4651196599006653
2164,I have this weird fetish that I'm afraid to open up about it. What should I do?,"This is difficult to answer because you don’t tell us what the fetish is.  I do understand that this is something that is bothering you though. The first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not.  If this is illegal to engage in, then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urges.However, if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd, a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings.  You may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of.  You may find other people have the same interest as you.  Find a therapist that you can trust and tell them.  Don’t hold back with your therapist.  Trust me, they have heard and seen it all by now, and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress, or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are.  There is no need to suffer with this alone. ","It's completely normal to feel hesitant or anxious about opening up about a fetish, especially if it feels unusual or taboo. Here are some steps to consider as you navigate this:

1. **Self-Acceptance**: First, recognize that having a fetish is a part of your sexuality, and it’s okay to have unique desires. Many people have fetishes, and they vary widely. Accepting yourself is the first step toward feeling more comfortable.

2. **Educate Yourself**: Learn more about your fetish. Understanding it better can help you feel more confident and less ashamed. There are many resources online, including forums, articles, and books, that can provide information and normalize your feelings.

3. **Find a Safe Space**: If you want to share your fetish with someone, choose a safe and non-judgmental environment. This could be with a trusted partner, a close friend, or a therapist who specializes in sexuality. Make sure the person is open-minded and supportive.

4. **Consider Therapy**: If your fetish is causing you distress or interfering with your life, talking to a therapist, especially one who specializes in sexual health, can be incredibly helpful. They can provide a non-judgmental space to explore your feelings and offer guidance.

5. **Online Communities**: There are many online communities and forums where people discuss their fetishes openly. Joining one of these can help you feel less alone and provide a sense of belonging. Just be cautious about privacy and safety.

6. **Communicate with a Partner**: If you’re in a relationship and want to share your fetish with your partner, approach the conversation with care. Start by discussing your sexual preferences in general and gradually introduce your fetish. Emphasize that it’s something you’d like to explore together, but only if they’re comfortable.

7. **Take Your Time**: There’s no rush to share your fetish with others. Take the time you need to feel comfortable and confident. You don’t have to disclose anything until you’re ready.

8. **Respect Boundaries**: It’s important to remember that not everyone will share or understand your fetish, and that’s okay. Respect others’ boundaries and consent, and don’t pressure anyone into participating in something they’re not comfortable with.

Remember, your sexuality is a personal and unique part of who you are. It’s okay to have desires that are different from others, and there’s no need to feel ashamed. Taking small steps toward understanding and accepting your fetish can help you feel more at ease with it over time.",0.48958516120910645
1171,I'm 15 and my girlfriend is 14. Am I a pedophile because I'm attracted to her and she's under 18?,"No. You are not a pedophile. You are both under the appropriate age where it would be seen so. Your both only a year a part so this shouldn't a worry to you. Like Frank said below, Pedophelia is a problem that won't apply to this situation.","No, you are not a pedophile. The term ""pedophile"" refers to an adult who is sexually attracted to prepubescent children, typically under the age of 13. In your case, you and your girlfriend are both teenagers, and it's normal for people your age to develop romantic and physical attractions to peers who are close in age.

It's important to understand that relationships at your age should be based on mutual respect, consent, and healthy boundaries. Since you're both minors, it's also important to be aware of the laws in your area regarding relationships between people under the age of 18. In many places, relationships between teenagers who are close in age are considered legal and socially acceptable.

If you have any concerns or questions about your relationship, it might be helpful to talk to a trusted adult, counselor, or healthcare professional who can provide guidance and support.",0.4271754026412964
70,"I have been feeling more and more down for over a month. I have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks, but they are almost never triggered by something that I know of.","Answers about our inner lives are most successfully reached from a sense of feeling grounded in oneself.First step is to accept your nervousness and restless sleep.  As often as possible, sleep during daytimes in order for your body to catch up on its need for rest.Accept too about feeling down.  It is normal to feel down once in a while.  From this place of self-acceptance, trust any answers which come up to your mind.  Often answers about complicated topics come in small pieces, not all at once as a whole unit.Also, your description about panic attacks is also completely normal.   They often arise unrelated to particular conditions at a given moment.  They are a healthy symptom your body is trying to expel bad feelings and does this by having the anxiety erupt at times.So, self-acceptance, tolerance of being on a process of clearing out worn out emotional clutter, and sleep at odd times if possible, are all ways to stabilize yourself, which will also feel calm and good!","I’m really sorry to hear you’re feeling this way, but I’m glad you’re reaching out. What you’re describing—persistent feelings of being down, trouble sleeping, and panic attacks—can be really overwhelming, especially when they seem to come out of nowhere. It’s important to take these feelings seriously and consider seeking support to help you navigate this.

Here are a few steps you might consider:

### 1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**
   - It’s okay to feel this way, and it’s important to recognize that what you’re experiencing is valid. Anxiety and depression can manifest in physical and emotional ways, even without a clear trigger.

### 2. **Reach Out to a Professional**
   - A mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, can help you explore what might be contributing to these feelings and provide strategies to manage them. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), for example, is often effective for both anxiety and depression.
   - If the panic attacks are frequent and disruptive, a psychiatrist might be able to assess whether medication could help.

### 3. **Practice Grounding Techniques**
   - During a panic attack, grounding techniques can help bring you back to the present moment. For example:
     - **5-4-3-2-1 Technique**: Identify 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
     - **Deep Breathing**: Focus on slow, deep breaths—inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, exhale for 6 counts.

### 4. **Establish a Sleep Routine**
   - Sleep disturbances can exacerbate anxiety and depression. Try to create a calming bedtime routine:
     - Avoid screens an hour before bed.
     - Practice relaxation techniques like meditation or gentle stretching.
     - Keep your sleep environment cool, dark, and quiet.

### 5. **Take Care of Your Physical Health**
   - Regular exercise, even light activities like walking, can help reduce anxiety and improve mood.
   - Eating balanced meals and staying hydrated can also have a positive impact on your mental health.

### 6. **Lean on Your Support System**

1606,"I am currently suffering from erectile dysfunction and have tried Viagra, Cialis, etc. Nothing seemed to work. My girlfriend of 3 years is very sexually frustrated. I told her that it is okay for her to have sex with other men. Is that really okay?","Hi, First and foremost, I want to acknowledge your efforts to gain (your) ideal erectile function. If the medications are not working and you have taken them as prescribed, I would encourage you to seek the help of a sex therapist as the dysfunction may be due to a psychological and/or relational issue rather than a physical/medical one. As for your question, only you can answer this. Is it OK? Are you OK with her sleeping with others? Have you thought through what this may look like, feel like, become for you and her? Opening up a relationship is a choice only the people in the relationship can answer. Even then, the answer may change at any point by either of you. I encourage you to also determine what the intention is underneath your telling your girlfriend she could sleep with others. Be clear with the intention and then together have continuous conversations about the expectations of opening up (i.e.: are there any kinds of sex that is off limits, areas of the body where touch or intimacy is not allowed, are uses of safer sex required or not, do you want to know the details or not, so forth). An excellent resource would be the book ""Opening Up"" by Tristan Taormino. I wish you the best of luck!Dr. Lily Zehner, MFT-C","I'm sorry to hear you're going through this challenging situation. Erectile dysfunction (ED) can be deeply frustrating and emotionally difficult, both for you and your partner. It’s commendable that you’re open to discussing solutions, but introducing the idea of your girlfriend having sex with other men is a complex decision that requires careful thought and communication.

Here are some key considerations:

1. **Emotional Impact**: Opening up your relationship in this way can have significant emotional consequences for both of you. It’s important to consider whether this is something you both truly want and whether it aligns with your values and relationship goals.

2. **Communication**: Have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you’re feeling and what you’re proposing. Make sure she understands your reasoning and that you both discuss your feelings, boundaries, and expectations.

3. **Underlying Causes of ED**: If medications like Viagra and Cialis aren’t working, it’s worth exploring other potential causes of ED, such as psychological factors (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression), hormonal imbalances, or other medical conditions. Consulting a healthcare professional, such as a urologist or therapist, could help identify and address the root cause.

4. **Alternative Solutions**: There are other treatments for ED, including lifestyle changes (e.g., exercise, diet, quitting smoking), therapy (e.g., couples therapy or sex therapy), and alternative medications or devices. A healthcare provider can guide you through these options.

5. **Relationship Dynamics**: Consider how this decision might affect your relationship long-term. Opening a relationship can work for some couples, but it requires a strong foundation of trust, communication, and mutual understanding.

Ultimately, the decision is deeply personal and should be made with care and mutual consent. If you’re unsure, seeking guidance from a therapist or counselor who specializes in sexual health or relationships could help you both navigate this situation in a way that strengthens your bond rather than creating further strain.

Take care of yourself, and remember that you’re not alone—many people face similar challenges, and there are resources and professionals who can help.",0.43993592262268066
402,"I have these dreams of men, and they always seem to try to hurt me. It's gotten so bad that I first wake at 4:30, then 4:45, and finally stay awake by 6:00. I'm always the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake. I hate falling asleep. The longest I've went without sleep is three days.","The good news about your dreams is that your fears are right at the surface of your mind so you can study them and release some of the harm from the terrifying experiences you had which created these bad memories in the first place.The bad news is the feelings themselves are sickening.Probably a therapist would be very helpful for guiding you to unfold these uneasy feelings and their source.This type of deep work is easier with emotional support from someone.  A therapist can give you this plus is knowledgeable about dynamics of someone having been emotionally harmed by another.Or, read a lot online and find out which articles resonate with your emotions.Luckily people are willing to express personal stories of recuperating a sense of peace and safety after being violated by someone.","I’m so sorry you’re going through this. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of distress, both emotionally and physically, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling this way. Recurring nightmares and sleep disruptions can be incredibly draining and overwhelming, especially when they feel so real and threatening.

Here are a few things to consider that might help:

### 1. **Understanding the Dreams**
   - Recurring dreams, especially those involving fear or harm, often reflect unresolved stress, anxiety, or trauma. They could be your mind’s way of processing something that’s bothering you, even if you’re not consciously aware of it.
   - Keeping a dream journal might help you identify patterns or triggers. Writing down the details of the dreams can also help you process them and reduce their intensity over time.

### 2. **Addressing Sleep Disruptions**
   - The fact that you’re waking up multiple times and struggling to stay asleep suggests that your sleep cycle is being severely disrupted. This could be due to anxiety, stress, or even a sleep disorder like insomnia.
   - Try to establish a calming bedtime routine to signal to your body that it’s time to wind down. This could include activities like reading, listening to soothing music, or practicing relaxation techniques.

### 3. **Managing Anxiety**
   - If the dreams are causing you to dread sleep, it’s likely that anxiety is playing a big role. Techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation can help calm your mind before bed.
   - If you’re open to it, therapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia or trauma-focused therapy) could be incredibly helpful in addressing the root causes of these dreams and improving your sleep.

### 4. **Seeking Professional Help**
   - If this has been going on for a while and is significantly impacting your life, it might be worth talking to a doctor or mental health professional. They can help rule out underlying medical or psychological issues and provide tailored support.
   - In some cases, medication or short-term sleep aids might be recommended to help break the cycle of sleeplessness and give your body a chance to recover.

### 5. **Self-Care and Support**
   - Be gentle with yourself. Sleep deprivation can take a toll on your mood, energy, and overall well-being. Prioritize self-care, even if it’s small things like staying hydrated, eating nourishing foods, or spending time with supportive people.
   - Don’t hesitate to lean on friends, family, or support groups. You don’t have to go through this alone.

### 6. **Breaking the Cycle**
   - Going without sleep for three days is extreme and can have serious effects on your physical and mental health. If you find yourself in that situation again, please consider reaching out for immediate help. Sleep is essential for your body and mind to function properly.

You’re not alone in this, and there are ways to work through it. It might take time, but with the right support and strategies, you can find relief and reclaim your sleep. Let me know if you’d like more specific resources or guidance—I’m here to help.",0.44408029317855835

2323,"I'm in a long-distance relationship with my ideal man, but I'm not as attracted to him as I should be. Everything else is perfect about him, but I find myself lusting over more attractive men. The next step is marriage, but I want to marry someone who I can wake up to and fall in love with all over again. However, I also don't want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust. Am I asking for too much in the ""perfect guy""? Is there such a thing? Am I truly in love?","Attraction is important but sometimes over-rated. I'm curious about your comment that you are not as attracted as you ""should be"" - What is your measuring stick is for what you are supposed to feel in terms of attraction in a relationship? Do you want to be sexually intimate? Do you enjoy having sex with him? Are you satisfied with your sexual relationship when you are with him? The fact that there is lust for other more attractive men does not necessarily mean anything. There will always be attractive men and more attractive men than your partner and these attractive men will be even more appealing when you are in a long-distance relationship far from the arms of your partner. Loving someone does not mean that you stop being a sexual being who no longer notices and desires attractive men. Attraction results from a number of factors beyond appearance - including the degree to which you feel emotionally open, safe, and connected and how in tune you are with each other's bodies. It sounds like you think very highly of this man ""everything else is perfect about him"". Maybe it is worth spending some more time together in the same place if that is possible before deciding on marriage or that you are not truly in love. ","These are deeply personal and complex questions, and it’s commendable that you’re taking the time to reflect on them. Let’s break this down step by step:

### 1. **Are You Asking for Too Much in the ""Perfect Guy""?**
   There’s no such thing as a ""perfect"" person—everyone has flaws, and every relationship requires compromise. However, it’s not unreasonable to want to feel both emotionally *and* physically attracted to your partner. Physical attraction and chemistry are important components of a romantic relationship, and they contribute to long-term satisfaction and intimacy.

   That said, attraction can evolve over time. Sometimes, emotional connection and shared values deepen physical attraction, even if it wasn’t instant or overwhelming at first. The key is to assess whether your lack of attraction is a temporary hurdle or a fundamental incompatibility.

### 2. **Is There Such a Thing as the ""Perfect Guy""?**
   No, because perfection is subjective and unattainable. What matters is finding someone who aligns with your core values, treats you well, and makes you feel loved and supported. While physical attraction is important, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. A truly fulfilling relationship is built on trust, communication, shared goals, and mutual respect.

   If your partner checks all these boxes but you’re still unsure about the physical aspect, it’s worth examining whether your expectations are realistic or influenced by societal or external pressures.

### 3. **Are You Truly in Love?**
   Love is a combination of emotional intimacy, commitment, and passion. If you feel deeply connected to your partner emotionally and value the relationship, that’s a strong foundation. However, if you’re consistently drawn to others physically and feel like something is missing, it’s worth exploring why.

   Ask yourself:
   - Do you feel excited about the future with him?
   - Do you miss him when you’re apart, not just out of habit but because you genuinely want to be with him?
   - Do you feel fulfilled in the relationship, or do you often fantasize about being with someone else?

   If you’re feeling more ambivalent than passionate, it may be a sign that you’re not fully in love—or that you’re not ready to commit to marriage.

### 4. **What Should You Do?**
   - **Reflect on Your Priorities:** What matters most to you in a life partner? Is physical attraction a dealbreaker, or can you see it growing over time?
   - **Communicate Openly:** If you’re comfortable, have an honest conversation with your partner about your feelings. This doesn’t mean confessing your attraction to others, but rather discussing your concerns about the relationship and your readiness for marriage.
   - **Give It Time:** If everything else in the relationship is great, consider giving yourself more time to see if your feelings deepen. Long-distance relationships can sometimes make it harder to gauge physical chemistry, so spending more time together in person might help.
   - **Seek Guidance:** Talking to a therapist or counselor can help you gain clarity about your feelings and make a decision that aligns with your values and desires.

### 5. **Final Thoughts**
   It’s normal to have doubts, especially when facing a major life decision like marriage. What’s important is being honest with yourself about what you truly want and need in a relationship. If you’re not feeling fully satisfied or committed, it’s better to address those feelings now rather than later.

   Remember, there’s no ""right"" or ""wrong"" answer—only what’s right for you. Trust your instincts, and don’t rush into a decision until you feel confident and at peace with it.",0.39994630217552185
811,How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,"This can be a very challenging decision, and it may take time for you to sort through all of your feelings about the relationship and its possible end. Therapy can help you have a space to be completely honest with yourself about your relationship as you grapple with your decision of whether to remain with your boyfriend. Your therapist can ask questions to guide you in uncovering your true feelings about whether this is the right relationship for you, and he or she can support you in whatever decision you come to.","Deciding whether to end a relationship is a deeply personal and often difficult decision. Here are some steps and considerations to help you reflect on your situation and make a thoughtful choice:

### 1. **Assess Your Feelings**
   - Are you consistently unhappy or unfulfilled in the relationship?
   - Do you feel respected, valued, and supported by your partner?
   - Are you still emotionally invested in the relationship, or have you grown distant?

### 2. **Evaluate the Relationship Dynamics**
   - Is there mutual trust, communication, and understanding?
   - Are conflicts resolved in a healthy and constructive way, or do they escalate into resentment?
   - Do you share similar values, goals, and visions for the future?

### 3. **Consider the Effort**
   - Are both of you putting in equal effort to maintain and grow the relationship?
   - Have you tried addressing issues or seeking external help (e.g., couples therapy)?
   - Do you feel like you’re the only one working to keep the relationship alive?

### 4. **Reflect on Your Needs**
   - Are your emotional, physical, and mental needs being met?
   - Do you feel like you’re compromising too much of yourself or your happiness?
   - Are you able to be your authentic self in the relationship?

### 5. **Think About the Future**
   - Can you envision a future with this person that makes you feel excited and hopeful?
   - Are there deal-breakers (e.g., incompatible life goals, lack of commitment) that you can’t overlook?
   - Would staying in the relationship prevent you from growing or pursuing your own happiness?

### 6. **Trust Your Intuition**
   - Deep down, do you feel like the relationship is right for you?
   - Are you staying out of fear, guilt, or habit, or because you genuinely want to be with this person?

### 7. **Seek Perspective**
   - Talk to trusted friends or family members who know you well and can offer objective advice.
   - Consider speaking with a therapist or counselor to process your feelings and gain clarity.

### 8. **Make a Decision**
   - If you decide to stay, commit to working on the relationship and addressing any issues together.
   - If you decide to leave, approach the conversation with kindness and honesty, and prioritize your well-being.

### Questions to Ask Yourself:
   - Am I better off with or without this person in my life?
   - Is this relationship helping me grow, or is it holding me back?
   - Can the issues in the relationship be resolved, or are they fundamental incompatibilities?

Remember, there’s no “right” or “wrong” decision—only what’s best for you. Take your time, be honest with yourself, and trust that you’ll make the choice that aligns with your happiness and well-being.",0.5164860486984253
1377,"My older brother (in his 60s) started dating a lady with Asperger's. She is hyper-sexual and flirty. She does not understand boundaries. They’ve been dating for a few months, and she's talking marriage. Another sibling and his wife have met her, and they have said she is never invited back. My brother always picks similar ladies. Do we speak honestly and risk losing a relationship?","If you and your brother are open w each other and respect each other’s opinions then there is little risk your relationship with him will end.If there already is strong animosity, mistrust, dislike between both of you then there is more chance he will not seriously consider your advice.For your own peace of mind, say whatever you feel must be said to him.The person you’ll need to live with is yourself so do what you believe is needed for you to feel good about saying what’s necessary.Even if he never follows through with your advice then you’ll still know you tried your best to advise.","This is a delicate situation that requires careful consideration and empathy. Here are some steps to approach it thoughtfully:

1. **Understand the Context**: Recognize that your brother’s partner has Asperger’s, which may influence her behavior, including her hyper-sexuality and difficulty with boundaries. This doesn’t excuse inappropriate actions, but it provides context for understanding her challenges.

2. **Assess Your Brother’s Patterns**: You mention your brother tends to pick similar partners. Reflect on whether this pattern reflects his needs, desires, or unresolved issues. Understanding this may help you approach the conversation with more compassion.

3. **Choose the Right Time and Tone**: If you decide to speak with your brother, do so privately and with kindness. Avoid judgmental language and focus on expressing concern for his well-being and happiness.

4. **Be Honest but Tactful**: Share your observations gently. For example, you might say, “I’ve noticed some behaviors that seem to make others uncomfortable, and I’m concerned about how this might affect your relationship in the long term.”

5. **Focus on Boundaries**: Discuss the importance of healthy boundaries in relationships. You could say, “It’s important for both partners to feel respected and comfortable. Have you talked about boundaries with her?”

6. **Encourage Professional Support**: Suggest that your brother and his partner consider counseling or therapy, both individually and as a couple. A professional can help them navigate challenges and build a healthier relationship.

7. **Respect His Autonomy**: Ultimately, your brother’s choices are his own. Even if you disagree with his decisions, it’s important to respect his autonomy and let him know you’ll support him regardless.

8. **Prepare for Possible Outcomes**: Understand that your brother may react defensively or distance himself temporarily. Be patient and give him space to process the conversation.

9. **Stay Connected**: Even if the conversation is difficult, maintain open lines of communication. Let your brother know you’re there for him, no matter what.

10. **Consider Family Dynamics**: If other family members have strong feelings, encourage them to approach the situation with the same care and compassion.

The goal is to express your concerns without alienating your brother. While honesty is important, it’s equally crucial to prioritize your relationship with him and approach the conversation with love and understanding.",0.4274477958679199
1577,"We’ve been together almost three years. We argue and he ends it by telling me he doesn’t love me. It's hurtful because I am all about resolving the problem, and he dwells on the issue even if I drop what he's done and just swallow my pride and say I am sorry. How can this be resolved? We have kids, and I don't want a broken family because we can't communicate.","You can't fix this by yourself, but I applaud you for trying. One person working hard in a relationship can make things better for a while., but in the long haul you need two people giving some effort. I'm reading between your lines here and I wonder if your need to keep the family together is getting you to apologize when you've done nothing wrong and ignore things you've felt hurt by. I sense that you're doing all the work...that it's not balanced. I have worked with many couples and I've learned never to underestimate what kind of change is possible; anything is possible. But in order for change in a couple to occur, you need two people who are both willing to own their choices and behaviours, and who have empathy. Your boyfriend doesn't appear to have these components; he pushes you away and blames you when he's done something hurtful.Can you be honest with yourself about what's happening? I encourage you to sit down with a trusted friend or therapist and look at what you have here and what your options are. I wish you well.","I’m so sorry you’re going through this—it sounds incredibly painful and frustrating, especially when you’re trying to prioritize your family and resolve conflicts. Relationships can be challenging, especially when communication breaks down, but there are steps you can take to address this situation. Here’s how you might approach it:

### 1. **Reflect on the Pattern**
   - Take a step back and try to identify the recurring issues in your arguments. Is there a specific trigger or underlying issue that keeps coming up? Understanding the root cause can help you address it more effectively.
   - Consider whether your partner’s statement about not loving you is a reaction in the heat of the moment or a deeper truth. If it’s a pattern, it may indicate unresolved feelings or dissatisfaction in the relationship.

### 2. **Communicate Calmly and Clearly**
   - Choose a time when you’re both calm to have an honest conversation. Avoid bringing up the issue during or right after an argument.
   - Use “I” statements to express how you feel without blaming him. For example, “I feel hurt when you say you don’t love me during arguments because I’m trying to resolve things and move forward.”
   - Ask him to share his perspective. For example, “Can you help me understand why you feel this way when we argue?”

### 3. **Seek Professional Help**
   - If communication continues to be a struggle, consider couples therapy. A therapist can help you both express your feelings, identify patterns, and develop healthier ways to resolve conflicts.
   - Therapy can also help you both explore whether the relationship can be repaired or if it’s time to consider other options.

### 4. **Focus on Your Needs**
   - While it’s admirable that you’re willing to swallow your pride and apologize, it’s important to ensure your needs are being met too. A healthy relationship requires mutual effort and respect.
   - Take time to reflect on what you need from the relationship and whether those needs are being fulfilled.

### 5. **Consider the Impact on Your Kids**
   - Children are deeply affected by their parents’ relationship. While staying together for the kids isn’t always the best solution, working on your communication and relationship can create a healthier environment for them.
   - If the relationship becomes toxic or unhealthy, it may be better to model healthy boundaries and co-parenting rather than staying in a broken dynamic.

### 6. **Set Boundaries**
   - If your partner continues to say hurtful things during arguments, let him know that this behavior is not acceptable. For example, “When you say you don’t love me during arguments, it’s really painful. If we’re going to work through this, I need us to communicate respectfully.”
   - Be prepared to enforce boundaries if necessary, even if it means taking time apart to reassess the relationship.

### 7. **Take Care of Yourself**
   - This situation is emotionally draining, so prioritize self-care. Lean on friends, family, or a therapist for support.
   - Focus on activities that bring you joy and help you feel grounded.

Ultimately, resolving this will require both of you to be willing to work on the relationship. If your partner is unwilling to engage or make changes, you may need to consider whether this relationship is healthy for you and your children.

There could be contributing factors in his life that could be causing these issues (exposure to violence, sexual/physical abuse, drug use, stressful events in his life, etc.). It is important that these factors are identified so that they can either be eliminated and/or reduced. I wouldn't hesitate to have him evaluated (if he hasn't been already) and to ensure that he is getting the help that he needs whether it be medication and/or therapy.

This behavior is not only dangerous but also indicative of underlying issues that need to be addressed immediately. Here are some steps you can take to ensure your daughter’s safety and address the root causes of your stepson’s behavior:

---

### 1. **Ensure Immediate Safety**
   - **Supervision**: Never leave the children unsupervised, even for a moment. Constant monitoring is essential to prevent further incidents.
   - **Separate Spaces**: If possible, create separate play areas or living spaces to minimize opportunities for conflict.
   - **Emergency Plan**: Teach your daughter to seek help immediately if she feels threatened and ensure she knows how to get to a safe space.

---

### 2. **Seek Professional Help**
   - **Therapy for Your Step Son**: His behavior could stem from unresolved emotional issues, trauma, or other psychological factors. A child psychologist or therapist can help identify the root cause and provide appropriate interventions.
   - **Family Therapy**: This can help address dynamics within the family and improve communication and relationships.
   - **Behavioral Specialist**: A specialist can work with your stepson to develop healthier coping mechanisms and behaviors.

---

### 3. **Stop Punitive Measures**
   - Punishments like spanking or time-outs may not be effective and could exacerbate the problem. Instead, focus on positive reinforcement for good behavior and teaching empathy and problem-solving skills.

---

### 4. **Teach and Model Healthy Behavior**
   - **Empathy Education**: Help your stepson understand the impact of his actions on others. Use age-appropriate discussions, books, or role-playing to teach empathy.
   - **Conflict Resolution**: Teach both children how to resolve conflicts peacefully and express their feelings in healthy ways.

---

### 5. **Address Possible Underlying Issues**
   - **Trauma or Stress**: Has your stepson experienced any trauma, major life changes, or stressors that could contribute to his behavior?
   - **Attention-Seeking**: Sometimes, children act out to gain attention. Ensure he receives positive attention and feels valued in the family.
   - **Exposure to Violence**: Consider whether he has been exposed to violence or aggressive behavior in media, at school, or elsewhere.

---

### 6. **Support Your Daughter**
   - **Reassure Her**: Let her know that she is safe and that you are taking steps to protect her.
   - **Therapy for Her**: If she has been traumatized by these incidents, therapy can help her process her feelings and build resilience.

---

### 7. **Involve School and Other Support Systems**
   - **School Counselor**: Share your concerns with his school counselor or teacher. They may observe behaviors at school and can provide additional support.
   - **Community Resources**: Look for local programs or support groups for families dealing with similar issues.

---

### 8. **Document Incidents**
   - Keep a detailed record of each incident, including dates, times, and what happened. This documentation can be helpful for professionals working with your family and, if necessary, for legal purposes.

---

### 9. **Consider Legal or Protective Measures**
   - If the behavior escalates or your daughter’s safety is at serious risk, you may need to involve child protective services or seek legal advice to explore options for separation or protective orders.

---

### 10. **Take Care of Yourself**
   - This is an incredibly stressful situation for you as a parent. Seek support from friends, family, or a therapist to help you cope and make informed decisions.

What should I do?","While this might not be the first thing you want to discuss when you meet someone, it is important for you to be yourself.  It's better to weed out 10 people who can't accept you to find that one who can.  ","It's important to prioritize your authenticity and happiness while navigating relationships. Here’s some advice on how to approach this:

### 1. **Be True to Yourself**
   - If crossdressing and embracing your feminine side makes you happy, it’s worth continuing. Suppressing a part of yourself for the sake of others can lead to long-term dissatisfaction.
   - Your identity and preferences are valid, and there are people out there who will appreciate and respect you for who you are.

### 2. **Be Upfront, but Tactful**
   - Honesty is key in relationships. Being upfront about your interests early on can help you find someone who is open-minded and accepting.
   - You don’t need to disclose everything on the first date, but as you get to know someone and feel comfortable, share this part of yourself in a way that feels natural.

### 3. **Choose the Right Time to Share**
   - Timing matters. Once you’ve established a connection and feel there’s potential for a relationship, you can bring it up. For example, you might say something like, “There’s something about me that’s important for you to know. I enjoy expressing myself in feminine ways, and it’s a part of who I am.”

### 4. **Educate and Communicate**
   - Some people may not understand crossdressing or may have misconceptions. Be prepared to explain why it’s meaningful to you and how it fits into your life.
   - Emphasize that your attraction to women remains unchanged and that this is simply a form of self-expression.

### 5. **Be Prepared for Different Reactions**
   - Not everyone will be accepting, and that’s okay. It’s better to find someone who appreciates you for who you are than to try to change yourself to fit someone else’s expectations.
   - Rejection can be tough, but it’s a reflection of their preferences, not your worth.

### 6. **Seek Like-Minded People**
   - Consider dating within communities or spaces where individuality and self-expression are celebrated. This might include LGBTQ+ spaces, art or fashion circles, or online platforms where people are more open-minded.

### 7. **Don’t Give Up**
   - It might take time to find someone who fully accepts and embraces this part of you, but they are out there. Many women value authenticity and confidence in a partner.

### 8. **Consider Professional Support**
   - If you’re feeling overwhelmed or unsure, talking to a therapist or counselor who specializes in gender identity and relationships can provide valuable guidance.

Ultimately, the right person will appreciate you for who you are, including your feminine expression. By being honest and true to yourself, you’ll build healthier, more fulfilling relationships.",0.5045114159584045
3109,"I just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. My family and I really need this job.

People keep telling me I have ""anxiety"" and I'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. This is all new to me. What can I do?","It is ok to have anxiety.   Please don't be anxious about being anxious.If you feel anxiety coming over you, then pull off the road to a safe place.   Concentrate on centering yourself and to breath slowly.   Take some sips of water.  Sit still.     The anxiety should pass in about twenty minutes.If it does not pass, then continue calming yourself until you feel safe enough to drive to your hotel.     You can always explain to your supervisor that you were taking care of a medical problem, because anxiety is a medical problem.","First, congratulations on your new job! It’s understandable to feel anxious about such a big change, especially when it involves being far from home and family. Here are some practical steps to help you manage your anxiety and feel more confident as you navigate this new chapter:

### 1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**
   - It’s normal to feel anxious about unfamiliar situations. Recognizing and accepting your feelings is the first step toward managing them. Anxiety doesn’t mean you’re weak—it’s your body’s way of responding to stress.

### 2. **Educate Yourself About Anxiety**
   - Learn about anxiety and anxiety attacks. Understanding what’s happening in your body (e.g., fight-or-flight response) can help you feel more in control. Anxiety attacks are temporary and not dangerous, even though they can feel overwhelming.

### 3. **Develop a Toolkit for Managing Anxiety**
   - **Breathing Techniques:** Practice deep breathing exercises (e.g., inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, exhale for 6 counts). This can calm your nervous system during moments of stress.
   - **Grounding Exercises:** Use techniques like the 5-4-3-2-1 method (identify 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, and 1 you taste) to stay present.
   - **Positive Affirmations:** Remind yourself, “I am safe,” “I can handle this,” or “This feeling will pass.”

### 4. **Prepare for Travel**
   - **Plan Ahead:** Familiarize yourself with your travel route, accommodations, and schedule. Having a plan can reduce uncertainty.
   - **Pack Comfort Items:** Bring things that make you feel secure, like photos of your family, a favorite book, or calming music.
   - **Stay Connected:** Schedule regular check-ins with your family to feel connected and supported.

### 5. **Practice Self-Care**
   - **Sleep:** Prioritize rest to help your body manage stress.
   - **Nutrition:** Eat balanced meals and avoid excessive caffeine or sugar, which can worsen anxiety.
   - **Exercise:** Physical activity can help reduce anxiety and improve your mood.

### 6. **Seek Support**
   - **Talk to Someone:** Share your feelings with a trusted friend, family member, or therapist. You don’t have to face this alone.
   - **Professional Help:** If anxiety feels overwhelming, consider speaking with a mental health professional. They can provide tools and strategies tailored to your needs.

### 7. **Challenge Negative Thoughts**
   - Anxiety often comes with “what if” thinking. Ask yourself, “What’s the worst that could happen, and how would I handle it?” This can help you feel more prepared and less fearful.

### 8. **Take It One Step at a Time**
   - Focus on small, manageable goals rather than overwhelming yourself with the big picture. Celebrate each success, no matter how small.

### 9. **Consider Anxiety Management Apps**
   - Apps like Calm, Headspace, or Insight Timer offer guided meditations, breathing exercises, and tools to manage anxiety.

### 10. **Remind Yourself Why You’re Doing This**
   - When anxiety feels overwhelming, reconnect with your purpose. This job is important for you and your family, and you’re taking this step to provide for them.

Remember, you’re stronger than you think, and it’s okay to ask for help. Over time, you’ll likely feel more comfortable and confident as you adjust to your new routine. You’ve got this!",0.5019724369049072
1713,"I have been noticing myself really enjoying watching/reading about gay or lesbian couples. I've also been imagining what it might be like to date a girl, and I like the idea. I also find guys cute too. Does this make me bisexual?",Hello!  Thank you for your question.  Exploring your sexual orientation and attraction is a wonderful opportunity to get to know yourself!  I would be curious to know what feelings you might have related to the possibility of being bi; What messages you may have received related to this orientation and any concerns you have about possible sexual orientations.,"It sounds like you're exploring your feelings and attractions, which is a natural and important part of understanding yourself. Based on what you've shared, it’s possible that you might be bisexual, but ultimately, only you can determine your identity. Here’s some context that might help:

- **Bisexuality** is the capacity to feel attraction to more than one gender, though not necessarily to the same degree or in the same way. If you find both girls and guys cute and can imagine yourself dating either, that could align with bisexuality.  
- **Fluidity** is also common—attractions can change or evolve over time, and that’s okay.  
- **Curiosity** is normal too—imagining what it might be like to date someone of the same gender doesn’t necessarily mean you’re bisexual, but it could be a sign that you’re open to exploring that part of yourself.  

There’s no rush to label yourself if you’re not ready. You can take your time to explore your feelings, experiences, and attractions. Talking to people you trust, reading about others’ experiences, or even journaling about your thoughts can help clarify things for you. Remember, your identity is valid no matter where you land!",0.5120114684104919
2821,"I've tried working out and eating fruits and vegetables, but I always seem to eat the junk in the house.","I know some people do better when they don't have as much junk food in the house. This is not as tempting then. Having said that, maybe you can reward yourself with different things, such as having dessert on certain days. If you are concerned about mostly eating habits, consider seeing a nutritionist. They can help you find the balance between what it is that you really want and your goals. I'm not sure how this links to happiness for you, but hopefully looking at your choices can lead you toward your goal of being healthier.","It’s great that you’re working out and eating fruits and vegetables—that’s already a big step in the right direction! However, it’s completely normal to struggle with cravings for junk food, especially when it’s easily accessible at home. Here are some strategies to help you manage this challenge:

### 1. **Out of Sight, Out of Mind**
   - **Remove Temptation:** If possible, avoid keeping junk food in the house. If it’s not there, you can’t eat it.
   - **Healthy Front and Center:** Keep fruits, vegetables, and other healthy snacks visible and easily accessible. For example, place a fruit bowl on the counter or pre-cut veggies in the fridge.

### 2. **Plan and Prepare**
   - **Meal Prep:** Prepare healthy meals and snacks in advance so you’re less likely to reach for junk food when you’re hungry.
   - **Healthy Alternatives:** Find healthier versions of your favorite junk foods. For example, air-popped popcorn instead of chips, or dark chocolate instead of candy bars.

### 3. **Mindful Eating**
   - **Pause Before Eating:** When you feel the urge to eat junk food, pause and ask yourself if you’re truly hungry or just craving something out of habit or boredom.
   - **Portion Control:** If you do decide to indulge, portion out a small amount instead of eating straight from the bag or box.

### 4. **Identify Triggers**
   - **Emotional Eating:** Are you reaching for junk food when you’re stressed, bored, or tired? Identifying these triggers can help you find healthier ways to cope, like going for a walk, meditating, or calling a friend.
   - **Environment:** Are there specific times or places where you’re more likely to eat junk food? Try to change your routine to avoid these situations.

### 5. **Build Healthy Habits Gradually**
   - **Small Changes:** Instead of trying to overhaul your diet all at once, make small, sustainable changes. For example, start by replacing one junk food snack with a healthier option each day.
   - **Celebrate Wins:** Acknowledge and celebrate your successes, no matter how small. This can help keep you motivated.

### 6. **Stay Hydrated**
   - **Drink Water:** Sometimes thirst can be mistaken for hunger. Drinking a glass of water before reaching for a snack can help curb unnecessary cravings.

### 7. **Get Support**
   - **Accountability Partner:** Share your goals with a friend or family member who can help keep you accountable.
   - **Professional Help:** If you’re struggling with emotional eating or feel like your cravings are out of control, consider seeking help from a dietitian or therapist.

### 8. **Be Kind to Yourself**
   - **Don’t Beat Yourself Up:** It’s okay to have moments of weakness. What matters is getting back on track and continuing to make healthy choices.

Remember, changing habits takes time and effort, but with persistence and the right strategies, you can reduce your reliance on junk food and build a healthier relationship with food. Keep going—you’ve got this! 💪🍎🥦",0.4444690942764282

It’s a common challenge, and many people have successfully overcome it with time and practice. Here are some strategies that might help:

### 1. **Understand Your Anxiety**
   - Recognize that your discomfort is a natural response to perceived judgment or pressure. Social anxiety often stems from fear of being evaluated or making mistakes.
   - Remind yourself that most people aren’t judging you as harshly as you think—they’re often focused on themselves.

### 2. **Start Small**
   - Gradually expose yourself to situations that make you uncomfortable. For example, start by speaking up in smaller, more familiar groups before tackling larger settings.
   - Practice answering questions or sharing your thoughts with friends or family first.

### 3. **Prepare and Practice**
   - If you’re nervous about speaking in class or public, prepare what you want to say in advance. Rehearse it out loud to build confidence.
   - Practice deep breathing or grounding techniques to calm your nerves before speaking.

### 4. **Shift Your Focus**
   - Instead of focusing on yourself, concentrate on the message you’re delivering or the question you’re answering. This can help take the pressure off.
   - Remind yourself that your goal is to contribute, not to be perfect.

### 5. **Challenge Negative Thoughts**
   - When you catch yourself thinking, “Everyone will think I’m awkward,” challenge that thought. Ask yourself, “Is this really true? What’s the worst that could happen?”
   - Replace negative self-talk with positive affirmations like, “I have valuable things to say.”

### 6. **Celebrate Small Wins**
   - Acknowledge and celebrate every step forward, no matter how small. For example, if you answer a question in class, give yourself credit for taking that step.

### 7. **Seek Support**
   - Talk to a trusted friend, teacher, or counselor about how you’re feeling. They can offer encouragement and help you practice.
   - Consider joining a support group or seeking therapy, especially cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which is highly effective for social anxiety.

### 8. **Practice Self-Compassion**
   - Be kind to yourself. It’s okay to feel nervous, and it’s okay to make mistakes. Everyone does at some point.
   - Remind yourself that growth takes time, and you’re making progress.

### 9. **Visualize Success**
   - Imagine yourself speaking confidently and handling attention well. Visualization can help reduce anxiety and build a positive mindset.

### 10. **Consider Professional Help**
   - If your anxiety feels overwhelming or interferes with your daily life, a mental health professional can provide tailored strategies and support.

I lose control of myself and become angry and anxious and just eat and purge. Over and over. Can someone please point me in the right direction for help?","Eating disorders usually result from a sense of insecurity about who the person is, whether they are good enough compared with anyone else, and whether the way they person lives is effective.If you have a style you're already happy with to reflect on these sorts of topics, keep following your own logic with the aim to free yourself, which usually takes place gradually, from these sort of self-doubts.The other approach would be to find an unperson or an online discussion group where you'd be able to offer and receive the support from other people who live with a similar problem.Good luck in your studies!","First, I want to acknowledge your courage in reaching out for help. Recognizing that you need support is a significant and brave step toward recovery. You’re not alone in this, and there are effective ways to address bulimia and regain control of your life.

387,I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?,It is absolutely a typical response.  Many of my clients are nervous the first couple of times we meet.  This is essentially a stranger with whom you are sharing your feelings.,"Yes, it's completely normal to feel nervous and shaky when starting therapy, even after a few sessions. Therapy is a deeply personal and vulnerable process, and it’s common to feel anxious when discussing emotions, experiences, or struggles—especially with someone you’re still getting to know. Here are a few reasons why this might be happening:

1. **Vulnerability**: Therapy often involves exploring sensitive or painful topics, which can naturally trigger anxiety or physical reactions like shakiness.

2. **Uncertainty**: You might feel unsure about what to expect or how the therapist will respond, which can contribute to nervousness.

3. **Fear of Judgment**: Even though therapists are trained to be nonjudgmental, it’s common to worry about being judged or misunderstood.

4. **New Environment**: Therapy is a unique space, and it can take time to feel comfortable in this setting.

### What You Can Do:
- **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: It’s okay to feel nervous. Remind yourself that this is a normal part of the process.
- **Communicate with Your Therapist**: Let them know how you’re feeling. They can help normalize your experience and work with you to make the space feel safer.
- **Practice Grounding Techniques**: If you feel shaky, try deep breathing, grounding exercises, or mindfulness to help calm your body.
- **Give It Time**: Building trust and comfort with your therapist takes time. It’s okay if you don’t feel completely at ease right away.

If the nervousness persists or feels overwhelming, it might be worth discussing with your therapist to explore whether there are specific fears or triggers that need to be addressed. Therapy is a journey, and it’s okay to take it at your own pace. You’re doing something brave and important by showing up, even when it feels hard.",0.5536466836929321

What can I do?","Trust and believe your own feelings.Emotions are real and reflect how someone feels about a situation.Since you're sad about losing a loved one, be patient w your feelings about this.  Basically, be guided by how you feel and eventually you will feel different emotions which I hope will be happier ones.","I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're going through an incredibly tough time, and it’s important to acknowledge how deeply this is affecting you. Here are some steps that might help you navigate these feelings:

### 1. **Acknowledge Your Pain**
   - It’s okay to feel the way you do, especially after a significant loss. Grief and emotional numbness are valid responses to pain. Allow yourself to feel without judgment.

### 2. **Reach Out for Support**
   - Even if you feel disconnected from your family or girlfriend, consider sharing your feelings with someone you trust. Sometimes, just talking about what you’re going through can provide relief.
   - If you’re not comfortable talking to someone close to you, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor. Professional support can be incredibly helpful in processing grief and rebuilding emotional connections.

### 3. **Practice Self-Compassion**
   - It’s easy to be hard on yourself when you’re struggling, but try to treat yourself with the same kindness you’d offer a friend in your situation. Remind yourself that it’s okay to not be okay right now.

### 4. **Small Steps Toward Reconnection**
   - If you’re feeling distant from your girlfriend or others, start with small gestures. Even a simple, honest conversation about how you’re feeling can help bridge the gap.
   - If you’re not ready to connect with others, focus on small acts of self-care, like taking a walk, listening to music, or journaling your thoughts.

### 5. **Honor Your Loved One**
   - Grief can feel overwhelming, but finding ways to honor the person you’ve lost might help. This could be through writing a letter to them, creating a memory box, or doing something they loved.

### 6. **Consider Professional Help**
   - If these feelings persist or worsen, it’s important to seek help from a mental health professional. They can help you work through grief, self-hatred, and emotional numbness in a structured and supportive way.

### 7. **Be Patient with Yourself**
   - Healing takes time, and it’s not a linear process. It’s okay to have bad days, and it’s okay to not feel “normal” right now. Give yourself permission to heal at your own pace.

### 8. **Challenge Negative Thoughts**
   - When you catch yourself thinking, “I’m ugly” or “I hate myself,” try to challenge those thoughts. Ask yourself if you’d say the same things to someone you care about. If not, try to reframe those thoughts with more kindness.

### 9. **Explore Support Groups**
   - Sometimes, connecting with others who have experienced similar losses can be comforting. Look for grief support groups in your area or online.

### 10. **Focus on the Present**
   - When you’re feeling overwhelmed, try grounding techniques to bring yourself back to the present moment. This could be deep breathing, focusing on your senses, or practicing mindfulness.

Remember, you don’t have to go through this alone. Reaching out for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You deserve support and care as you navigate these difficult emotions.",0.5500780940055847
1344,"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","From your initial description, I would say that your mother is ""Maloriented"". In this stage of Alzheimer's individuals tend to be blaming and difficult to deal with. They may often hide or throw things away and then blame family members for this. In addition, if they are incontinent, they may blame a leaky roof or something else when they are wet. You are correct that this is not her fault, but often for family members this does not make it any easier for you to cope. I strongly suggest that you learn communication strategies that will help you to communicate with your mother in a way that lets her work through the difficulties associated with the disease. I always suggest Validation techniques to family members.In addition, you need to give yourself some kind attention and take time out from your circumstances as needed. You need to be able to center yourself and come to acceptance that this is your mother's illness that is the problem, not her and certainly not you.","I'm so sorry you're going through this. Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's can be incredibly challenging, emotionally draining, and isolating. It's completely normal to feel frustrated, angry, and even guilty at times. Remember, your feelings are valid, and you're not alone in this. Here are some strategies to help you cope:

### 1. **Understand the Disease**
   - Alzheimer's can cause significant changes in behavior, personality, and cognition. Your mother's nastiness or unrealistic requests are likely symptoms of the disease, not a reflection of her true self or her feelings toward you.
   - Educate yourself about Alzheimer's to better understand what she’s experiencing. This can help you reframe her behavior as part of the illness rather than something personal.

### 2. **Practice Self-Compassion**
   - Acknowledge that it’s okay to feel frustrated or angry. You’re human, and caring for someone with Alzheimer’s is incredibly difficult. Be kind to yourself and remind yourself that you’re doing the best you can.
   - Avoid guilt by recognizing that your reactions are normal and that you’re not a bad person for feeling this way.

### 3. **Develop Coping Strategies**
   - **Take Breaks:** Caregiver burnout is real. If possible, arrange for respite care or ask family and friends to help so you can take time for yourself.
   - **Deep Breathing or Mindfulness:** When you feel overwhelmed, pause and take a few deep breaths or practice mindfulness to ground yourself.
   - **Journaling:** Write down your feelings to process them and release pent-up emotions.

### 4. **Adjust Your Expectations**
   - Let go of the expectation that your mother will behave as she once did. Instead, focus on small moments of connection or joy, even if they’re fleeting.
   - Accept that her requests or behaviors may not make sense to you. Instead of arguing or trying to reason, try redirecting her or responding with empathy.

### 5. **Use Empathy and Redirection**
   - When she’s being mean or demanding, remind yourself that it’s the disease talking, not her. Respond with patience and kindness, even when it’s hard.
   - If she asks for something unrealistic, try redirecting her attention to something else or offering a simpler alternative.

### 6. **Seek Support**
   - **Join a Support Group:** Connecting with others who are going through similar experiences can provide comfort, advice, and understanding.
   - **Talk to a Therapist:** A counselor or therapist can help you process your emotions and develop coping strategies.
   - **Lean on Family and Friends:** Don’t hesitate to ask for help or simply share your feelings with someone you trust.

### 7. **Take Care of Yourself**
   - Prioritize your physical and emotional well-being. Eat well, exercise, get enough sleep, and make time for activities that bring you joy.
   - Remember that you can’t pour from an empty cup—taking care of yourself allows you to better care for your mother.

### 8. **Find Moments of Joy**
   - Focus on small, positive interactions with your mother, even if they’re brief. A smile, a shared laugh, or a moment of connection can make a big difference.
   - Celebrate the good moments and let them remind you why you’re doing this.

### 9. **Consider Professional Help**
   - If her behavior becomes too difficult to manage, consult her doctor. There may be medications or therapies that can help manage her symptoms.
   - If caregiving becomes overwhelming, explore options like in-home care or assisted living to ensure both you and your mother are supported.

### 10. **Remember Your Love for Her**
   - In the midst of the challenges, try to hold onto the love you have for your mother. Remind yourself that you’re doing this because you care deeply for her, even when it’s hard.

You’re doing an incredibly difficult and selfless thing by caring for your mother. It’s okay to struggle, and it’s okay to ask for help. Be gentle with yourself, and know that your efforts matter, even when they feel thankless.",0.4334508180618286

How do I stop this behavior and thought process?","Good for you on your keen awareness of your difficulties and your willingness to change!The type of change you'd like to achieve is possible, and since a change in self-confidence and self-love is deep rooted, this comes about gradually and slowly.Keep understanding yourself during your moments of doubt and anxiety.  Its fine to feel terrible and certainly better to know you feel insecure than to act upon the insecurity by being with men who take advantage of you.Everyone needs to feel loved and recognized.Until you attract a partner who will love and appreciate you, develop relationships with co-workers and classmates, neighbors, so that you have some quality of giving and being given by someone.It is a way to nurture yourself and another person until your strength and self-belief grow bigger.","It takes a lot of self-awareness and courage to recognize these patterns in your relationships, and that’s an important first step. Breaking these cycles and building healthier relationships with others—and with yourself—is absolutely possible. Here are some steps to help you shift your behavior and thought process:

---

### 1. **Understand Your Patterns**
   - Reflect on why you gravitate toward unavailable or emotionally abusive men. Often, this stems from early experiences (e.g., childhood, past relationships) that shaped your beliefs about love and worthiness.
   - Ask yourself: *What do I believe I deserve? Do I feel worthy of love and respect?* If the answer is no, work on challenging those beliefs.

---

### 2. **Build Self-Worth and Confidence**
   - Practice self-compassion. Remind yourself that you deserve love, respect, and effort in a relationship.
   - Focus on your strengths, accomplishments, and qualities that make you unique. Write them down and revisit them often.
   - Engage in activities that make you feel good about yourself—whether it’s a hobby, exercise, or learning something new.

---

### 3. **Learn to Be Comfortable Alone**
   - Being alone doesn’t mean being lonely. Start small by spending time with yourself doing things you enjoy, like reading, journaling, or taking a walk.
   - Practice mindfulness or meditation to become more comfortable with your own thoughts and emotions.
   - Remind yourself that you are enough on your own. A relationship should complement your life, not define it.

---

### 4. **Set Boundaries**
   - Identify what behaviors are unacceptable to you in a relationship (e.g., emotional abuse, lack of effort, disrespect) and commit to enforcing those boundaries.
   - Practice saying no. It’s okay to prioritize your needs and not be at someone’s “beck and call.”
   - If someone accuses you of being controlling, evaluate whether their accusation is valid or if they’re manipulating you. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect and compromise.

---

### 5. **Stop Hoping for Change**
   - Accept that you cannot change someone else. If a man is unavailable or emotionally abusive, he’s unlikely to change—no matter how much you hope or try.
   - Focus on what you can control: your own actions, choices, and responses.

---

### 6. **Seek Support**
   - Talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you explore the root causes of your patterns and guide you in building healthier relationships.
   - Surround yourself with supportive friends or family who uplift and encourage you.

---

### 7. **Practice Healthy Relationship Habits**
   - Look for partners who are emotionally available, respectful, and willing to put in effort.
   - Take things slow. Get to know someone before fully committing to ensure they align with your values and needs.
   - Communicate openly and honestly about your expectations in a relationship.

---

### 8. **Focus on Personal Growth**
   - Work on becoming the person you want to be, independent of a relationship. This will naturally attract healthier partners.
   - Set goals for yourself—personal, professional, or creative—and work toward achieving them.

---

### 9. **Challenge Your Fear of Being Alone**
   - Ask yourself: *What am I afraid of if I’m alone?* Often, the fear is rooted in insecurity or a belief that you need someone else to feel complete.
   - Remind yourself that being alone is better than being in a toxic or unfulfilling relationship.

---

### 10. **Be Patient with Yourself**
   - Changing deeply ingrained patterns takes time and effort. Celebrate small victories along the way.
   - If you slip up, don’t beat yourself up. Acknowledge it, learn from it, and move forward.

By focusing on your own growth, self-worth, and boundaries, you’ll naturally start to attract healthier, more fulfilling relationships. You deserve a partner who values you, respects you, and is willing to put in the effort to build a secure and loving relationship.",0.365436315536499
3056,"I was with my friends fishing by a pond. I found a frog and stabbed it with my friend's knife. I'm not sure why I did it. My friends saw me do it it and were shocked and got really mad at me.

Now if someone brings it up I get really upset and panicked. I don't know why I feel like this. Does this mean there is something wrong with me?","The good news is your awareness that being violent to animals feels out of character for you.   I'm glad you have awareness and I'm glad you are not at ease with killing frogs.Fairly likely that you were acting out aggressively toward the frog, feelings of being on the receiving side of similar type of violence.Basically, you did unto the frog what someone has or to you, feels like, has been done to you.Use your surprising finding of how strong your anger and most likely inward pain.   Reflect on your closest relationships and how these people treat you.   It is possible you feel more hurt by someone who is close to you than you ever realized.Stabbing innocent frogs is wrong.  It is understandable as a way to show you how much inner pain you probably have.It is also wrong that someone close to you hurt you.The direction to go is to recognize your pain and then decide how to go about changing what is possible on your side of that or those relationship(s).","It’s understandable that you’re feeling upset and panicked about this situation. What you’re experiencing could be a mix of guilt, shame, and confusion about your actions. Let’s break this down:

### 1. **Understanding Your Actions**
   - Sometimes people act impulsively without fully understanding why, especially in moments of curiosity, peer pressure, or heightened emotions. Your action of stabbing the frog may have been a spontaneous decision that you didn’t fully think through.
   - It’s important to reflect on why you did it. Were you trying to impress your friends? Were you curious about how the frog would react? Understanding the root of your behavior can help you process it.

### 2. **Your Emotional Reaction**
   - Feeling upset and panicked when the incident is brought up suggests that you feel remorse or regret about what happened. This is a sign that you have empathy and recognize that your actions caused harm, which is a positive trait.
   - These emotions might also stem from fear of judgment or concern about how others perceive you after the incident.

### 3. **Is There Something Wrong With You?**
   - Acting impulsively in one moment doesn’t mean there’s something inherently wrong with you. People make mistakes, and what matters is how you learn from them and grow.
   - However, if you find yourself frequently acting impulsively or harming others (human or animal) without understanding why, it might be helpful to talk to a trusted adult, counselor, or therapist. They can help you explore these behaviors and develop healthier ways to manage your emotions and actions.

### 4. **What Can You Do Now?**
   - **Acknowledge Your Feelings:** It’s okay to feel upset. Acknowledge your emotions and give yourself space to process them.
   - **Reflect on the Incident:** Think about why you acted the way you did and what you can learn from it.
   - **Apologize if Possible:** If your friends are still upset, consider apologizing to them. Explain that you’re reflecting on your actions and regret what happened.
   - **Learn and Grow:** Use this as an opportunity to think about how you want to act in the future. Developing empathy and self-awareness can help you make better decisions.

### 5. **Seek Support if Needed**
   - If these feelings of panic or guilt persist or feel overwhelming, talking to a counselor or therapist can be incredibly helpful. They can provide a safe space to explore your emotions and help you develop coping strategies.

Remember, everyone makes mistakes, and what matters most is how you respond to them. You’re already showing self-awareness by questioning your actions, which is a positive step toward growth.",0.4924856424331665
1135,"I’m a man, and I’m soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but it’s been happening a lot. I don't know what to do.","Hello, and thank you for your question. When faced with these kinds of difficult challenges, I usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be. Indeed, it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we don't feel very content with our lives. Perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions: What kind of person do I want to be deep in my heart? What kind of character do I want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching? How would I want others to describe me? Let's say that you want others to see you as being authentic, and YOU also value authenticity as something you want to live by. You may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now. That you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart. This is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation. So please, try not to feel alone. We all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc. And I am not just talking about being unaccepted by others, but a person may have a VERY hard time accepting themselves. Thinking about your values and living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom, but I won't lie, it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time. For example, someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for, even if that means people may disapprove. That may cause a lot of pain, but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity. It may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy, which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them. I would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are... both as an individual and as someone's fiancé.Above all, I wish you well in this journey. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC","It’s clear that you’re in a complex and emotionally challenging situation, and it’s important to approach this with honesty, self-reflection, and care for everyone involved. Here are some steps to consider:

### 1. **Reflect on Your Feelings and Actions**
   - Ask yourself why you’ve been engaging in these encounters. Is it about curiosity, unmet needs, fear of commitment, or something else? Understanding your motivations can help you make clearer decisions.
   - Consider how these actions align with your values and the life you want to build with your partner.

### 2. **Be Honest with Yourself**
   - Are you fully committed to your upcoming marriage? If you’re unsure about your feelings or your ability to be faithful, it’s crucial to address this before making a lifelong commitment.
   - Acknowledge the potential harm your actions could cause to your partner and your relationship.

### 3. **Communicate with Your Partner**
   - Honesty is the foundation of a healthy relationship. While it may be difficult, consider having an open and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings and actions. This will allow them to make informed decisions about the relationship.
   - Be prepared for a range of emotions from your partner, including hurt, anger, or confusion.

### 4. **Seek Professional Guidance**
   - A therapist or counselor can help you navigate your feelings, understand your behavior, and make decisions that align with your values and goals.
   - Couples therapy may also be beneficial if you and your partner decide to work through this together.

### 5. **Consider the Consequences**
   - Think about the impact of your actions on your partner, your relationship, and your future. Continuing to hide this behavior could lead to greater pain and mistrust down the line.
   - If you’re not ready for monogamy or marriage, it’s better to address this now rather than after the wedding.

### 6. **Make a Decision**
   - Based on your reflection and conversations, decide whether you’re ready to fully commit to your partner and marriage. If not, it may be kinder to end the relationship rather than enter into a marriage under false pretenses.
   - If you’re committed to making things work, take steps to rebuild trust and address any underlying issues in your relationship.

### 7. **Take Responsibility**
   - Own up to your actions and take responsibility for the impact they’ve had. This is a crucial step in moving forward, whether that’s with your partner or on your own.

This is a difficult situation, but addressing it honestly and thoughtfully is the best way to move forward. Remember, seeking help from a professional can provide valuable support as you navigate this challenging time.",0.4552139639854431
26,"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",Absolutely not.  I strongly recommending working on one issue/need at a time.  In therapy you will set smart goals and objectives that will help you reach your goals.  I see you as a survivor and not a victim.  Best wishes to you.,"First, I want to acknowledge the strength and resilience it takes to share your story and consider seeking help. Your experiences are significant, and it’s understandable to feel overwhelmed by the complexity of what you’ve been through. However, no, you do not have “too many issues” to address in counseling. Counseling is designed to help people navigate complex and multifaceted challenges, and your concerns are absolutely within the scope of what therapy can address.

Here are a few things to consider as you explore counseling:

1. **Therapy is a Safe Space to Unpack Your Experiences**  
   A skilled therapist can help you process your history of sexual abuse, the emotional and physical toll of breast cancer, and the ongoing struggles with insomnia, depression, and anxiety. You don’t have to tackle everything at once—therapy can be tailored to your pace and priorities.

2. **Addressing One Issue Can Impact Others**  
   Many of the challenges you’ve described are interconnected. For example, working on self-esteem might help reduce anxiety, and processing past trauma could alleviate some of the emotional weight contributing to depression. Therapy can help you see how these issues are linked and address them holistically.

3. **You Don’t Have to Do It Alone**  
   While you’ve been happily married for 35 years, it’s okay to seek support outside of your relationship. A therapist can provide a nonjudgmental, professional perspective and equip you with tools to manage your emotions and experiences.

4. **Finding the Right Therapist is Key**  
   Look for a therapist who has experience working with trauma, chronic illness, and mental health challenges like depression and anxiety. Many therapists specialize in multiple areas, and they can help you prioritize and address your concerns in a way that feels manageable.

5. **It’s Never Too Late to Start**  
   Even though you’ve never had counseling before, it’s never too late to begin. Therapy can be transformative at any stage of life, and taking this step is a powerful act of self-care.

6. **Be Patient with Yourself**  
   Healing is a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. You’ve already shown incredible resilience by surviving and thriving through so much. Counseling can be a space to build on that strength and find new ways to care for yourself.

If you’re unsure where to start, consider reaching out to a therapist for an initial consultation. They can help you outline a plan and reassure you that your concerns are valid and manageable. You deserve support, and therapy can be a meaningful step toward healing and growth.",0.514600396156311

Have you ever told her about how much she means to you (when she's not angry)?","I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way. It’s incredibly painful to feel unloved or treated differently, especially by someone as important as your mom. You deserve to feel valued, cared for, and supported. Here are a few things to consider:

1. **Your Feelings Are Valid**: It’s okay to feel hurt, sad, or frustrated. Your emotions matter, and it’s important to acknowledge them.

2. **Talk to Someone You Trust**: If you feel comfortable, consider sharing your feelings with a trusted adult, teacher, counselor, or friend. Sometimes, having someone listen can make a big difference.

3. **Communicate with Your Mom**: If you feel safe, try expressing how you feel to your mom. Use “I” statements, like “I feel hurt when I’m yelled at” or “I feel left out when I see you talking to my siblings.” She may not realize how her actions are affecting you.

4. **Focus on Self-Care**: Take time to do things that make you feel good—whether it’s reading, drawing, listening to music, or spending time with friends who make you feel supported.

5. **Remember Your Worth**: How your mom treats you doesn’t define your value. You are important, unique, and deserving of love and kindness.

   My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules. She is trying to control my life. What should I do?","That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now. The first thing to under is that you can’t change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior. The thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions.  You may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan. The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior. Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy. Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack.  There are ways you can deal with controlling parents – and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you’ll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they’re trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you’re losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust.

Here are some steps you can take to address the situation constructively:

### 1. **Communicate Openly and Calmly**
   - Have an honest conversation with your mother about how you're feeling. Express your desire for independence while acknowledging her concerns.
   - Use ""I"" statements (e.g., ""I feel like I need more freedom to make my own decisions"") to avoid sounding accusatory.

### 2. **Understand Her Perspective**
   - Try to see things from her point of view. She may be trying to protect you or ensure you’re on the right path.
   - Acknowledge her efforts and show gratitude for her support.

### 3. **Set Boundaries**
   - Propose reasonable boundaries that work for both of you. For example, agree on curfews, responsibilities, or areas where you can make your own decisions.
   - Be willing to compromise to maintain harmony.

### 4. **Take Responsibility**
   - Show that you’re mature and responsible by contributing to the household (e.g., helping with chores, paying a small amount of rent if possible).
   - Demonstrate that you’re working toward independence (e.g., saving money, pursuing education or a career).

### 5. **Focus on Your Goals**
   - Create a plan to become financially independent. This might include finding a better-paying job, learning new skills, or budgeting to save money.
   - Share your goals with your mother to show her you’re serious about moving forward.

I am alone sad and frustrated.","Sounds like you already see what's amiss. You're looking for fix-er-uppers! When you meet these men they need you. And you're filled by fixing them.  And when they are fixed, what do they have to give you? What's your need in relationship? What if you found someone who didn't need fixing? ","It’s clear that you have a big heart and a strong desire to help others, which are wonderful qualities. However, it’s important to recognize that relationships built on rescuing or fixing someone often lead to imbalance, frustration, and emotional exhaustion. Here are some steps to help you break this pattern and create healthier relationships:

---

### 1. **Understand the Pattern**
   - Reflect on why you’re drawn to men in bad situations. Do you feel needed or validated when you help someone? Are you trying to prove your worth or fix something from your past? Understanding the root of this pattern can help you address it.
   - Ask yourself: *Am I attracted to their potential, or who they are right now?* If you’re drawn to their potential, you may be setting yourself up for disappointment.

---

### 2. **Set Boundaries**
   - Learn to separate compassion from responsibility. You can care about someone’s struggles without taking on the burden of fixing their life.
   - Practice saying no. It’s okay to offer support, but not at the expense of your own well-being.

---

### 3. **Focus on Your Own Needs**
   - Ask yourself: *What do I need in a relationship?* Write down the qualities of a healthy, supportive partner and use this as a guide.
   - Prioritize your own happiness and fulfillment. A relationship should add to your life, not drain you.

---

### 4. **Look for Equal Partnerships**
   - Seek out relationships where both partners are emotionally available, stable, and capable of giving and receiving support equally.
   - Avoid relationships where you feel like the sole provider of emotional, financial, or practical support.

---

### 5. **Work on Self-Worth**
   - If you feel the need to prove your worth by helping others, it may be a sign that you need to build your self-esteem. Remind yourself that you are worthy of love and respect just as you are—not because of what you do for others.
   - Consider therapy or self-help resources to explore and heal any underlying issues that may be driving this pattern.

---

### 6. **Take It Slow**
   - When you meet someone new, take time to get to know them before committing. Look for red flags, such as instability, dependency, or a history of unhealthy relationships.
   - Ask yourself: *Is this person capable of being a supportive, equal partner?*

---

### 7. **Practice Self-Care**
   - Invest time in activities and relationships that bring you joy and fulfillment outside of romantic partnerships.
   - Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who value you for who you are, not what you can do for them.

---

### 8. **Seek Support**
   - Consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you explore this pattern and develop healthier relationship habits.
   - Join a support group or community where you can share your experiences and learn from others.

---

### 9. **Shift Your Perspective**
   - Remind yourself that you cannot “save” someone—they must take responsibility for their own life and choices.
   - Focus on building relationships based on mutual respect, trust, and shared goals rather than rescuing or fixing.

   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",Just go! You start with the most prevalent issue by talking with your therapist. Healing one issue can have a ripple effect and heal other issues as well.,"First, I want to acknowledge your strength and resilience in carrying so much for so long. It’s clear you’ve been through incredibly difficult experiences, and yet you’ve built a lasting, happy marriage—a testament to your capacity for love and connection. You are not alone, and seeking counseling is a courageous and positive step toward healing.

To answer your question: **No, you do not have too many issues to address in counseling.** Therapy is designed to help people navigate complex and overlapping challenges, and a skilled therapist will work with you to prioritize and address your concerns in a way that feels manageable. Here’s how counseling can help:

1. **Holistic Approach:** A therapist can help you explore how your experiences—sexual abuse, breast cancer, insomnia, depression, anxiety, and self-esteem—are interconnected. They’ll support you in understanding how these issues impact your life and help you develop strategies to cope and heal.

2. **Pacing:** You don’t have to address everything at once. Therapy is a process, and you can work on one issue at a time or focus on what feels most pressing in the moment. Your therapist will respect your pace and guide you gently.

3. **Building Self-Esteem:** Counseling can help you reframe negative beliefs about yourself and build a stronger sense of self-worth. This can create a foundation for addressing other challenges.

4. **Trauma-Informed Care:** If you’ve never had counseling for your history of sexual abuse, a therapist trained in trauma can help you process and heal from those experiences in a safe and supportive way.

5. **Managing Anxiety and Depression:** Therapy can provide tools to manage anxiety and depression, whether through cognitive-behavioral techniques, mindfulness, or other evidence-based approaches.

6. **Support for Insomnia:** While therapy isn’t a substitute for medical treatment for insomnia, it can help address underlying emotional or psychological factors that may be contributing to your sleep difficulties.

7. **Strengths-Based Perspective:** Your therapist will help you recognize and build on your strengths, including your resilience, your ability to maintain a loving marriage, and your willingness to seek help.

It’s also worth noting that therapy can be tailored to your needs. Some people benefit from short-term, focused counseling, while others find long-term therapy helpful for deeper healing. You and your therapist can decide together what feels right for you.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the idea of starting therapy, here are a few tips:
- **Start Small:** You don’t have to share everything in the first session. Begin by sharing what feels comfortable and build trust over time.
- **Find the Right Fit:** It’s okay to “shop around” for a therapist who feels like a good match for you. Look for someone who specializes in trauma, anxiety, or self-esteem issues if possible.
- **Be Patient with Yourself:** Healing is a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time.

You’ve already taken a brave step by considering counseling. It’s never too late to seek support, and you deserve care, understanding, and healing. You are not defined by your struggles, and with the right help, you can find greater peace and fulfillment.",0.5209181308746338
1392,"My wife and mother are having tense disagreements. In the past, they’ve had minor differences. For example, my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing; my mother would complain my wife is lazy.
 However, it’s intensified lately. I think the cause is my wife talked back to her once. Now, any little disagreement is magnified, leading to major disagreements. What can I do?","One choice is for you and your wife to decide together what are reasonable ways and expectations to have of your mother.From what you write it sounds like your wife and you have differences as to what is the proper and right way to talk with your mother.Once the both of you agree on overall philosophy and some specific details for examples, then ask your mother to make time for all three of you to discuss together the expectations and standards you and your wife would like to see happen.This is only the first step since it is possible and likely that at least on a few points, your mother will disagree and have different views.These need to be discussed and integrated into an overall plan which all three of you are happy to live with.","It’s challenging to navigate tensions between your wife and mother, especially when their relationship has become strained. Here are some steps you can take to help mediate and improve the situation:

### 1. **Stay Neutral and Avoid Taking Sides**
   - Your role is to be a mediator, not a judge. Avoid aligning with one side over the other, as this can escalate the conflict.
   - Listen to both perspectives without immediately defending or criticizing either party.

### 2. **Encourage Open Communication**
   - Suggest a calm and respectful conversation between your wife and mother, with you present to facilitate. Set ground rules, such as no interrupting, no personal attacks, and focusing on the issue at hand.
   - If a direct conversation feels too tense, consider writing letters or messages to express their feelings constructively.

### 3. **Address the Root Cause**
   - Identify the specific incident that intensified the conflict (e.g., your wife talking back). Acknowledge it and discuss how it made both parties feel.
   - Encourage them to focus on resolving the underlying issue rather than rehashing past grievances.

### 4. **Set Boundaries**
   - Help establish clear boundaries for both your wife and mother. For example, your mother might need to respect your wife’s independence, while your wife might need to be mindful of your mother’s feelings and communication style.
   - Boundaries can help prevent future misunderstandings and overstepping.

### 5. **Promote Empathy**
   - Encourage both your wife and mother to see things from each other’s perspective. For example, your mother might not realize how her actions come across as overbearing, and your wife might not understand how her behavior is perceived as lazy.
   - Remind them that they both care about you and want what’s best for your family.

### 6. **Limit Interactions Temporarily**
   - If tensions are too high, suggest a temporary break or reduction in interactions to allow everyone to cool off.
   - Use this time to reflect on how to rebuild the relationship in a healthier way.

### 7. **Seek Professional Help**
   - If the conflict persists or escalates, consider involving a family therapist or counselor. A neutral third party can help facilitate communication and provide tools for resolving conflicts.

### 8. **Be Patient**

2781,"I am on the track and softball team. My school is small, so I play all four sports it offers. I feel obligated to do track because I'm not a horrible runner, and my dad wants me to. The catch is is that the days before a track meet and the morning of, I get sick and cry.","It sounds like you are no longer committed to track emotionally.  It can be hard to talk to your dad about this, but he may think you love track and may not know you are getting so upset the days of meets.  An idea would be to first write a letter to your dad to see what feelings come out and then preparing to speak with him.  I think he will appreciate your honesty and maybe this conversation will bring you relief and also time to find something you really will enjoy.  ","It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy emotional and physical burden by participating in track, even though it’s causing you significant stress and discomfort. It’s important to acknowledge that your feelings are valid and worth addressing. Here are some steps you can take to navigate this situation:

### 1. **Understand Your Feelings**
   - Reflect on why track is causing you so much anxiety. Is it the pressure to perform? Fear of disappointing your dad? Or simply that you don’t enjoy it? Understanding the root cause can help you address it.

### 2. **Communicate with Your Dad**
   - Have an honest conversation with your dad about how track is affecting you. Let him know that while you appreciate his support, the sport is taking a toll on your mental and physical health. Emphasize that you’re still committed to being active and involved in other sports.

### 3. **Set Boundaries**
   - It’s okay to prioritize your well-being. If track is causing you this much distress, consider stepping back from it or reducing your involvement. You can explain to your coach and teammates that you’re focusing on other sports or activities that align better with your interests.

### 4. **Explore Alternatives**
   - If you feel obligated to stay active in a sport, see if there’s another option that excites you more. Even though your school only offers four sports, you might be able to find a club or community activity outside of school that aligns with your passions.

### 5. **Seek Support**
   - Talk to a trusted teacher, coach, or counselor about how you’re feeling. They can offer guidance and help you navigate this situation. If your anxiety feels overwhelming, consider speaking with a mental health professional.

### 6. **Focus on What You Enjoy**
   - It’s clear you’re a dedicated athlete, but it’s okay to prioritize the sports you genuinely enjoy. Softball and the other sports you’re involved in are just as valuable as track, and you don’t need to do everything to prove your worth.

### 7. **Practice Self-Compassion**
   - Remember, it’s okay to say no to something that doesn’t bring you joy or fulfillment. You’re not letting anyone down by prioritizing your mental and physical health.

It’s great that you’re so involved in sports, but it’s equally important to make sure those activities are serving you in a positive way. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to make changes that help you feel happier and healthier.",0.49668359756469727
2880,"I can't seem to feel any emotion except anxiety, not even for myself.","Empathy is the ability
to tap into our own experience to help us connect with others in order to be
aware of how they are experiencing life. 
It is a skill that we learn with practice and refine as we become mature.
If you are feeling anxious, maybe you are able to understand better others who
are going trough anxiety.  But I wonder
if instead of feeling empathy, you may just want to find ways to reduce your
anxiety.  A good idea is to be very aware
of your anxiety triggers, and once you identify them explore other ways you
could react. ¿Sera normal que no sienta empatía?Parece que no puedo experimentar ninguna otra emoción que

destreza interpersonal que aprendemos y refinamos con la práctica y según maduramos
como personas.  Si te estás sintiendo
ansioso, tal vez puedas comprender mejor como otra persona experimenta momentos

Feeling emotionally numb or disconnected, especially when paired with anxiety, can be overwhelming and isolating. Here are a few thoughts and suggestions that might help:

---

### 1. **Acknowledge What You’re Feeling**
   - It’s okay to feel this way. Emotions can sometimes shut down as a protective mechanism, especially if you’ve been dealing with prolonged stress or anxiety. Recognizing this as a valid experience can be the first step toward healing.

---

### 2. **Be Gentle with Yourself**
   - It’s easy to feel frustrated or critical of yourself for not feeling ""normal,"" but try to treat yourself with kindness. You’re doing the best you can in this moment, and that’s enough.

---

### 3. **Explore the Root of the Anxiety**
   - Anxiety can often overshadow other emotions, making it hard to feel anything else. Reflect on what might be contributing to your anxiety. Are there specific stressors, unresolved issues, or fears that need attention? Journaling or talking to someone you trust can help.

---

### 4. **Reconnect with Your Body and Senses**
   - When emotions feel out of reach, grounding yourself in your body can help. Try:
     - Deep breathing exercises or meditation.
     - Physical activity, like walking, stretching, or yoga.
     - Engaging your senses (e.g., holding something soft, listening to calming music, or focusing on a comforting scent).

---

### 5. **Seek Small Moments of Joy**
   - Even if you don’t feel emotions deeply right now, try engaging in activities that used to bring you comfort or joy. This could be listening to a favorite song, watching a comforting show, or spending time in nature. Sometimes, small moments can help break through the numbness.

---

### 6. **Reach Out for Support**
   - You don’t have to go through this alone. Talking to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist can provide relief and help you process what you’re feeling. A mental health professional can also help you explore tools and strategies tailored to your needs.

---

### 7. **Consider Professional Help**
   - If this numbness and anxiety persist, it might be helpful to consult a therapist or counselor. They can help you explore underlying causes and develop coping strategies. In some cases, medication (prescribed by a doctor) can also be helpful in managing anxiety.

---

### 8. **Remember That This Isn’t Permanent**
   - Emotions can feel stuck or inaccessible at times, but this doesn’t mean they’re gone forever. With time, support, and self-care, it’s possible to reconnect with your feelings and find relief from anxiety.

463,"Sometimes, I'm fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth. I've always thought it was normal and I was just nervous, but the other day, it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter Target by myself.","I would suggest keeping a log of those days when you are having a hard time. Items to write would be what were you doing before you felt this way, did you eat and what, what time of day is it, how much sleep did you get that night, etc... This can help you identify any triggers. Further assessment can be made by a health care professional. It does sound like you are experiencing some symptoms of anxiety.","What you're describing sounds like it could be related to **social anxiety** or **generalized anxiety**, which can manifest in different ways depending on the situation or your emotional state. It's not uncommon for anxiety to fluctuate—some days you might feel fine, while other days even seemingly simple tasks can feel overwhelming.

Here are a few things to consider:

1. **Anxiety Triggers**: Anxiety can be triggered by specific situations (like crowded places, unfamiliar environments, or social interactions) or even by internal factors like stress, fatigue, or uncertainty. Reflect on whether there are specific patterns or triggers that make these feelings worse.

2. **Physical Symptoms**: The racing heart, difficulty speaking, and the need to ""psych yourself up"" to do something like entering a store are common physical and emotional responses to anxiety. Your body might be going into a ""fight or flight"" mode, making it harder to feel calm or confident.

3. **Normal vs. Impactful**: While it's normal to feel nervous occasionally, if these feelings are happening frequently and interfering with your daily life (like making it hard to run errands or meet people), it might be worth exploring further.

4. **Coping Strategies**: There are ways to manage these feelings, such as:
   - **Breathing exercises**: Slow, deep breaths can help calm your nervous system.
   - **Gradual exposure**: Start with smaller, less intimidating tasks and work your way up to more challenging ones.
   - **Self-compassion**: Remind yourself that it's okay to feel this way and that you're not alone.

5. **Professional Support**: If these feelings are persistent or significantly impacting your life, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is particularly effective for anxiety, and a professional can help you develop personalized strategies.

1336,"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","It is challenging to see one's parents age and to cope with the new demands.  Your mom means a lot to you, and that is why you get easily frustrated.  I'm guessing that it is not that she is making you do work or that her expectations are non-important to you because if that were the case, you would not feel any guilt.  Accepting the new stage will help you cope with the changes.  Take a deep breath every time you feel frustrated and think of the good times you shared with your mom before her getting Alzheimer's.  Remember that your mom as she was is no longer and that she has reverted to a more delicate phase.  Also, schedule time for yourself and do things that help you relax.  Caretaking of an elderly parent can take a toll on you, and it is essential to incorporate self-care.  Finally, look for an Alzheimer's support group in your area that will help you connect with other people going through the same thing.  You are a good daughter, and your mom is lucky to have you in her life.Sincerely, Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling","Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease can be incredibly challenging, especially when their behavior changes in ways that feel hurtful or frustrating. It’s completely normal to feel a mix of emotions, including anger, guilt, and sadness. Here are some strategies to help you cope with these feelings and navigate this difficult situation:

### 1. **Educate Yourself About Alzheimer’s**
   - Understanding that the changes in your mother’s behavior are a result of the disease, not her true self, can help you reframe your reactions. Alzheimer’s affects the brain in ways that can lead to confusion, agitation, and personality changes.
   - Learn about the stages of Alzheimer’s and how it progresses. This knowledge can help you set realistic expectations and prepare for what might come next.

### 2. **Practice Empathy and Patience**
   - Remind yourself that your mother is not intentionally being mean or difficult. Her brain is struggling to process the world around her, and her behavior is a symptom of the disease.
   - Try to see her actions through the lens of her confusion or fear rather than as a personal attack.

### 3. **Adjust Your Expectations**
   - Let go of the idea that your mother will behave as she did before her diagnosis. Accepting her current reality can reduce frustration and help you focus on providing compassionate care.
   - When she asks for unrealistic or silly items, try to redirect her attention or gently explain why it’s not possible without arguing or correcting her.

### 4. **Take Care of Your Own Mental Health**
   - Caregiver burnout is real, and it’s essential to prioritize your well-being. Make time for activities that bring you joy or relaxation, even if it’s just a few minutes a day.
   - Consider joining a support group for caregivers of people with Alzheimer’s. Sharing your experiences with others who understand can be comforting and validating.

### 5. **Use Calming Techniques**
   - When you feel frustrated or angry, take a moment to breathe deeply or step away for a short break. Techniques like mindfulness, meditation, or journaling can help you process your emotions.
   - Remind yourself that it’s okay to feel upset—it’s how you handle those feelings that matters.

### 6. **Seek Professional Help**
   - If you’re struggling to cope, consider talking to a therapist or counselor who specializes in caregiver stress or grief. They can help you work through your emotions and develop coping strategies.
   - Consult your mother’s doctor about her behavior. They may be able to suggest medications or therapies to help manage her symptoms.

### 7. **Focus on the Positive Moments**
   - While Alzheimer’s can bring challenges, there may still be moments of connection or joy. Cherish those times, even if they’re small or fleeting.
   - Take photos, write down memories, or record conversations to hold onto the parts of your mother that remain.

### 8. **Ask for Help**
   - You don’t have to do this alone. Reach out to family members, friends, or professional caregivers to share the responsibilities.
   - Respite care services can give you a break while ensuring your mother is well cared for.

### 9. **Let Go of Guilt**
   - Feeling guilty is a natural part of caregiving, but try to remind yourself that you’re doing the best you can in a difficult situation.
   - Acknowledge your feelings without judgment, and remind yourself that it’s okay to have moments of frustration or anger.

### 10. **Celebrate Your Efforts**
   - Caring for someone with Alzheimer’s is a profound act of love, even when it doesn’t feel that way. Give yourself credit for the patience, compassion, and dedication you’re showing.

Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed at times, and seeking support is a sign of strength, not weakness. By taking care of yourself and finding ways to manage your emotions, you’ll be better equipped to care for your mother with kindness and understanding.",0.45043498277664185
1655,Why am I attracted to older men?,"What a wonderful question!Good for you on clearly knowing your priorities.If I was sitting with you now, I'd ask you to list your reasons.Start with whatever answers you do come up with and examine each of these a little further.If, for example, you feel you need a man because many of your friends are in relationships, then possibly you feel insecure about being your unique self, even when this sets you apart from your friends.If, you feel you need a man to protect you financially, then possibly you've lost faith in your ability to financially support yourself.If you'd like a man in your life to offer your love and are willing to contribute the work of relating intimately, then you've found the best reason for wanting a man in your life.This is far different than ""need"".","Attraction to older men is a common and natural experience for many people, and it can stem from a variety of factors, including psychological, social, and biological influences. Here are some possible reasons why you might feel drawn to older men:

### 1. **Emotional Maturity and Stability**
   - Older men are often perceived as more emotionally mature, stable, and confident. They may have life experience that allows them to handle relationships with greater patience and understanding, which can be appealing.

### 2. **Life Experience and Wisdom**
   - Older men may have a wealth of life experience, knowledge, and wisdom that can be intellectually stimulating or comforting. Their ability to offer guidance or share perspectives can create a sense of security and admiration.

### 3. **Financial Stability**
   - Older men are often more established in their careers and may have greater financial stability, which can provide a sense of security and reduce stress in a relationship.

### 4. **Parental or Authority Figure Influence**
   - Psychological theories suggest that attraction to older individuals may sometimes be linked to unconscious associations with parental or authority figures. If you had a positive relationship with an older male figure in your life (e.g., a father, mentor, or teacher), this could influence your preferences.

### 5. **Social Conditioning**
   - Cultural norms and media often portray relationships with older men as desirable, emphasizing traits like protection, leadership, and sophistication. These portrayals can shape personal preferences and ideals.

### 6. **Biological Factors**
   - Some evolutionary psychologists suggest that women may be naturally inclined to seek older partners because they are perceived as better providers and protectors, which could enhance survival and well-being.

### 7. **Shared Values and Interests**
   - Older men may share your values, interests, or lifestyle preferences, creating a sense of compatibility and connection.

### 8. **Desire for a Mentor or Guide**
   - You might be drawn to older men because you see them as mentors or guides who can help you navigate life challenges or personal growth.

### 9. **Personal Preferences and Chemistry**
   - Attraction is deeply personal and can be influenced by unique preferences, chemistry, or the specific qualities you find appealing in an individual, regardless of age.

### 10. **Life Stage Differences**
   - If you’re in a different life stage than your peers, you might feel more aligned with someone older who shares your goals or outlook on life.

It’s important to remember that attraction is complex and deeply personal. There’s no right or wrong reason to be attracted to someone, as long as the relationship is healthy, consensual, and fulfilling for both partners. If you’re curious about your preferences, reflecting on your experiences, values, and desires can help you better understand what draws you to older men.",0.4764288663864136
51,"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",You can be helped. Many of the people I see have multiple issues. These issues are often linked so that helping one issue will positively help the other issues.,"First, I want to acknowledge the strength and resilience it takes to reflect on your experiences and consider seeking support. You’ve been through so much, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed. The good news is that counseling is designed to help people address complex and layered challenges like the ones you’ve described.

Here are a few key points to consider:

1. **You don’t have too many issues for counseling.** Therapists are trained to work with individuals who have multifaceted histories and struggles. While it may feel like you have a lot to unpack, a skilled therapist can help you prioritize and address these issues in a way that feels manageable. You don’t have to tackle everything at once—counseling is a process, and it’s okay to take it step by step.

2. **Your experiences are interconnected.** Trauma, health challenges, mental health struggles, and self-esteem often overlap and influence one another. A therapist can help you explore these connections and develop strategies to heal and build resilience. For example, addressing the trauma of sexual abuse may help alleviate some of the anxiety or low self-esteem you’re experiencing.

3. **Counseling can be tailored to your needs.** Therapists use different approaches depending on your goals and concerns. For instance, trauma-focused therapies like EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) or CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) can be effective for addressing past abuse and anxiety. Other modalities, like mindfulness-based therapy, might help with insomnia and stress management.

4. **Your marriage is a strength.** The fact that you’ve been happily married for 35 years shows that you have a strong foundation of support and connection. This can be a valuable resource as you work through your challenges in counseling.

5. **Starting counseling is a brave step.** It’s never too late to seek help, and doing so is a sign of self-care and courage. Many people find that counseling helps them feel less alone, more understood, and better equipped to navigate life’s challenges.

If you’re feeling unsure about where to start, consider reaching out to a therapist who specializes in trauma, depression, or anxiety.

He should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case, and I don’t want to hurt him.","While not wanting to be alone may not be the best reason to be in a relationship, it is probably more common and normal a reason than you think.  Since you seem to care about your friend (""don't want to hurt him""), I imagine there are many other reasons that you are together.  I suggest that you talk about this open-heartedly with each other.  The idea of being afraid of being alone sounds like an honest starting place.  Don't try to ""figure out"" whether you should be with him.  Just talk.  The communication is likely to shine light on deepening connection for BOTH OF YOU.In the meantime, your idea that you don't deserve him is rooted in a ""core lie"" that you are telling yourself.  You can read about ""core lies"" and much more in my book, Living Yes, a Handbook for Being Human.  Check out www.LivingYes.org.Be easy on yourself.  You are deserving!~Mark","It’s really brave of you to reflect on your feelings and consider how they might affect both you and him. It sounds like you’re being thoughtful and compassionate, which shows how much you care about him and yourself. Let’s break this down:

1. **Your Fear of Being Alone**: It’s completely natural to fear loneliness, and many people stay in relationships because of this fear. But being in a relationship out of fear, rather than genuine love and connection, can lead to unhappiness for both of you in the long run. It’s important to ask yourself: Are you with him because you truly want to be, or because you’re afraid of being alone? 

2. **Deserving Him**: The idea of “deserving” someone can be tricky. Relationships aren’t about one person being “worthy” of the other—they’re about mutual respect, care, and compatibility. If you’re worried you’re not giving him what he deserves, it might be worth exploring whether you’re truly happy in the relationship or if there’s something you feel is missing.

3. **Hurting Him**: It’s clear you care deeply about him and don’t want to cause him pain. But staying in a relationship that isn’t fulfilling for you could hurt both of you more over time. Honesty and open communication are key. If you’re feeling unsure, it might be helpful to talk to him about your feelings in a kind and gentle way.

4. **What You Deserve**: While you’re thinking about what he deserves, don’t forget to think about what *you* deserve. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel secure, loved, and valued for who you are. If this relationship isn’t meeting those needs, it’s okay to reassess.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed, it might help to talk to a trusted friend, family member, or even a therapist. They can offer support and help you sort through your feelings.

   *""Had a really great time last night. Hope your day is off to a good start!""*  

2. **Timing**: Sending a message the same day is perfectly fine, especially if you want to keep the momentum going. It doesn’t need to be immediate—wait until you feel ready or until you’re settled into your day.

3. **Calling** could work if you’re comfortable with it and feel like having a conversation, but texting is usually easier and less intrusive, especially if he’s busy.

4. **Be Yourself**: Keep it genuine and aligned with your usual communication style. If you’re excited to see him again, you could even suggest making plans for the future.

   What is wrong with me, and how can I stop having these thoughts?","Many people have thoughts like those you describe, and often it feels like someone else is saying it because they are things that may have been said to you when you were very young.  When young children hear negative things about themselves they tend to internalize these negative ideas and to form negative core beliefs.  The good news is we can learn to stop these thoughts and to replace them with healthier thoughts.  The first step is to catch yourself when you are thinking these thoughts, and to stay ""stop!""; then replace it with another thought.  So for instance, maybe you fail a test or get rejected by a romantic interest.  You catch yourself saying ""you aren't worth anything"". Stop this thought, and replace it with ""You didn't do as well on that test as you would have liked.  Let's figure out how you can do better next time.""  Or ""she may not want to go out with you, but someone else will"".

You're not alone in this, and there’s nothing inherently ""wrong"" with you. What you're describing can be a common experience for many people, and it’s often related to how our minds process stress, self-criticism, or negative beliefs we’ve internalized over time.

Here’s what might be happening and how you can work on managing these thoughts:

---

### **What’s Happening?**
1. **Intrusive Thoughts**: These are unwanted, repetitive thoughts that can feel intrusive or overwhelming. They often arise from anxiety, stress, or unresolved emotions.
2. **Internalized Criticism**: If you’ve experienced criticism (from others or yourself) in the past, it can manifest as these negative, automatic thoughts.
3. **Cognitive Distortions**: These are patterns of thinking that are inaccurate or unhelpful, such as catastrophizing, black-and-white thinking, or overgeneralizing (e.g., ""I’m not worth anything"").
4. **Mind-Body Connection**: Stress, fatigue, or hormonal changes can sometimes make these thoughts more frequent or intense.

---

### **How to Manage These Thoughts**
1. **Recognize and Label the Thoughts**:
   - When these thoughts arise, remind yourself: ""This is just a thought, not a fact."" Labeling them as ""intrusive"" or ""unhelpful"" can help you detach from them.
   - Example: Instead of thinking, ""I’m not worth anything,"" say, ""I’m having the thought that I’m not worth anything.""

2. **Challenge the Thoughts**:
   - Ask yourself: ""Is this thought true? What evidence do I have for or against it?""
   - Replace the thought with a more balanced one. For example, ""I’m not perfect, but I have value and worth.""

3. **Practice Self-Compassion**:
   - Treat yourself with the same kindness you’d offer a friend. When you notice these thoughts, say something like, ""This is hard, but I’m doing my best.""
   - Write down things you appreciate about yourself or moments when you’ve felt proud of your actions.

4. **Mindfulness and Meditation**:
   - Mindfulness helps you observe your thoughts without judgment. Practices like meditation or deep breathing can create space between you and your thoughts, reducing their intensity.
   - Apps like Calm, Headspace, or Insight Timer can guide you.

5. **Limit Stress and Take Care of Your Body**:
   - Ensure you’re getting enough sleep, eating well, and exercising regularly. Physical health has a big impact on mental health.
   - Identify and reduce sources of stress in your life, if possible.

6. **Seek Support**:
   - Talk to someone you trust, like a friend, family member, or therapist. Sometimes, sharing these thoughts can help you feel less alone.
   - A therapist can help you explore the root causes of these thoughts and develop strategies to manage them. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is particularly effective for this.

7. **Create a Positive Environment**:
   - Surround yourself with positive influences—people, activities, or media that uplift you.
   - Practice gratitude by writing down three things you’re grateful for each day.

### **When to Seek Professional Help**
If these thoughts are persistent, overwhelming, or interfering with your daily life, it’s important to reach out to a mental health professional. They can help you determine if there’s an underlying condition (like anxiety, depression, or OCD) and provide tailored support.

2746,"I'm a guy. If I don't like girls, nor do I like guys, does that mean I'm gay?","Hi, and thanks for your question. I agree with my colleagues about researching asexuality, but I want too add a couple of things about that:Here is a website that you can start with to get some information about asexuality - http://www.asexuality.org/home/There are a whole lot of myths surrounding asexuality. One is that people who are asexual have absolutely no interest in sex, and that is not always the case. There are variations of asexuality. Some people who are asexual have an interest in sex and others don't. Also, once you read more on this topic, you may find that you don't connect with asexuality either, and that is okay. Our society usually thinks of sexual orientations as only being straight, gay, lesbian, or bisexual, but the truth is there are many variations of sexual orientations. Keep exploring. There is a good chance that there is a community of people who feel like you do. Finally, labels are important for a lot of things, but labeling ourselves can sometimes lead to some painful feelings. Try not to feel pressured to label yourself too quickly. This is your journey. Your experience. Take all the time you need. You may never feel the need to label how you feel, and that is okay, too. Hope this helps. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC  ","No, if you don't feel attracted to girls or guys, it doesn't mean you're gay. It could mean you identify as **asexual**, which is a sexual orientation characterized by a lack of sexual attraction to others. Asexuality is a valid and diverse identity, and it doesn't necessarily mean someone is gay, straight, or bisexual. It simply means you don't experience sexual attraction in the same way others might.

Sexuality is complex and personal, and there are many ways to describe how you feel. If you're unsure or curious, exploring labels like asexual, aromantic (lack of romantic attraction), or other identities might help you better understand yourself. Remember, it's okay to not fit into traditional categories—what matters most is how you feel and how you define yourself.",0.4874258041381836
2792,"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years. I have been on medication, but lately my depression has felt worse. Can counseling help?","Thank you for asking this important question. I find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment. Step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change. Congratulations you did the first step! You are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question. Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression. The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with  Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events. Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression.  The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment. As counselors, we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time. However, remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well being. I hope this was helpful, and good luck with your treatment journey. ","I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, and I want to acknowledge how difficult it must be to navigate these challenges. It’s important to know that you’re not alone, and there are ways to find support and relief.

Counseling can absolutely help with depression and anxiety, and it’s often a valuable complement to medication. Here’s how counseling might be beneficial:

1. **Providing a Safe Space**: Counseling offers a nonjudgmental environment where you can openly express your thoughts and feelings. This can be incredibly validating and relieving.

2. **Identifying Triggers and Patterns**: A counselor can help you explore the underlying causes of your depression and anxiety, as well as identify patterns or triggers that might be contributing to your symptoms.

3. **Teaching Coping Skills**: Counseling often focuses on practical strategies to manage symptoms, such as mindfulness, relaxation techniques, or cognitive-behavioral tools to challenge negative thought patterns.

4. **Offering Support and Accountability**: A counselor can provide consistent support and help you set and work toward meaningful goals, which can be empowering during difficult times.

5. **Adjusting Treatment Plans**: If your depression has worsened, a counselor can work with you (and potentially your prescribing doctor) to reassess your treatment plan and explore additional options.

It’s also worth noting that counseling can be tailored to your specific needs. Different approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), or psychodynamic therapy, might be more or less effective depending on your situation. Finding the right counselor and approach can make a big difference.

If you’re considering counseling, here are a few steps to get started:
- **Reach Out to a Professional**: Look for a licensed therapist or counselor who specializes in depression and anxiety.
- **Be Open About Your Experience**: Share your history, including your medication and how you’ve been feeling lately, so they can tailor their approach.
- **Give It Time**: Counseling is a process, and it may take a few sessions to feel the benefits.

Lastly, if your depression feels significantly worse, it’s important to reach out to your prescribing doctor or a mental health professional as soon as possible. They can help ensure your medication is still appropriate or make adjustments if needed.

You’re taking a brave step by considering counseling, and it’s a sign of strength to seek help. Healing is possible, and you deserve support on this journey.",0.46304643154144287
1993,"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","Thank you for sharing your question.  I imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session.  I would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals.  For example, a list of goals may look similar to this:1.  ""I will learn about the effects of medication on the symptoms of depression and anxiety.""2.  ""I will learn about the factors that affect insomnia.""3.  ""I will learn about resources and support groups in my local area to help me cope with my traumatic experiences.""4.  ""I will practice self-care exercises each day and write about my thoughts and feelings in a journal so I can measure whether or not I""m making progress.""This is an example of some of the possible goals a counselor can help you work toward each week.  Working toward a specific goal can lead to a feeling of accomplishment once you've completed it, and this may have a positive impact on your self-esteem.  I hope this information helps, and I wish you all the best!","First, I want to acknowledge the strength and resilience it takes to carry so much while still maintaining a long and happy marriage. It’s clear you’ve been through a lot, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed. The good news is that counseling is designed to help people with complex and layered experiences like yours. You do **not** have too many issues to address in counseling—in fact, counseling can be a safe and supportive space to untangle and process these challenges.

Here’s why counseling can be helpful for you:

1. **Holistic Approach**: A skilled therapist will work with you to prioritize your concerns and address them in a way that feels manageable. You don’t have to tackle everything at once—therapy can be a gradual process.

2. **Trauma-Informed Care**: If you’ve experienced sexual abuse, a therapist trained in trauma can help you process those experiences in a way that feels safe and empowering.

3. **Coping with Health Challenges**: As a breast cancer survivor, you may have unresolved emotions or fears related to your health. Counseling can help you process these feelings and build resilience.

4. **Sleep and Mental Health**: Insomnia, depression, and anxiety often intersect. A therapist can help you explore the root causes of these issues and develop strategies to improve your sleep and mental well-being.

5. **Self-Esteem and Identity**: Low self-esteem can be deeply rooted, but therapy can help you challenge negative beliefs about yourself and build a stronger sense of self-worth.

6. **Support for Anxiety**: If anxiety is becoming more prominent, therapy can provide tools to manage it effectively.

7. **Long-Term Perspective**: With 35 years of marriage, you’ve clearly built a strong foundation. Therapy can help you explore how your past and current struggles may be impacting your relationship and how to strengthen it further.

### How to Get Started:
- **Find the Right Therapist**: Look for a therapist who specializes in trauma, chronic illness, and mental health. You might consider someone who uses evidence-based approaches like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) for trauma, or mindfulness-based techniques.
- **Take It Step by Step**: You don’t have to share everything at once. Therapy is a process, and you can go at your own pace.
- **Be Patient with Yourself**: Healing is not linear, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. Celebrate small victories along the way.

### Remember:
You’ve already shown incredible strength by surviving and thriving through so much. Seeking counseling is a courageous step toward healing and growth. You deserve support, and it’s never too late to start. You’re not alone in this journey, and with the right help, you can find relief and clarity.",0.4397650957107544
2412,"I broke up with him three weeks ago because I felt that he needed to be more respectful. He has since had a rebound relationship. He says he loves and misses me but refuses to see me. He says it's going to be too difficult to see me. Every time we talk, it feels like I'm being pushy to see him. He used to be so madly in love with me, but now, it seems like he couldn’t care less. I think I'm running him away.","Hi Kansas,I think your first instinct was good; you broke up with him. You deserve respect, but right now you're not acting as if you deserve it when you push to see him as he's moving on with a new relationship. It's appropriate now for you to respect that relationship and listen to what he says he wants, which is space. Do you think he's going to be any different with her? This a common, unfounded fear we have. I wonder if maybe you miss the feeling of being in love and having a partner more than you miss him. The bottom line is you can't make someone love you, and you can't make someone be loving towards you, because how someone treats you (and the choices they make) has everything to do with who they are, and nothing to do with who you are. I hope you gather support from others and move on in hope and strength for your own future.","It sounds like you're in a really tough emotional space right now, and I’m sorry you’re going through this. Breakups are incredibly painful, especially when there are lingering feelings and mixed signals. Here are a few things to consider as you navigate this situation:

### 1. **Respect His Boundaries**
   - He’s told you that seeing you would be too difficult for him right now. While it’s hard to hear, it’s important to respect his feelings and give him the space he’s asking for. Pushing to see him or reconnect might create more distance and make him feel pressured.

### 2. **Focus on Yourself**
   - It’s natural to want answers or closure, but right now, the best thing you can do is focus on your own healing. Take time to process your emotions, lean on friends and family for support, and engage in activities that bring you joy or peace. This will help you regain clarity and strength.

### 3. **Reflect on the Breakup**
   - You ended the relationship because you felt he needed to be more respectful. Reflect on whether those issues were resolved or if they might resurface if you were to reconcile. It’s easy to romanticize the past when you’re missing someone, but it’s important to remember why you made the decision you did.

### 4. **Avoid Overanalyzing His Actions**
   - His rebound relationship and his current behavior might be confusing, but try not to overanalyze them. People often act out of pain, confusion, or a desire to avoid their emotions after a breakup. His actions may not necessarily reflect his true feelings or long-term intentions.

### 5. **Consider Letting Go**
   - If he’s not ready or willing to reconnect, it might be time to start letting go. Holding onto hope for reconciliation can prolong your pain. Letting go doesn’t mean you stop caring—it means you prioritize your own well-being and open yourself up to new possibilities.

### 6. **Communicate Clearly (If Needed)**
   - If you feel the need to express your feelings or seek clarity, do so in a calm and respectful way. For example, you could say, “I understand you need space, but I want you to know how I feel and what I’m hoping for.” Be prepared for any response, including the possibility that he may not be ready to engage.

### 7. **Give It Time**
   - Emotions after a breakup can be volatile and change over time. What feels true for him now might not be true in the future. However, don’t wait around for him to change his mind—focus on moving forward for your own sake.

### 8. **Seek Support**
   - If you’re struggling to cope, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you process your emotions and develop healthy strategies for moving forward.

Remember, you deserve a relationship where you feel respected and valued. Whether that’s with him or someone else, prioritizing your own happiness and well-being is the most important thing right now.",0.5191110372543335
2328,"My dad cheated on my mom for 13 years. I cannot stop obsessing over the fact that my boyfriend might be cheating on me even when I know he isn't. I have full access to his phone, social media, and e-mails. I never find anything, but I'm obsessed with constantly checking just in case. How do I stop this? It's driving a wedge between us.","Hi Greenville, I respect that you're owning your own overreactions, and that you want to give your boyfriend the respect he deserves. The truth is that some people cheat, and some don't, and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they can't be trusted.The answer here is in two different areas. Basically, if you want to feel differently (more trusting, in your case), you look at your thoughts, and your behaviours.Your thoughts are stuck... like tires in deep ruts in the road. These thoughts are only habits, they don't reflect the truth. Fear is probably whispering in your ear things like ""everyone cheats"", or "" you're not enough for him"". Once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you, picture those words in red next time they come up. Ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought (there won't be much...perhaps none), and what is the evidence that doesn't support it (I know lots of good men, I know I deserve love and loyalty, there is no sign of infidelity...). You're learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear. That's the first half. Practise these thoughts.The rest of the work is in your behaviours. Act as though you trust him. Force yourself to not check or interrogate, and the less you check, the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel. Acting ""as if"" something if true strangely helps us believe it.It's possible to change the way we think, and this is turn changes the way we feel. Try this to start, and see a therapist for support and cognitive behavioural therapy if you want to dive more deeply into why this is happening and how to stop it. Good luck!","I’m so sorry you’re going through this. It’s completely understandable that your dad’s infidelity has left a deep emotional scar, and it’s natural for those feelings to spill over into your current relationship. What you’re experiencing is a trauma response, and while it’s valid, it’s also important to address it so it doesn’t continue to harm your relationship or your well-being. Here are some steps to help you work through this:

### 1. **Acknowledge the Root Cause**
   - Recognize that your fear of being cheated on stems from your dad’s betrayal, not from anything your boyfriend has done. Understanding this can help you separate past trauma from your present reality.

### 2. **Communicate with Your Boyfriend**
   - Be open with your boyfriend about your feelings and why you’re struggling. Let him know it’s not about mistrusting him but about the lingering pain from your past. This can help him understand and support you rather than feel attacked.

### 3. **Set Boundaries for Yourself**
   - Gradually reduce the frequency of checking his phone, social media, or emails. Start by setting a limit (e.g., once a day, then once a week) and stick to it. Replace the urge to check with a healthier coping mechanism, like journaling or deep breathing.

### 4. **Challenge Your Thoughts**
   - When you feel the urge to check, pause and ask yourself: *Is this fear based on evidence or my past trauma?* Remind yourself that your boyfriend has given you no reason to doubt him and that your dad’s actions don’t define all relationships.

### 5. **Build Trust Gradually**
   - Focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the ways your boyfriend has shown his loyalty. Trust is built over time, and allowing yourself to lean into that trust can help ease your anxiety.

### 6. **Seek Professional Support**
   - Consider talking to a therapist, especially one who specializes in trauma or relationship issues. They can help you process your dad’s betrayal and develop healthier coping strategies.

### 7. **Practice Self-Compassion**
   - Be kind to yourself. Healing from betrayal takes time, and it’s okay to struggle. Remind yourself that you’re doing your best to work through this.

### 8. **Focus on the Present**
   - Try mindfulness techniques to ground yourself in the present moment. When you feel overwhelmed by fear, remind yourself that your current relationship is different from your parents’ and that you have the power to shape it in a positive way.

### 9. **Engage in Activities That Build Confidence**
   - Invest time in hobbies, friendships, or self-care activities that make you feel good about yourself. Building your self-esteem can help reduce the fear of being betrayed.

### 10. **Consider Couples Therapy**
   - If the issue continues to strain your relationship, couples therapy can provide a safe space to work through these challenges together.

Remember, healing is a process, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. You’re not alone in this, and with time and effort, you can overcome these fears and build a stronger, healthier relationship.",0.42758113145828247
605,"I'm being verbally abused on a daily basis by my parents in front of my child. I feel like I’m trapped and I have no escape. I feel like I have to listen to the horrible things they say and just take all of it.
   I need some way of learning how to cope with listening to it especially since I have nowhere else to go. I feel very emotionally drained How can I deal with this?","Hello, I am sorry to hear about you feeling verbally abused, trapped without an escape, and emotionally drained. Sounds to me like you are being treated more like a child than an adult.  It's time to learn about healthy boundaries and being treated like an adult. This process will take time, but beyond elevating your self-esteem and worth, you will be modeling to your children a healthy adult. Model to them an empowered, confident, and person that is worthy of respect. Please invest in yourself. Find yourself a therapist that encourages and empowers you to have a voice and not feel invisible. You'll be so glad you did!","I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Being verbally abused is incredibly painful, especially when it happens in front of your child and when you feel trapped. It’s important to acknowledge that this situation is not your fault, and you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. Here are some steps to help you cope and navigate this difficult situation:

---

### **1. Protect Your Mental and Emotional Well-Being**
- **Set Internal Boundaries**: Remind yourself that their words are a reflection of them, not you. Try to detach emotionally from their hurtful comments. Repeat affirmations like, “I am not what they say,” or “I am strong and deserving of respect.”
- **Practice Grounding Techniques**: When the abuse happens, focus on your breathing or a calming object (e.g., a piece of jewelry or a photo) to stay present and reduce emotional overwhelm.
- **Create a Safe Space in Your Mind**: Imagine a place where you feel safe and at peace. Visualize it during moments of abuse to mentally escape.

---

### **2. Seek Emotional Support**
- **Talk to Someone You Trust**: Share your feelings with a friend, family member, or counselor. Even if they can’t physically help, having someone listen can be incredibly validating.
- **Join a Support Group**: Look for online or local support groups for people experiencing abuse or difficult family dynamics. Hearing others’ stories can help you feel less alone.
- **Consider Therapy**: If possible, seek professional help. A therapist can provide coping strategies and help you process your emotions in a safe space.

---

### **3. Protect Your Child**
- **Model Healthy Responses**: Show your child how to stay calm and composed in difficult situations. This can help them feel more secure.
- **Explain the Situation (Age-Appropriately)**: If your child is old enough, reassure them that the abusive behavior is not their fault and that you’re doing your best to keep them safe.
- **Create a Safe Space for Your Child**: Spend quality time with your child in a calm environment, engaging in activities that bring joy and comfort to both of you.

---

### **4. Develop an Exit Plan**
Even if you feel trapped now, it’s important to start thinking about long-term solutions:
- **Explore Housing Options**: Research shelters, transitional housing, or assistance programs in your area. Organizations like domestic violence shelters or social services may be able to help.
- **Save Money**: If possible, start setting aside funds to secure your independence.
- **Build a Support Network**: Reach out to friends, family, or community organizations that might be able to offer temporary housing or other resources.

---

### **5. Document the Abuse**
- **Keep a Record**: Write down incidents of abuse, including dates, times, and what was said or done. This can be useful if you need to seek legal or professional help in the future.
- **Seek Legal Advice**: If the abuse escalates or becomes physical, consider consulting a lawyer or local legal aid organization to understand your rights and options.

---

### **6. Practice Self-Care**
- **Take Small Breaks**: Find moments to step away, even if it’s just for a few minutes, to breathe and collect yourself.
- **Engage in Activities You Enjoy**: Even in small doses, doing something you love (reading, listening to music, crafting) can help lift your spirits.
- **Prioritize Rest**: Abuse can be emotionally exhausting. Try to get enough sleep and eat nourishing meals to maintain your strength.

---

### **7. Know You’re Not Alone**
Many people have been in similar situations and found ways to heal and rebuild their lives. You are stronger than you think, and there are resources and people who can help you. You don’t have to face this alone.

1459,What makes a healthy marriage last?,"In my mind, a healthy marriage has two participants, meaning both people participate equally in the intimate connection of marriage. An unequal participation comes in many forms, such as one person checking out of conversations when it becomes emotional, or speaking over and for each other in these conversations. Couple’s should strive for engagement and support, but doing it in a way that works for each person individually. I hope this helps.","A healthy, lasting marriage is built on a foundation of mutual respect, trust, communication, and commitment. While every relationship is unique, there are several key factors that contribute to a strong and enduring marriage:

### 1. **Effective Communication**
   - Open and honest communication is essential. Partners should feel safe expressing their thoughts, feelings, and needs without fear of judgment or criticism.
   - Active listening is equally important—truly hearing and understanding your partner’s perspective fosters connection and empathy.

### 2. **Trust and Honesty**
   - Trust is the cornerstone of a healthy marriage. Being reliable, keeping promises, and maintaining transparency builds a sense of security.
   - Honesty, even when it’s difficult, strengthens the relationship and prevents resentment.

### 3. **Mutual Respect**
   - Respecting each other’s individuality, boundaries, and opinions is crucial. Valuing your partner as an equal fosters a sense of partnership.
   - Avoid belittling, criticizing, or dismissing each other’s feelings.

### 4. **Commitment**
   - A lasting marriage requires a shared commitment to work through challenges together. Viewing the relationship as a priority and being willing to invest time and effort is key.
   - This includes staying committed even during difficult times or when feelings fluctuate.

### 5. **Emotional Intimacy**
   - Emotional closeness—feeling understood, supported, and connected—is vital. Sharing vulnerabilities, dreams, and fears deepens the bond.
   - Regularly expressing love, appreciation, and affection strengthens emotional intimacy.

### 6. **Shared Values and Goals**
   - Having common values, beliefs, and long-term goals helps align partners and creates a sense of teamwork.
   - While differences are natural, finding ways to compromise and support each other’s aspirations is important.

### 7. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Disagreements are normal, but how they’re handled matters. Healthy couples address conflicts constructively, focusing on solutions rather than blame.
   - Avoiding destructive behaviors like yelling, name-calling, or stonewalling is essential.

### 8. **Quality Time Together**
   - Spending meaningful time together strengthens the relationship. This could include shared hobbies, date nights, or simply enjoying each other’s company.
   - Prioritizing the relationship amidst life’s demands helps maintain connection.

### 9. **Flexibility and Adaptability**
   - Life brings changes, and a healthy marriage requires flexibility. Being willing to adapt to new circumstances and grow together is crucial.
   - Accepting that both partners will evolve over time fosters resilience.

### 10. **Support and Encouragement**
   - Being each other’s biggest cheerleader creates a positive and nurturing environment. Celebrate successes and offer support during challenges.
   - Encouraging personal growth and self-care benefits both partners and the relationship.

### 11. **Forgiveness and Letting Go**
   - Holding onto grudges can erode a marriage. Learning to forgive and move forward after mistakes or misunderstandings is essential.
   - Focus on the bigger picture and prioritize the relationship over minor grievances.

### 12. **Physical Intimacy**
   - Physical affection, including touch, intimacy, and closeness, plays a role in maintaining connection and bonding.
   - Open communication about needs and desires ensures both partners feel fulfilled.

### 13. **Shared Responsibilities**
   - Equitably sharing responsibilities, whether financial, household, or parenting, reduces stress and fosters teamwork.
   - Discussing and agreeing on roles prevents resentment and imbalance.

### 14. **Maintaining Individuality**
   - While marriage is a partnership, it’s important for each person to maintain their own identity, interests, and friendships.
   - Supporting each other’s personal growth enhances the relationship.

### 15. **Seeking Help When Needed**
   - Recognizing when outside help is needed—such as counseling or therapy—shows strength and commitment to the relationship.
   - Professional guidance can provide tools to navigate challenges and improve communication.

Ultimately, a lasting marriage is a dynamic and evolving partnership that requires ongoing effort, love, and understanding. By nurturing these elements, couples can build a strong, resilient, and fulfilling relationship.",0.5420387387275696
3235,"I know that I need to get past my feelings for this person I fell in love with, but t's so difficult to move on because he showed me feelings I've never felt before. 

I feel like I don't  want to be without my genuine love for him, but logically, I know I need to be without him. I can't discuss this with anybody in my life because the conditions surrounding our love are considered  ""wrong"" by a lot of people.

How can I get myself to just move on?","It's difficult to move on and let go, especially when you've experienced things for the first time with someone, or feelings you've never felt before, as you said.I like the fact that you are looking at your situation ""logically"".  Feelings can take time to fade, but you seem to understand, even if it is subconsciously, that it's the feelings he stirred up in you that are keeping you tied to him, not necessarily the person himself. Realize that you can and will experience those feelings again with another person - the RIGHT person. Don't hold onto someone who is wrong for you just because of something like this. You're wanting those feelings and wanting a relationship - but with him necessarily? Or with anybody? You said you don't want to be without your love for him - not you don't want to be without him. In fact, you said you know you need to be without him. It seems like it's the LOVE that you can't let go of, and the feelings. Not the person. Trust me, you will find that again. Take some time to let this fade. Don't try to force him or anyone else into a role that is meant for someone else. Cherish the memories and the experiences you had. Sounds like it's been a valuable learning and growth experience for you, but you have your own reasons, and I don't know what they are, for thinking this person isn't good for you.

But all shape you into the person you are and will become, and all teach us important lessons.","Moving on from someone you deeply love, especially when the circumstances are complicated or deemed ""wrong"" by others, is incredibly challenging. It’s a process that takes time, self-compassion, and intentional effort. Here are some steps to help you navigate this difficult journey:

---

### 1. **Acknowledge and Accept Your Feelings**
   - It’s okay to feel love for someone, even if the relationship isn’t possible or healthy. Suppressing your emotions will only make the process harder. Allow yourself to grieve the loss of what you hoped for.
   - Write down your feelings in a journal or express them through art or music. This can help you process what you’re going through in a safe, private way.

---

### 2. **Understand Why You Need to Move On**
   - Remind yourself of the reasons why being with this person isn’t feasible or healthy. Whether it’s external circumstances, incompatibility, or harm it could cause, focus on the logical reasons for letting go.
   - Write a list of these reasons and revisit it whenever you feel tempted to romanticize the relationship.

---

### 3. **Create Distance**
   - Limit or cut off contact with this person, at least temporarily. Staying in touch will only prolong the pain and make it harder to move on.
   - Unfollow or mute them on social media to avoid constant reminders of their presence.

---

### 4. **Focus on Yourself**
   - Redirect the energy you’ve been investing in this relationship into your own growth and well-being. Pursue hobbies, set personal goals, or explore new interests.
   - Practice self-care by prioritizing your physical, emotional, and mental health. This could include exercise, meditation, therapy, or spending time with supportive friends.

---

### 5. **Challenge Idealization**
   - It’s easy to idealize someone when you’re in love, but try to see the situation realistically. Reflect on any flaws or challenges in the relationship that you may have overlooked.
   - Remind yourself that while the feelings were genuine, they don’t necessarily mean this person was the right fit for you long-term.

---

### 6. **Seek Support (If Possible)**
   - While you may not feel comfortable discussing the specifics with people in your life, consider confiding in a trusted friend, therapist, or support group. Talking about your feelings can help you feel less alone.
   - If therapy isn’t an option, online forums or anonymous platforms can provide a safe space to share your thoughts.

---

### 7. **Give Yourself Time**
   - Healing isn’t linear, and it’s normal to have good days and bad days. Be patient with yourself and trust that the intensity of your feelings will lessen over time.
   - Set small, achievable goals for moving forward, and celebrate your progress along the way.

---

### 8. **Focus on the Future**
   - Remind yourself that there are other people and experiences out there that can bring you happiness and fulfillment. This doesn’t mean you have to rush into a new relationship, but try to stay open to the possibilities life has to offer.
   - Visualize the kind of love and life you truly want, and work toward creating that for yourself.

---

### 9. **Practice Gratitude**
   - While it’s painful to let go, try to be grateful for the positive aspects of the experience. This person may have shown you new depths of emotion or taught you something valuable about yourself.
   - Gratitude can help shift your focus from what you’ve lost to what you’ve gained.

---

### 10. **Be Kind to Yourself**
   - Moving on doesn’t mean you have to stop loving this person entirely. It means choosing to prioritize your own well-being and creating a life that doesn’t revolve around them.

Letting go of someone you love is one of the hardest things you’ll ever do, but it’s also an opportunity for growth and self-discovery. Take it one day at a time, and trust that with time and effort, you’ll find peace and happiness again. You’re stronger than you think.",0.4853708744049072
2406,"I have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and I just had my first kiss five months ago. I’m worried that, at this rate, I won’t have a boyfriend for a very long time. The problem is that I want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, I don't want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex. I have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. Luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. I feel dirty by doing this, but I feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal.

Most people are surprised when they find out that I am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think I am really good looking. I am tall, I play lots of sports, and I get excellent grades in school. I am in my first year of university right now, and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest. It bothers me. Most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already. I feel like I will be single forever sometimes.","I think that every person who has been single for any extended period of time has felt the same worries - myself included. Since relationships are so important to us we fear not having them and being single. It is similar to fearing that we won't ever get a good job when we have been out of work for awhile or fearing that we won't be healthy when we have been sick. We fear these things because they are so important - not because these fears are realistic or true! There is immense pressure put on young single people from peers and media to conform to ideas of what is normal and to meet expectations in terms of sexual experience, dating, etc. While some people may judge an adult who is a virgin - others will respect your choices and feel even more attracted to you because of your choices. Experimenting with sex, so long as you are being safe and respectful is also completely okay and normal. Since expectations vary and we can't be happy if we are always comparing ourselves to other people, we need to ultimately trust that being who we are and building a loving relationship with ourselves is the key to meeting someone who will cherish us for all the ways that we are special and unique, virgin or not. When we are able to really accept ourselves and trust in our loveableness (not a real word but you get what I mean!) then meeting someone special is simply a matter of time and effort - putting ourselves out in the world in situations where we are likely to meet other single people looking for relationships. When you are most afraid of being alone - remember that this fear is simply a reminder of how much you value relationships. Use that passion about wanting relationships to build the best relationship you can with yourself and then one day soon some lucky person will stumble into your life and benefit immensely from your passion and your ability to be authentically who you are rather than pretending to be ""normal"" or whatever that is anyway. Hope this helps! ","First of all, I want to acknowledge how brave it is for you to share these feelings. What you’re experiencing is deeply personal, and it’s clear that you’re grappling with a lot of emotions and societal pressures. Let’s break this down and address your concerns in a way that might help you feel more at peace with yourself and your journey.

### 1. **You Are Not Alone**
It’s easy to feel like everyone around you is in relationships or has more experience, but the truth is that everyone’s timeline is different. Many people your age are in similar situations, even if it doesn’t seem that way. Social media and societal expectations can distort reality, making it feel like you’re “behind.” But there’s no universal timeline for relationships, sex, or love. Your path is uniquely yours, and that’s okay.

### 2. **Your Worth Is Not Defined by Relationships or Virginity**
Your value as a person is not tied to whether you’ve had a boyfriend, been kissed, or had sex. You’re already accomplished in so many ways—excelling in sports, academics, and more. These qualities make you who you are, and they’re far more important than any relationship status. It’s okay to want love and connection, but don’t let the absence of those things define your self-worth.

### 3. **It’s Okay to Have Boundaries**
You mentioned wanting to lose your virginity to someone who cares about you. That’s a valid and healthy boundary to have. It’s important to honor your own feelings and desires rather than giving in to societal pressures. If hookups or casual encounters leave you feeling “dirty” or unsatisfied, it’s okay to step back and wait for something that aligns with your values.

### 4. **Relationships Take Time**
Finding the right person isn’t something that happens overnight. It’s okay if you haven’t met someone yet who wants to pursue a relationship with you. University is a time of growth and self-discovery, and many people don’t find meaningful relationships until later. Focus on building friendships, exploring your interests, and becoming the best version of yourself. The right person will come along when the time is right.

### 5. **Don’t Compare Yourself to Others**
It’s easy to look at your family or peers and feel like you’re falling behind, but everyone’s journey is different. Just because someone else has been in a relationship or had sex doesn’t mean they’re happier or more fulfilled. Comparison can rob you of joy and make you feel inadequate, but the truth is that your experiences are valid and valuable, even if they’re different from others’.

### 6. **Focus on What Makes You Happy**
Instead of worrying about what you’re missing, try to focus on the things that bring you joy. Whether it’s sports, academics, hobbies, or spending time with friends, these activities can help you feel more fulfilled and confident. When you’re happy and content with your life, you’re more likely to attract people who appreciate you for who you are.

### 7. **Be Kind to Yourself**
It’s easy to fall into self-loathing when you feel like you’re not meeting societal expectations, but try to treat yourself with the same kindness and compassion you’d offer a friend. You’re doing the best you can, and that’s enough. It’s okay to feel anxious or uncertain, but don’t let those feelings define you.

### 8. **Consider Talking to Someone You Trust**
If these feelings are overwhelming, it might help to talk to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor. Sometimes, sharing your thoughts with someone who can offer support and perspective can make a big difference. A counselor can also help you work through feelings of anxiety, self-loathing, or pressure in a healthy way.

### 9. **You Are Enough**
Remember, you are enough just as you are. You don’t need a boyfriend or sexual experience to be worthy of love and respect. The right person will come along when the time is right, and they’ll appreciate you for who you are—not just for your relationship history.

You’re navigating a challenging and emotional time, but you’re stronger than you realize. Take things one step at a time, and don’t be afraid to prioritize your own well-being and values. You’ve got this.",0.41074037551879883
2531,"The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headaches—mostly mouth breathing and snoring. It makes me angry, and I want to solve it myself.","Probably good to know in what type of situations you are, in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoring.If you're sleeping beside your partner who does these actions, would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchen.Basically, if the person who does these actions which bother you, start by telling them.Depending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds, or not, willing to change, or not, has a good deal to do with next steps.I don't really see any step you're able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the head.One path I don't recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered, or dismissing your own sensitivity someone.Your needs matter.","It sounds like you might be experiencing **misophonia**, a condition where certain sounds trigger strong emotional or physiological responses, such as anger, irritation, or headaches. Mouth breathing, snoring, and eating noises are common triggers for people with misophonia. Here are some strategies to help you manage this:

### 1. **Understand and Acknowledge Your Triggers**
   - Recognize the specific sounds that bother you and how they affect you. This can help you prepare and implement coping strategies.

### 2. **Use Noise-Canceling Headphones or Earplugs**
   - Invest in high-quality noise-canceling headphones or earplugs to block out triggering sounds when possible.
   - Alternatively, listen to white noise, calming music, or nature sounds to mask the noises.

### 3. **Create a Safe Space**
   - If you’re in an environment where these sounds are common (e.g., at home or work), designate a quiet area where you can retreat when needed.

### 4. **Practice Relaxation Techniques**
   - When you feel triggered, try deep breathing, mindfulness, or meditation to calm your body and mind.
   - Progressive muscle relaxation or visualization techniques can also help reduce anger and tension.

### 5. **Communicate with Others**
   - If the sounds are coming from people close to you (e.g., a partner snoring), gently explain how it affects you and work together to find solutions (e.g., using nasal strips for snoring or eating in separate spaces).

### 6. **Distract Yourself**
   - Engage in an activity that requires focus, such as reading, drawing, or solving puzzles, to divert your attention from the triggering sounds.

### 7. **Seek Professional Help**
   - Consider consulting a therapist, especially one who specializes in misophonia or sound sensitivity. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help you reframe your emotional response to these sounds.
   - If headaches persist, consult a doctor to rule out underlying medical issues like migraines or tension headaches.

### 8. **Lifestyle Adjustments**
   - Ensure you’re getting enough sleep, staying hydrated, and managing stress, as these factors can worsen sensitivity to sounds.

### 9. **Experiment with Sound Therapy**
   - Some people find relief through sound therapy, which involves gradual exposure to triggering sounds in a controlled way to reduce sensitivity over time.

### 10. **Join a Support Group**
   - Connecting with others who experience misophonia can provide understanding, validation, and additional coping strategies.

Remember, it’s okay to feel frustrated, and seeking help is a sign of strength. With time and practice, you can develop strategies to manage your reactions and improve your quality of life.",0.42872822284698486
756,I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.,"First I think we have to acknowledge that you are doing something amazing.  You are putting yourself out there and becoming a Water Safety Instructor.   We often times will focus on the negative and forget about the positive.  Next, you had an incident where someone pointed something out which may have caused embarrassment.  Whether or not it was malicious on his part I think the important thing to focus on is what is called ""Common Humanity"".  Common Humanity is one of the three elements of self-compassion.  Common humanity essentially recognizes that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the shared human experience.  While you may have had this embarrassing moment at this time, that boy may have had an embarrassing moment another day.  We all have embarrassing moments.  When we recognize that we do not suffer in isolation then we are able to move past that suffering.  Additionally another element to self-compassion is self-kindness.  My question is why must you forgive yourself?  Rather, be kind to yourself for learning an amazing new talent.","I'm really sorry that happened to you—it sounds like an incredibly uncomfortable and embarrassing situation. First, know that it’s not your fault, and you shouldn’t feel ashamed. It’s important to feel confident and comfortable in what you’re wearing, especially in a professional setting like a Water Safety Instructor class. 

Here are a few steps you can take to address the situation:

1. **Address the Comment**: If you feel comfortable, you can calmly let the boy know that his comment was inappropriate and made you feel uncomfortable. Setting boundaries is important, especially in a class setting.

2. **Find a Solution for Your Swimsuit**: If your current swimsuit isn’t working for you, consider reaching out to the instructor or program coordinator. They may have resources or suggestions, such as borrowing a suit or finding affordable options. Many organizations understand these challenges and want to support you.

3. **Look for Affordable Options**: If you’re on a tight budget, check out second-hand stores, online marketplaces, or sales at sporting goods stores. Some organizations or community centers also have programs to help with gear for training.

4. **Focus on Your Goals**: Don’t let this incident discourage you from becoming a Water Safety Instructor. You’re working toward an important and rewarding role, and this is just a small bump in the road.

You’re doing something amazing by training to help others stay safe in the water. Keep your head up, and don’t let this situation overshadow your progress and goals.",0.4638162851333618

How do I find someone to talk to?,"If there is no one in your life with whom you feel comfortable, I would recommend identifying someone on this site, psychology today or goodtherapy.org who is in your area, then give that therapist a call to see if you would be a good match.  ","I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling this way, but I'm glad you're reaching out for help. It’s important to talk to someone who can support you. Here are some steps you can take to find someone to talk to:

### 1. **Reach Out to Friends or Family**
   - Sometimes, sharing your feelings with someone you trust can make a big difference. Let them know you’re struggling and need someone to listen.

   - **Therapists/Counselors**: A licensed therapist or counselor can provide professional support. You can search for one in your area through directories like Psychology Today or your local health services.

### 8. **Emergency Help**

3496,"My mother is combative with me when I say I don't want to talk with her about my depression.  

She hasn't been supportive of me in the past and she isn't someone that I feel comfortable opening up to. She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I don't want to or can't answer. I tell her I don't want to talk and she starts arguments with me. 

How can I get her to understand?","Your situation sounds extremely frustrating.You're doing the right move to state you don't want to discuss your depression with her.I guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression.  If you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation, and you would like to tell her your true reason, then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time, not in the middle of an argument.Having an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept.  You may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this.","I'm sorry you're going through this—it sounds like a really challenging situation. It’s completely valid to want to protect your boundaries, especially when it comes to something as personal as your mental health. Here are some steps you can take to try to navigate this:

---

### 1. **Set Clear and Firm Boundaries**
   - Be direct but calm. For example:  
     *""I appreciate that you’re trying to help, but I’m not comfortable discussing this with you right now. I need you to respect that.""*  
   - If she pushes back, repeat your boundary without engaging in an argument. Consistency is key.

---

### 2. **Explain Why You’re Setting These Boundaries**
   - If you feel safe doing so, you can explain why you’re hesitant to open up. For example:  
     *""In the past, I’ve felt unsupported when I’ve tried to talk about this, so it’s hard for me to feel comfortable sharing now.""*  
   - This might help her understand your perspective, though it doesn’t guarantee she’ll react well.

---

### 3. **Redirect the Conversation**
   - If she brings up topics you don’t want to discuss, steer the conversation elsewhere. For example:  
     *""I’d rather talk about something else. How’s [neutral topic] going?""*  
   - This can help avoid conflict while maintaining your boundaries.

---

### 4. **Stay Calm and Avoid Engaging in Arguments**
   - If she becomes combative, try not to escalate. You can say:  
     *""I’m not going to argue about this. I’ve already told you how I feel.""*  
   - Then, disengage physically or emotionally if needed.

---

### 5. **Seek Support Elsewhere**
   - If your mother isn’t a safe person to talk to, lean on others who are supportive—friends, a therapist, or a support group.  
   - You might also say to her:  
     *""I’m working through this with people who are helping me. I’ll let you know if I need anything from you.""*  

---

### 6. **Consider Her Intentions (If Possible)**
   - Sometimes, parents act this way because they’re worried or feel helpless, even if their approach is harmful. Acknowledge her concern, but reinforce your boundaries:  
     *""I know you’re trying to help, but this isn’t the kind of support I need right now.""*  

---

### 7. **Limit Contact if Necessary**
   - If she continues to disregard your boundaries and it’s affecting your mental health, it’s okay to limit your interactions with her. You can say:  
     *""I need some space right now. I’ll reach out when I’m ready.""*  

---

### 8. **Practice Self-Compassion**
   - It’s not your responsibility to make her understand if she’s unwilling to listen. Focus on protecting your well-being and doing what’s best for you.

2851,"Over the years, I have slowly lost everything: my jobs, my cars, my freedom, and my money. I am a stay-at-home mom who doesn't make any money, doesn't have a car, never goes out, and cleans all day long everyday.","There are an infinite number of possibilities here. You included a lot of things that you don't have. Is there anyway that you can have some freedom for a few hours a week, at least? A lot of times stay at home moms have groups when they meet at different public places where their children can play together and they can talk together. I don't know how old your child or children is/are, but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the future.I wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you. I don't know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things. I wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted? If you can sort out some possible answers to that, maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happen.Also, again depending on the age of your children, some parents can do things while the children are sleeping, even if you are in the same room. For example, if your children are sleeping for about two hours, maybe 30 minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do.","I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way. It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy load, and it’s completely valid to feel overwhelmed, frustrated, or even lost. Being a stay-at-home mom is incredibly demanding, and it’s easy to feel like your identity, independence, and sense of purpose have been overshadowed by the daily grind. You’re not alone in feeling this way, and it’s important to acknowledge how much you’re doing—even if it doesn’t always feel like it’s appreciated or recognized.

Here are a few thoughts that might help:

### 1. **Acknowledge Your Worth**
   - What you’re doing—raising children, managing a household, and keeping everything running—is *huge*. It’s often invisible work, but it’s essential. You’re contributing in ways that can’t always be measured in money or recognition.
   - Remind yourself that your value isn’t tied to a job, a car, or material possessions. You’re more than what you have or don’t have.

### 2. **Find Small Ways to Reclaim Yourself**
   - Even in the midst of your responsibilities, try to carve out tiny moments for yourself. It could be as simple as reading a book, taking a walk, or doing something creative.
   - If you’re able, consider exploring hobbies or interests that bring you joy or a sense of accomplishment. It doesn’t have to be big—just something that feels like *you*.

### 3. **Seek Support**
   - It’s okay to ask for help. Whether it’s from a partner, family, friends, or even a support group, sharing your feelings can lighten the emotional load.
   - If you’re feeling isolated, connecting with other moms (even online) can help you feel less alone. Many people are going through similar struggles.

### 4. **Set Small Goals**
   - If you’re feeling stuck, start with small, achievable goals. Maybe it’s learning something new, saving a little money for something meaningful, or planning a small outing.
   - Taking small steps can help you feel more in control and give you a sense of progress.

### 5. **Talk to Someone**
   - If you’re feeling deeply overwhelmed or hopeless, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor. They can help you process your feelings and work toward solutions.
   - Sometimes, just having someone listen without judgment can make a world of difference.

### 6. **Remember It’s Temporary**
   - Life has seasons, and this one won’t last forever. As your children grow, you’ll likely have more opportunities to reclaim parts of your independence and identity.
   - In the meantime, try to focus on what you *can* control, even if it’s small.

You’re doing an incredible job, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. It’s okay to grieve what you’ve lost, but don’t forget to celebrate the strength and resilience it takes to keep going. You are worthy of care, support, and happiness. ❤️",0.45458072423934937
3400,"I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I can't afford to live alone.

My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules. She is trying to control my life. What should I do?","That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now.  The first thing to under is that you can’t change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior.  The thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions.  You may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan. The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior.  Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy.  Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack.  There are ways you can deal with controlling parents – and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you’ll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they’re trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you’re losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust. There aren’t any quick tips on how to deal with parents who want to control you; you need to find strategies that are geared to your specific family situation.

","Living with your parents in your early 20s is a common situation, especially given the financial challenges many young adults face. However, it can be tough when your mother’s rules feel overly controlling. Here are some steps you can take to navigate this situation:

---

### 1. **Understand Her Perspective**
   - Your mother may be trying to protect you or ensure harmony in the household. Try to see things from her point of view and acknowledge her concerns.
   - Recognize that her rules may come from a place of care, even if they feel restrictive.

---

### 2. **Communicate Openly**
   - Have a calm and respectful conversation with her. Express how you feel without being confrontational.
   - Use ""I"" statements, such as ""I feel like I’m not being given enough independence"" instead of ""You’re controlling me.""
   - Listen to her concerns and be willing to compromise.

---

### 3. **Set Boundaries**
   - Discuss specific areas where you’d like more freedom (e.g., curfew, social life, personal space).
   - Propose reasonable boundaries that respect both her rules and your need for independence.

---

### 4. **Take Responsibility**
   - Show that you’re mature and responsible by contributing to the household (e.g., helping with chores, paying a small amount of rent if possible).
   - This can help build trust and demonstrate that you’re ready for more independence.

---

### 5. **Focus on Your Goals**
   - Work toward becoming financially independent. Create a plan to save money, improve your skills, or find a better-paying job.
   - Having a clear goal of moving out can motivate you and give you something to work toward.

---

### 6. **Pick Your Battles**
   - Not every rule is worth fighting over. Focus on the ones that matter most to you and let go of smaller issues.
   - Compromising on minor things can help maintain peace in the household.

---

### 7. **Seek Outside Support**
   - If the situation feels overwhelming, consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor for advice and emotional support.
   - A neutral third party can sometimes help mediate discussions with your mother.

---

### 8. **Be Patient**
   - Change takes time. Your mother may need time to adjust to the idea of you having more independence.
   - Continue to demonstrate maturity and responsibility, and she may gradually ease her rules.

2411,"My ex-husband told my two adolescents that Santa doesn't exist on the day before Christmas. They are desperate to hold on to the magic of Christmas, but I don't know if it's right for me to lie to them and tell them that Santa is real. I don't want to let them down and make them lose out on those memories, but I also don't want to lose their trust.","Well Boise, the cat's out of the bag now, isn't it? I love that you want to help your kids keep the magic of Christmas. They must want that too if they still believe in Santa into their teen years, which is unusual, I believe. I wonder if they had already figured it out anyway?But they know now, and your ex had the right to tell them if he felt it was best. So it's time to explain to them what a loving and magical thing it is that parents do, and Christmas can still be magical in so many ways. Really, who says they have to stop believing in Santa? Santa is very real as a spirit of surprise, generosity and love. ","This is a delicate situation, and your concern for your children’s feelings and trust is admirable. Here are some suggestions to navigate this while preserving their joy and your relationship with them:

### 1. **Acknowledge Their Feelings**
   - Validate their emotions by saying something like, ""I can see how upsetting this is for you. It’s okay to feel sad or disappointed.""
   - Let them know it’s normal to feel conflicted when they hear something that challenges their beliefs.

### 2. **Focus on the Spirit of Santa**
   - Instead of confirming or denying Santa’s existence, emphasize the *magic* and *spirit* of Santa. You might say, ""Santa represents the joy, kindness, and giving that we celebrate during Christmas. That magic is real, no matter what.""
   - This approach keeps the wonder alive without directly lying to them.

### 3. **Let Them Decide**
   - If they’re old enough, you could gently guide them toward their own conclusion. For example, ""What do you think? Do you believe in the magic of Santa?"" This allows them to hold onto their belief if they choose to.

### 4. **Be Honest in an Age-Appropriate Way**
   - If they press for the truth, you can be honest while still preserving the magic. For example, ""Santa is a wonderful story that helps us remember to be kind and generous. The spirit of Santa is real, even if he’s not a person who delivers presents.""

### 5. **Reassure Them About Trust**
   - Let them know that you’ll always be honest with them and that you’re there to support them. Say something like, ""I want you to always feel like you can trust me, and I’ll always do my best to help you understand the world.""

### 6. **Create New Traditions**
   - If they’re feeling let down, involve them in creating new traditions that keep the magic alive. For example, they could become ""Santa’s helpers"" and help you choose gifts for others or participate in charitable acts.

### 7. **Address Your Ex-Husband’s Actions**
   - If you feel comfortable, have a calm conversation with your ex-husband about how this affected the kids. Encourage him to be mindful of their feelings in the future.

### 8. **Remember Their Resilience**

2114,"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","Yes, if crying is how you are expressing an emotion, then not only would it be normal, but hopefully encouraged, because it's an important part of therapy to have a safe space to express your emotions. We might encourage you to put words to the tears as well, to help you expand on your experience and begin to make more sense of it.As a therapist, our job is help you open up and feel comfortable enough doing so. I sincerely hope no therapist would ever shame you for whatever experience you are having in the room.","First of all, it’s completely normal to feel nervous before starting therapy—it’s a big step, and it’s okay to feel vulnerable. As for your fear of crying and feeling embarrassed, let me reassure you:

1. **Crying is normal in therapy.** Therapists are trained to handle emotions, and crying is a natural and healthy way to express feelings. It’s not something they judge or find awkward—they’re there to support you, not to shame you.

2. **Therapists are used to it.** They’ve seen people cry countless times, and they know how to create a safe, nonjudgmental space for you to process your emotions. It’s literally their job to help you feel comfortable, even when you’re upset.

3. **Crying can be therapeutic.** It’s a release of pent-up emotions, and it often helps people feel lighter afterward. Allowing yourself to cry can be an important part of the healing process.

4. **You don’t have to cry if you’re not ready.** Therapy moves at your pace, and you don’t have to dive into the deepest, most emotional parts of your life right away. You can start with what feels manageable and build trust over time.

5. **It’s okay to feel embarrassed, but you don’t need to.** If you do cry, remind yourself that you’re in a safe space, and your therapist is there to help, not judge. It’s okay to be human and have emotions—that’s why you’re there.

Lastly, it might help to share your fear with your therapist at the start of your session. They can reassure you and help you feel more comfortable. You’re taking a brave step by seeking help, and that’s something to be proud of. You’ve got this!",0.5478872656822205
1138,"I’m a man, and I’m soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but it’s been happening a lot. I don't know what to do.","I would start by examining the reasons for seeking out other relationships. Are you getting something from the other men that you do not currently receive from your current partner? Such as, is it more exciting with others and that excitement is lacking in your current relationship?","First, I want to acknowledge that you’re in a complex and emotionally challenging situation. It’s important to approach this with honesty, both with yourself and with others involved. Here are some steps to consider as you navigate this:

### 1. **Reflect on Your Feelings and Motivations**
   - Take time to understand why you’ve been engaging in these relationships. Are you exploring your sexuality? Feeling unfulfilled in your current relationship? Seeking validation or excitement? Understanding your motivations can help you make clearer decisions.
   - Consider whether you’re truly ready for marriage or if there are unresolved aspects of your identity or desires that need attention.

### 2. **Be Honest with Yourself**
   - Acknowledge the impact of your actions on your fiancée and your relationship. Infidelity (emotional or physical) can cause significant harm, and it’s important to take responsibility for your choices.
   - Ask yourself if you’re committed to your fiancée and the life you’re building together. If not, it’s better to address this now rather than after marriage.

### 3. **Communicate Openly**
   - If you decide to move forward with the marriage, honesty with your fiancée is crucial. While this conversation will be difficult, it’s a necessary step toward rebuilding trust and ensuring both of you are on the same page.
   - Consider seeking the help of a therapist or counselor to facilitate this conversation and provide a safe space for both of you to express your feelings.

### 4. **Seek Professional Support**
   - A therapist can help you explore your feelings, understand your actions, and make decisions that align with your values and goals. If you’re questioning your sexuality, a therapist who specializes in LGBTQ+ issues can provide valuable guidance.
   - Couples therapy can also be beneficial if you and your fiancée decide to work through this together.

### 5. **Make a Decision**
   - If you’re committed to your fiancée and want to move forward, you’ll need to end any extramarital relationships and focus on rebuilding trust and intimacy in your relationship.
   - If you’re unsure about your commitment or feel that you need to explore your sexuality further, it may be kinder to delay or reconsider the marriage rather than enter into it under false pretenses.

### 6. **Prioritize Kindness and Integrity**
   - Whatever you decide, approach the situation with compassion for yourself and others. Avoid making impulsive decisions or hiding the truth, as this can lead to more pain in the long run.

This is a challenging situation, but it’s also an opportunity for growth and self-discovery. Take the time to reflect, seek support, and make choices that align with your values and long-term happiness.",0.48538798093795776
1174,"I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out.    How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it. I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy. What should I do?","Keep doing the crossdressing since you like it.Your problem sounds more a matter of timing and reason to tell the girl about it.Not keeping a secret is a good attitude regarding meaningful parts of your life.  Usually our relationship partner is someone whom we trust as a safe person to know all about us.Once you feel at ease with your potential partner then bring up your crossdressing.  Based on their handling of this intimate part of your life, you will know more as to whether or not you feel more or less drawn to them.Secrets held within a relationship usually get worse with time.   The person who feels unsafe in truly being and stating themselves eventually will end up feeling ashamed of parts of them which prior to the relationship, felt good or at least not worrisome.","First and foremost, it’s important to embrace who you are and what makes you happy. Crossdressing and expressing your feminine side is a valid and beautiful part of your identity, and you deserve to live authentically. The challenge of finding someone who accepts and appreciates you for who you are is real, but it’s not insurmountable. Here are some thoughts and suggestions to help you navigate this:

### 1. **Be True to Yourself**
   - If crossdressing and expressing your femininity make you happy, continue doing it. Suppressing this part of yourself to please others can lead to long-term dissatisfaction and resentment. Authenticity is key to building meaningful relationships.

### 2. **Be Upfront, but Tactful**
   - Honesty is important in any relationship, but how and when you share this part of yourself can make a difference. You don’t need to disclose everything on the first date, but once you feel a connection and trust is building, it’s worth bringing it up. Frame it as an important part of who you are and something that brings you joy.

### 3. **Communicate Openly**
   - When you’re ready to share, approach the conversation with confidence and openness. For example, you could say something like, “I want to share something important with you because I value honesty and trust. I enjoy expressing my feminine side through crossdressing, and it’s a meaningful part of who I am. I’d love to talk about it if you have any questions or thoughts.”

### 4. **Be Prepared for Different Reactions**
   - Not everyone will understand or accept this part of you, and that’s okay. It’s not a reflection of your worth but rather their own biases or limitations. The right person will appreciate you for who you are and celebrate your authenticity.

### 5. **Seek Like-Minded People**
   - Consider connecting with communities or groups where gender expression and fluidity are more accepted. This can include LGBTQ+ spaces, online forums, or social events where people are more open-minded. This increases your chances of meeting someone who shares your values or appreciates your uniqueness.

### 6. **Don’t Give Up**
   - Rejection can be discouraging, but it’s important to remember that the right person is out there. It might take time to find someone who truly accepts and loves you for who you are, but it’s worth the effort.

### 7. **Focus on Self-Love**
   - While it’s natural to want a partner who accepts you, it’s equally important to cultivate self-acceptance and self-love. Surround yourself with supportive friends, engage in activities that make you happy, and remind yourself that your worth isn’t defined by anyone else’s opinion.

### Final Thoughts:
You don’t need to stop crossdressing or hide this part of yourself to find love. The right person will appreciate your authenticity and see it as a strength, not a flaw. By being honest and open, you’ll attract people who align with your values and respect you for who you are. Keep being true to yourself—your happiness and authenticity are worth it.",0.4920186400413513
1820,I need help knowing how to deal with stress. What can I do?,"Our body reacts to stress typically by breathing more shallowly, increasing our heart rate and tensing our muscles - so one thing that I find really effective is to try to do the opposite of that, which sends the signal to our mind that we are relaxed.

1846,They're calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as I do. I'm tired of being called names. What should I do?,"It sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner, correct? Communication is key to any relationship. I would recommend speaking with your friends face-to-face to address why they feel your behavior is concerning. In-person contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts, emails or any written response can be misconstrued. Be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded. If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling, maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly. Especially if this friendship is valuable to you. However, make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them. On the other hand, if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded, it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship. Not all friendships are healthy ones. And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it.I hope you are able to get this matter sorted. Best of luck!","I'm sorry you're going through this—being called names can be really hurtful, especially when it feels unfair or hypocritical. Here are some steps you can take to address the situation:

1. **Stay Calm and Reflect**  
   Take a moment to breathe and assess the situation. Are they projecting their own insecurities onto you? Are they misinterpreting your actions? Understanding their motives can help you respond thoughtfully rather than react emotionally.

2. **Communicate Assertively**  
   If you feel safe doing so, calmly address the name-calling. Use ""I"" statements to express how it makes you feel. For example:  
   *""I feel hurt when you call me names like 'hypocrite' or 'baby.' I’d appreciate it if we could talk about this respectfully.""*  
   This shifts the focus to your feelings rather than escalating the conflict.

3. **Set Boundaries**  
   Let them know that name-calling is not acceptable to you. You might say:  
   *""I’m not okay with being called names. If this continues, I’ll need to step away from this conversation.""*  
   Boundaries help protect your emotional well-being.

4. **Avoid Engaging in the Same Behavior**  
   It’s tempting to retaliate, but responding with name-calling or anger may escalate the situation. Staying composed shows maturity and can help de-escalate the conflict.

5. **Seek Support**  
   If the name-calling persists, consider talking to someone you trust—a friend, family member, or counselor. They can provide perspective and support.

6. **Evaluate the Relationship**  
   If this is a recurring issue, ask yourself if this relationship is healthy for you. Sometimes, distancing yourself from toxic individuals is the best way to protect your peace.

7. **Focus on Self-Care**  
   Being called names can take a toll on your self-esteem. Engage in activities that make you feel good about yourself and remind yourself of your worth.

3039,"I empathize so much, even with characters on tv or in video games, that I actually feel physical pain. This has made life difficult to say the least.

I believe I have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder. But since it's such a new disorder I can't find any information about it. Could this be what is going on with me?","The world needs more people lately who have such a high degree of empathy which you describe in yourself!If it feels a little burdensome, then look to balance what is too much with its opposite.  Since you're giving a lot of empathy, maybe you'd like receiving a lot of empathy.In the situation you describe, when you start empathizing with others, real or cartoon, ask yourself whether you've felt empathy coming in your direction lately.Often people give to others what they feel within themselves is missing.The emotional brain reasons that if I give you my support, say, then at least I will feel half of what being supported is like.Obviously the wish to receive more empathy cannot be fulfilled by you directly.  Empathy is delivered by someone who is willing to offer it.Reflect on whether you are allowing those who are in your world, to know when you would like to receive their empathy.Is it possible you keep your feelings to yourself and present as though you are able to handle a great deal more than you'd like to handle without anyone's kindness to support you?Being open to others about your own inner thoughts and feelings is much more difficult than it sounds.It sounds easy to just tell someone how you feel.Sometimes the first step is the most difficult, of accessing how you feel.Start with knowing the amount of empathy you'd like from others and what stops you from asking.Also, about your diagnosis and the lack of  studies and lists and formulas.  Each person is unique, the instructions and guidelines don't necessarily mean very much.  Often having a diagnosis makes a person feel weak, stigmatized, incompetent. Forget the diagnosis and concentrate on what you need to do differently in order to feel better.The answers are inside you, not inside a book or website.","It sounds like you're experiencing a high level of empathy, which can be both a gift and a challenge. Hyper empathy, while not officially recognized as a standalone disorder in diagnostic manuals like the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) or ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases), is a term sometimes used to describe an extreme or heightened capacity for empathy. This can manifest as deeply feeling the emotions, and sometimes even physical sensations, of others—whether they're real people, fictional characters, or even animals.

Here are some possibilities to consider:

### 1. **Highly Sensitive Person (HSP)**
   - You might identify with traits of being a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP). HSPs are thought to have a more sensitive nervous system, making them more attuned to subtleties in their environment and more deeply affected by the emotions and experiences of others. While this isn't a disorder, it can explain why you feel things so intensely.

### 2. **Empathy-Related Conditions**
   - Some conditions, like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or certain personality traits (e.g., borderline personality disorder), can involve heightened empathy or emotional sensitivity. However, these conditions are complex and involve other symptoms as well.

### 3. **Mirror-Touch Synesthesia**
   - Mirror-touch synesthesia is a rare neurological condition where individuals physically feel sensations when they see others being touched or experiencing pain. If your empathy includes physical sensations, this could be worth exploring.

### 4. **Trauma or Emotional Overload**
   - If you've experienced trauma or emotional overload, your brain might be hyper-attuned to the emotions of others as a coping mechanism. This can sometimes lead to an overwhelming sense of empathy.

### 5. **Empathy as a Strength**
   - While it can feel overwhelming, your heightened empathy might also be a unique strength. It’s important to find ways to manage it so it doesn’t interfere with your well-being.

### What Can You Do?
- **Self-Care Strategies:** Practice grounding techniques, mindfulness, or meditation to help manage overwhelming emotions. Setting boundaries with media (e.g., limiting exposure to emotionally intense TV shows or games) can also help.
- **Therapy:** A therapist, especially one trained in emotional regulation or trauma, can help you explore and manage your experiences. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) might be particularly helpful.
- **Community Support:** Connecting with others who share similar experiences can provide validation and coping strategies. Online forums or support groups might be a good place to start.
- **Neurological Evaluation:** If you suspect a neurological component (like mirror-touch synesthesia), consulting a neurologist could provide clarity.

### Final Thoughts
While ""hyper empathy disorder"" isn't a formally recognized diagnosis, your experience is valid and worth exploring. Working with a mental health professional can help you better understand your unique traits and develop strategies to thrive with your heightened empathy. You’re not alone, and there are ways to channel this sensitivity into a strength while also protecting your own well-being.",0.4569329023361206

Most people use therapy as a way to process their life's struggles and often times this results in them crying during session. Crying is a way to release those negative emotions and to cope with what is happening in life. We have come to believe that crying is something bad at times and so have conditioned ourselves to avoid crying out in public places. In therapy though, where there are no such expectations and where you can be open and honest about how you are feeling it is normal to cry.","Yes, it is completely normal for people to cry during therapy. In fact, it’s a common and healthy response. Therapy often involves exploring deeply personal, emotional, or painful experiences, and crying can be a natural way for your body to release pent-up emotions. It’s a sign that you’re engaging with the process and allowing yourself to be vulnerable, which is an important part of healing.

Therapists are trained to create a safe and supportive environment for clients to express themselves, including crying. They understand that tears can be a form of emotional release and a step toward processing difficult feelings. You’re definitely not alone in this—many people cry during therapy, and it’s nothing to feel embarrassed or worried about.

Crying is a natural way for us to cope with the sadness that we experience in life. When confronting some of these things in a counseling session, tears just seem to come naturally. Every Counselor should be well equipped to handle that level of emotion, and you would be far from the first to cry when talking with a Counselor.","First of all, it’s completely normal to feel nervous before starting counseling or therapy—it’s a big step, and it’s okay to feel vulnerable. Crying during therapy is a very common and natural response, and it’s absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. **Crying is Healthy**: It’s a way for your body and mind to release emotions that you’ve been holding onto. It’s not a sign of weakness—it’s a sign that you’re processing and engaging with your feelings.

2. **Therapists Expect It**: Your therapist has likely worked with many people who have cried during sessions. They’re there to support you, not to judge you.

3. **It’s Okay to Be Vulnerable**: Therapy is one of the few places where you’re encouraged to be completely honest and open. It’s okay to let your guard down—that’s often when the most meaningful work happens.

4. **You Can Take Your Time**: If you’re worried about crying, you can let your therapist know how you’re feeling at the start of the session. They can help you feel more comfortable and go at your own pace.

5. **It’s Part of the Process**: Therapy is about exploring your emotions and experiences. Sometimes that means tears, and that’s perfectly okay. It’s all part of healing and growth.

There are many possible reasons for these feelings, and it’s okay to take time to explore them. Here are some potential factors that might be contributing to how you’re feeling:

### 1. **Overwhelm or Stress**  
   Having a lot on your mind can make socializing feel exhausting or overwhelming. Your brain might be signaling that you need a break to process everything. Isolation can feel like a way to protect yourself from additional stress or demands.

### 2. **Emotional Exhaustion**  
   If you’ve been dealing with difficult emotions, relationships, or situations, you might feel drained. Isolation can feel like a safe space to recharge, even if it also brings feelings of loneliness.

### 3. **Loneliness vs. Being Alone**  
   It’s possible to feel lonely even when you’re surrounded by people, especially if you don’t feel understood or connected. On the other hand, being alone can sometimes amplify feelings of loneliness if you’re craving deeper connections.

### 4. **Mental Health Concerns**  
   Feelings of isolation and loneliness can be linked to mental health challenges like depression, anxiety, or burnout. If these feelings persist or feel overwhelming, it might be helpful to seek support from a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional.

### 5. **Fear of Judgment or Rejection**  
   Sometimes, the fear of being judged or rejected can make socializing feel daunting. This might lead to withdrawing as a way to avoid potential hurt.

### 6. **Need for Self-Reflection**  
   Your desire to stay in your room might be a sign that you need time to reflect on your thoughts, feelings, and priorities. This can be a healthy part of personal growth, even if it feels uncomfortable at times.

### 7. **Lack of Meaningful Connections**  
   If your social interactions feel shallow or unfulfilling, you might feel lonely even after spending time with others. This can lead to a desire to retreat and avoid socializing altogether.

### What Can You Do?  
Here are some gentle steps to help you navigate these feelings:  
1. **Be Kind to Yourself**  
   Acknowledge that it’s okay to feel this way. You’re not alone in experiencing these emotions, and it’s a sign that you’re human.

2. **Reach Out to Someone You Trust**  
   Even if it feels hard, sharing your feelings with someone who cares about you can help you feel less alone. You don’t have to face everything on your own.

3. **Set Small Goals**  
   If socializing feels overwhelming, start small. Send a text to a friend, or spend a few minutes in a low-pressure social setting.

4. **Practice Self-Care**  
   Take care of your physical and emotional needs. Sleep, eat nourishing foods, and engage in activities that bring you comfort or joy.

5. **Explore Your Feelings**  
   Journaling or talking to a therapist can help you better understand why you’re feeling this way and develop strategies to cope.

   - Be direct and consistent: Calmly but firmly tell her, “I appreciate your concern, but I’m not comfortable discussing this with you. I need you to respect that.”
   - Use “I” statements: For example, “I feel overwhelmed when we talk about this, so I need to keep it private for now.”
   - Repeat as necessary: If she persists, calmly restate your boundary without engaging in the argument.

### 2. **Redirect the Conversation**
   - Shift the focus: When she brings up your depression, gently steer the conversation elsewhere. For example, “I’d rather talk about something else. How’s [insert topic] going?”
   - Offer an alternative: If she’s genuinely concerned, suggest a way she can help that feels safe for you, like, “I’d really appreciate it if we could just spend time together without talking about this.”

### 3. **Explain Why You’re Setting Boundaries**
   - Be honest but kind: Let her know why you’re hesitant to open up. For example, “I’ve struggled with feeling unsupported in the past, so it’s hard for me to talk about this with you right now.”
   - Emphasize your needs: “I’m working on my mental health in my own way, and I need space to do that.”

### 4. **Stay Calm and Avoid Escalation**
   - Don’t engage in arguments: If she becomes combative, avoid reacting emotionally. Simply restate your boundary and disengage if necessary.
   - Take a break: If the conversation becomes too intense, excuse yourself and say, “I need some time to myself right now. Let’s talk later.”

### 5. **Seek Support Elsewhere**
   - Lean on others: If your mother isn’t a safe person to talk to, confide in someone you trust, like a friend, therapist, or support group.
   - Consider professional help: A therapist can help you process your feelings and develop strategies for dealing with difficult family dynamics.

### 6. **Accept That She May Not Understand**
   - Sometimes, despite your best efforts, people may not respect or understand your boundaries. In those cases, it’s okay to prioritize your well-being and limit your interactions with her.

### 7. **Take Care of Yourself**
   - Practice self-care: Engage in activities that help you feel grounded and supported.
   - Remind yourself that it’s okay to protect your mental health, even if it means setting boundaries with someone you love.

It’s not easy to navigate these situations, but you deserve to feel safe and respected. If your mother continues to disregard your boundaries, it’s okay to create distance or limit contact for your own well-being.",0.49154365062713623
969,I am a survivor of multiple sexual abuse/rape experiences. Triggers are having an effect on my daily life and my sexual relationship with my partner. I'm trying to learn to cope with them.,"I'm glad you're willing to keep optimistic about life improving and offering better relationships than some of the ones in which you greatly suffered.One suggestion is to develop patience with yourself and the process of regaining your willingness to trust other people.Sexual intimacy engages all of who we truly are.   Being cautious as to who and how much you allow someone into your life, is natural for anyone recovering from trauma.Allow yourself to withdraw when situations feel dangerous.   Your sense of danger is most likely on higher alert than had you not been victimized.Be attentive and cooperate with your own sense of readiness to engage in conversation, discussions and sex with your partner.Explain all this to your partner so the person can develop their own patience with your recuperation process.","I’m so sorry for what you’ve endured. Surviving multiple experiences of sexual abuse and rape is incredibly traumatic, and it’s understandable that triggers are affecting your daily life and relationships. It’s brave of you to seek ways to cope and heal. Here are some steps and strategies that may help you navigate this challenging journey:

---

### **1. Acknowledge Your Feelings**
- **Validate your emotions:** It’s okay to feel anger, sadness, fear, or confusion. These are natural responses to trauma.
- **Be patient with yourself:** Healing is not linear, and it’s okay to have difficult days.

---

### **2. Identify Triggers**
- **Track your triggers:** Write down situations, sounds, smells, or words that bring up distressing memories. This can help you better understand and prepare for them.
- **Communicate with your partner:** Let them know what might trigger you so they can support you.

---

### **3. Develop Coping Strategies**
- **Grounding techniques:** Use grounding exercises to stay present during a trigger. Examples include focusing on your breath, naming objects in the room, or holding something comforting.
- **Self-soothing:** Engage in activities that bring you comfort, like listening to calming music, taking a warm bath, or cuddling with a pet.
- **Mindfulness and meditation:** Practices like mindfulness can help you stay centered and reduce anxiety.

---

### **4. Seek Professional Support**
- **Therapy:** A trauma-informed therapist, especially one trained in EMDR, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), or somatic therapy, can help you process your experiences and develop coping tools.
- **Support groups:** Connecting with other survivors can provide a sense of community and understanding.

---

### **5. Rebuild Trust in Your Relationship**
- **Communicate openly:** Share your feelings and needs with your partner in a safe and supportive way.
- **Set boundaries:** Let your partner know what feels comfortable and what doesn’t in your sexual relationship.
- **Take it slow:** Rebuilding intimacy takes time. Focus on non-sexual touch and connection first.

---

### **6. Practice Self-Care**
- **Physical health:** Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep can help regulate your emotions.
- **Creative outlets:** Art, writing, or music can be therapeutic ways to express your feelings.
- **Journaling:** Writing about your experiences and emotions can help you process them.

---

### **7. Educate Yourself**
- **Learn about trauma:** Understanding how trauma affects the brain and body can help you feel less alone and more in control.
- **Read survivor stories:** Hearing how others have healed can be inspiring and validating.

---

### **8. Be Kind to Yourself**
- **Celebrate small wins:** Healing is a process, and every step forward is worth acknowledging.
- **Avoid self-blame:** The abuse was not your fault, and you deserve compassion and care.

---

### **9. Create a Safety Plan**
- **Identify safe spaces:** Know where you can go or who you can call if you feel overwhelmed.
- **Use calming tools:** Keep a list of grounding techniques, comforting items, or supportive contacts nearby.

---

### **10. Know You’re Not Alone**
- **Reach out for support:** Whether it’s friends, family, or a therapist, you don’t have to face this alone.
- **Remember your strength:** Surviving what you’ve been through shows incredible resilience. You are not defined by your trauma.

---

### **Resources for Support**
- **National Sexual Assault Hotline (RAINN):** 1-800-656-HOPE (4673) or online chat at rainn.org.
- **Therapy directories:** Psychology Today or BetterHelp can help you find a therapist.

2025,How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"To be able to identify a clear ending to a counseling relationship, we must have a clear understanding of the goals and limitations of treatment.  Usually, during the initial evaluation, I identify my client’s short term and long term therapy goals.  As therapy progress, we verify goals on a monthly to a quarterly basis, depending on the frequency of the appointments.  Once the therapy goals have been met, there is a closing session, the counseling relationship is ended, and the client can stop attending sessions.  In some cases, the client can also establish new goals and determine if I am a good fit for their therapy needs or if they need a new provider, in which case I provide multiple referrals.The counseling relationship could also end due to other factors like noncompliance= when a client is not committed to the agreed treatment process, or when the client’s or a counselor violates the counseling relationship.  Either the counselor or the client is able to end counseling.  Although, as mental health providers we need to provide a reason for terminating our therapeutic relationship and referral options, as a client no explanation is needed, a closing session is highly recommended.  ¿Cómo termina la terapia?¿Cómo un consejero decide cuando terminar las sesiones de consejería o terminar de trabajar con un paciente?Para poder determinar el final de la relación del consejero, debemos comprender las metas y parámetros de la terapia.  Usualmente durante la evaluación inicial se identifican metas a corto y largo plazo con el cliente, y se discute con el cliente como esas metas serán alcanzadas.  Durante el proceso de terapia el consejero revisa las metas mensual o trimestralmente dependiendo de la frecuencia de las citas.  Ya que las metas de terapia son alcanzadas, hay una sesión de cierre y el cliente puede terminar la terapia.   En algunos casos el cliente puede identificar nuevas metas para la terapia y determinar si el mismo consejero u otro consejero le pueden asistir. 
La relación de consejería también puede terminar por no conformar o violentar los parámetros  establecidos para la terapia.   Tanto el consejero como el cliente pueden terminar la relación de terapia.  Como proveedores de salud mental los consejeros estamos obligados a proveer un razón para la conclusión del tratamiento y proveer referidos según aplique, los clientes no necesitan proveer una explicación, aunque es recomendable discutirlo en una sesión de cierre.","Deciding when to end counseling sessions or terminate the therapeutic relationship is a critical and thoughtful process that requires careful consideration by the counselor. Here are some key factors and steps that guide this decision:

### 1. **Achievement of Treatment Goals**
   - The primary indicator for ending counseling is the client’s achievement of their agreed-upon treatment goals. If the client has made significant progress and feels capable of managing their challenges independently, it may be time to conclude the sessions.

### 2. **Client’s Readiness**
   - The counselor assesses the client’s readiness to end therapy. This includes evaluating whether the client feels confident, has developed coping skills, and can apply what they’ve learned in their daily life.

### 3. **Mutual Agreement**
   - Termination should ideally be a collaborative decision between the counselor and the client. Open discussions about the client’s progress, ongoing needs, and feelings about ending therapy are essential.

### 4. **Stabilization of Symptoms**
   - If the client’s symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression) have stabilized and they are functioning well, the counselor may consider termination while ensuring the client has a plan for maintaining their progress.

### 5. **Client’s Request**
   - If the client expresses a desire to end therapy, the counselor should explore the reasons behind this request. If the decision is appropriate, the counselor can work with the client to plan a structured termination.

### 6. **Lack of Progress**
   - If the client is not making progress despite consistent efforts, the counselor may consider termination or referral to another professional who might better meet the client’s needs.

### 7. **Ethical and Professional Considerations**
   - Counselors must adhere to ethical guidelines, such as avoiding abandonment and ensuring the client’s well-being. If termination is necessary (e.g., due to relocation or other professional reasons), the counselor should provide appropriate referrals and support.

### 8. **External Factors**
   - Practical considerations, such as financial constraints, insurance limitations, or logistical issues (e.g., relocation), may also influence the decision to end counseling.

### 9. **Termination Process**
   - When termination is decided, the counselor should:
     - Discuss the decision openly with the client.
     - Review progress and accomplishments.
     - Address any unresolved issues or concerns.
     - Develop a plan for maintaining progress and managing future challenges.
     - Provide referrals or resources if needed.
     - Allow time for closure and processing of the therapeutic relationship.

### 10. **Follow-Up**
   - In some cases, the counselor may schedule follow-up sessions or check-ins to ensure the client continues to thrive after termination.

### When Termination May Not Be Appropriate
   - If the client is in crisis or at risk, termination should be postponed until they are stable.
   - If the client feels unprepared or anxious about ending therapy, the counselor should address these concerns and adjust the timeline as needed.

Ultimately, the decision to end counseling should prioritize the client’s best interests, ensuring they feel supported and empowered to continue their journey independently.",0.3012692928314209
2867,I was born a girl. I look like a boy. I sometimes feel like a different variation of gender. I don't know what to say if someone asks my gender. I just get really confused and usually say my birth gender.,"I agree with Sherry, it is OK to give the answer that you feel most familiar with.  The most important part is not who people think you are, but that you know who you are.  Read about gender identity and fluidity.  Discovering the answer is a process, don't rush it to comply with others either way.  If you feel that this is a constant issue that keeps you awake and keeps you from enjoying your life, consider going to a therapist to discuss your feelings and concerns. ¿Qué significa que yo me sienta como diferentes géneros?Nací como niña. Me veo como niño.  A veces siento como una variación diferente de género.  No sé qué decirle a otros cuando pregunta que soy.  Me siento confuso y solo digo mi genero de nacimiento. Estoy de acuerdo con Sherry, está bien dar la respuesta que se sienta más cómoda.  La parte más importante no es quien las otras personas piensen que eres, sino quien tú piensas que eres.  Lee sobre el tema de identidad de género y fluidez de género.  Descubrir tu género puede ser un proceso, no lo apresures para complacer a otras personas.  Si sientes que este tema te esta quitando el sueno y te impide disfrutar tu vida, habla con tu consejero sobre tus sentimientos y preocupaciones.","It’s completely okay to feel confused or uncertain about your gender identity, and it’s also okay to take your time to explore and understand what feels right for you. Gender is a deeply personal experience, and it doesn’t have to fit into binary categories like ""boy"" or ""girl."" Many people identify as non-binary, genderqueer, genderfluid, or other variations that reflect the complexity of their feelings.

Here are a few things to consider:

1. **It’s okay to not have all the answers right now.** Gender identity is a journey, and it’s fine to explore and evolve over time. You don’t need to rush to define yourself.

2. **You can use different labels (or none at all).** If someone asks about your gender, you can say something like, “I’m still figuring it out,” or “I don’t feel like I fit into a specific box.” You can also use terms like “genderqueer,” “non-binary,” or “genderfluid” if they resonate with you.

3. **It’s okay to change your mind.** Your understanding of your gender might shift over time, and that’s perfectly normal. What feels right today might feel different tomorrow, and that’s okay.

4. **You don’t owe anyone an explanation.** If someone asks about your gender and you’re not comfortable sharing, it’s okay to say, “I’d rather not talk about it,” or “That’s personal.”

5. **Seek support if you need it.** Talking to a trusted friend, counselor, or LGBTQ+ support group can help you process your feelings and feel less alone.

Remember, your gender identity is valid no matter how you choose to express it. You are not alone in this experience, and there are many people who feel the same way you do. Take your time, be kind to yourself, and know that it’s okay to be exactly who you are.",0.19738949835300446
1964,"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","Therapy is by nature a safe place to discuss difficult, or painful memories or experiences and thereby it is normal that feelings of all kinds, including sadness, loss, frustration, disappointment, etc may arise.  This is part of processing and bringing closure to things that may have been pushed aside for a lifetime and can now be faced and dealt with.  Change too is often not easy, and can lead to crying, whether from frustration and set back...or also from joy and accomplishment!","Yes, it is completely normal for people to cry during therapy. In fact, it’s a very common and natural response. Therapy often involves exploring deep emotions, past traumas, or current struggles, which can bring up feelings of sadness, vulnerability, or relief. Crying is a healthy way to release emotions and can be an important part of the healing process.

You’re definitely not alone in this—many people cry in therapy, and therapists are trained to create a safe and supportive space for you to express your emotions, including tears. It’s a sign that you’re engaging with the process and allowing yourself to be open and honest, which is a positive step toward growth and healing. If you feel comfortable, you can also discuss your feelings about crying with your therapist—it can be a helpful conversation to understand your emotions better.",0.5583198666572571

If you don't know where she can go, there is probably a list of shelters for the county that you live in.","It sounds like she’s navigating a busy and transformative stage of life. Being in her early 20s with a toddler likely means she’s balancing the demands of parenting with her own personal growth, education, career, or other responsibilities. Here are a few thoughts or suggestions that might resonate with her situation:

1. **Support System**: Having a strong support system—whether it’s family, friends, or community resources—can make a big difference. She might consider reaching out to parenting groups or local organizations for support.

2. **Self-Care**: It’s easy to prioritize the child’s needs, but taking time for herself is crucial. Even small moments of self-care can help her recharge.

3. **Time Management**: Juggling parenting with other responsibilities can be overwhelming. Creating a routine or schedule might help her manage her time more effectively.

4. **Personal Goals**: It’s important for her to continue pursuing her own goals, whether they’re related to education, career, or personal interests. This can help her feel fulfilled and empowered.

5. **Patience and Grace**: Parenting is a learning process, and it’s okay to make mistakes. She should remind herself that she’s doing her best.

3076,I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.,"Sometimes we make ourselves feel worse with our own thoughts about things we can't change. We know that it is possible to overcome embarrassment and self-blame, but why does it seem so difficult to overcome it sometimes? If you tune into your own thoughts, or your ""internal dialogue"", you'll notice that your thoughts are connected to your feelings. So people who are holding onto embarrassment and self-blame often have thoughts like, ""How could I do that?"", ""I looked so stupid!"" ""Now people saw things I did not want them to see!"" If we tune in more, we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible, horrible, and that we cannot deal with it. These are self-sabotaging thoughts that lead to shame, self-blame and embarrassment. If you look at the evidence, you can find more rational thoughts such as, "" We all make mistakes"", ""People can look all different ways at different time - this incident does not define me!"" and ""If someone has a bad image or thought about me, it is really OK! People have all kinds of thoughts about other people, and it does not have to be a major problem."" When you practice your rational thoughts often and replace the negative ones, you will start to feel better, more confident and your embarrassment will decrease quickly.","I'm really sorry to hear that you experienced such an uncomfortable situation. It’s completely understandable to feel embarrassed, but please know that this is not your fault. Here are a few steps you can take to address the situation and feel more confident moving forward:

1. **Speak to the Instructor or Supervisor**: Let your instructor or a supervisor know what happened. They are there to ensure a safe and respectful environment for everyone. They may be able to provide guidance or resources to help you feel more comfortable.

2. **Find a Suitable Swimsuit**: If budget is a concern, consider looking for affordable options at discount stores, second-hand shops, or online marketplaces. Some organizations or community centers may also have resources or programs to help with such needs.

3. **Address the Comment**: If you feel comfortable, you can calmly let the boy know that his comment was inappropriate and made you feel uncomfortable. If you’re not comfortable doing this yourself, your instructor can help address it.

4. **Focus on Your Goals**: Remember why you’re becoming a Water Safety Instructor—to help others and make a positive impact. Don’t let this incident discourage you from pursuing your goals.

5. **Practice Self-Compassion**: It’s okay to feel embarrassed, but try not to be too hard on yourself. Everyone has moments where they feel exposed or vulnerable. What matters most is how you move forward.

Now anything I say to him he won't believe, even if I'm being honest. I don't know what else to do at this point. He constantly criticizes me.","Start a conversation with him about your sincere interest to earn back his trust.Ask him what he expects from you so that he will trust you again.If you are consciously willing and do try to earn back his trust, and have periodic conversations with him on whether he feels more at ease with trusting you, then after a few months of this, both of you should feel more secure in the relationship.","I'm sorry you're going through such a difficult situation. Trust is a cornerstone of any healthy relationship, and once it's broken, it can take a lot of time and effort to rebuild—if it’s even possible. Here are some steps you can consider:

### 1. **Acknowledge Your Actions**
   - Take full responsibility for the lies and actions that hurt your boyfriend. Avoid making excuses or shifting blame. A sincere acknowledgment of your mistakes is the first step toward healing.

### 2. **Apologize Sincerely**
   - Offer a genuine apology that focuses on how your actions affected him, not just on how you feel about the situation. For example, ""I’m truly sorry for lying and betraying your trust. I understand how much I’ve hurt you, and I regret my actions deeply.""

### 3. **Give Him Space**
   - If he’s feeling hurt or betrayed, he may need time to process his emotions. Pushing him to forgive you or move on too quickly can make things worse. Respect his need for space.

### 4. **Rebuild Trust Through Actions**
   - Trust is rebuilt through consistent, honest behavior over time. Be transparent, keep your promises, and show through your actions that you’re committed to change. This won’t happen overnight, but small, consistent efforts can help.

### 5. **Communicate Openly**
   - Have an honest conversation about how both of you are feeling. Ask him what he needs from you to rebuild trust, and share your own feelings about the relationship. Be prepared for difficult conversations.

### 6. **Assess the Relationship**
   - If he’s constantly criticizing you and unwilling to move forward, it’s worth considering whether this relationship is healthy for either of you. A relationship without trust or mutual respect can become toxic.

### 7. **Reflect on Your Own Needs**
   - Think about why you acted the way you did and what you truly want from this relationship. If you were trying to ""get back at him,"" it might indicate unresolved issues or unmet needs that need to be addressed.

   - If you both want to work on the relationship but are struggling, couples counseling can provide a safe space to address these issues with the help of a neutral third party.

### 9. **Be Prepared for Any Outcome**
   - Rebuilding trust is a two-way street, and he may ultimately decide he can’t move past this. If that happens, it’s important to respect his decision and focus on learning from this experience for future relationships.

### 10. **Work on Yourself**
   - Use this as an opportunity for personal growth. Reflect on what led to your actions and how you can handle conflict or hurt in healthier ways moving forward.

What should I do?","Oh Chino, I only have half the picture here so I will be cautious. There's a chicken and an egg, and I don't know which came first. One thing I see clearly is that your fiance will always have to have communications with his ex, because they have children. Can you accept that? When suspicion and insecurity come along, your job is to look at the big picture and the real picture. Is there any real evidence that he is cheating? Remember that texting his ex is not evidence alone if the communications are about the kids. Has he earned your trust? If so, then it's not fair to punish him for the betrayals of others. He's not your ex. Reassure your heart that you are his priority if the larger evidence supports that. At the same time, you can let him know what your triggers are. For example, hiding his phone doesn't send you a good message, right? See, this is the chicken and the egg...is he hiding the phone because you've been overreacting when he gets a text?  So let him know you won't blow up about him getting a text if he doesn't conceal or password his phone. Transparency helps build trust. You have sensitivities, and it helps you a lot if he's aware of them and willing to try not to do things that trigger fear. Let him know when you get scared, and hopefully he'll give you the openness and security you need in order to trust him and act as if you trust him.  :)","It sounds like you're in a challenging situation, and it's important to approach it with honesty, empathy, and clear communication. Here are some steps you can take to address the issue:

1. **Reflect on Your Feelings**: Before talking to your fiancé, take some time to understand your own emotions. Are you feeling insecure because of your past experiences, or are there specific behaviors from your fiancé that are causing concern? It’s important to differentiate between past trauma and current red flags.

2. **Communicate Openly**: Have an honest and calm conversation with your fiancé. Share your feelings without accusing or blaming him. For example, you could say, ""I’ve noticed you’ve been texting your ex a lot, and it’s making me feel uneasy. Can we talk about it?""

3. **Express Your Concerns**: Let him know why his behavior is troubling you. For instance, hiding his phone and texting his ex might feel like secrecy, which can trigger trust issues. Be specific about what you’re uncomfortable with and why.

4. **Listen to His Perspective**: Give him a chance to explain his actions. There may be valid reasons for his communication with his ex, especially since they share children. Understanding his side can help you both find common ground.

5. **Set Boundaries**: If his relationship with his ex is making you uncomfortable, discuss and agree on boundaries that feel fair to both of you. For example, you might ask for transparency about their communication or limit discussions to topics related to their children.

6. **Rebuild Trust**: If trust has been damaged, work together to rebuild it. This might involve small steps, like being more open about your lives or spending quality time together to strengthen your bond.

7. **Consider Counseling**: If the issue persists or feels too overwhelming to handle on your own, couples counseling can be a helpful way to address trust and communication challenges with the guidance of a neutral third party.

8. **Evaluate the Relationship**: Ultimately, trust and respect are the foundation of any healthy relationship. If your fiancé is unwilling to address your concerns or continues behaviors that make you feel uneasy, it may be worth reconsidering the relationship.

Remember, it’s okay to prioritize your emotional well-being and seek a partnership where you feel secure and valued.",0.4312283992767334

I also wanted to know if they enjoy their job and how long they were in school.,"It's a great idea for you to reach out to find a psychologist to talk to if this is a field you might be interested in pursuing. Regarding the length of schooling, it generally takes 4 years of college and an additional 4 to 7 years of graduate school to earn a doctorate degree to become a psychologist. There are also other similar professions, including counseling that don't require a doctorate degree. Licensed counselors generally completed 4 years of college and an additional 2 years of graduate school. If you are thinking about a career in psychology, the local APA chapter would be a good place to start to find a local psychologist to talk to.

1221,We've been dating for two months now. I have a heavy past that gets him angry. Does he have a right to penalize me for things I did before I met him?,"Not in my book. You're only two months in? At this early stage, this is a bit of a warning sign. If he can't accept or feel comfortable with who you are and decisions you've made, there's already a level of discomfort here that shouldn't be ignored. No, he doesn't have the right to penalize you or punish you ...not just for past things...not for anything. What he does get to do it tell you how it affects him. Sure...if he feels uncomfortable or needs reassurance...listen to those things. But If he doesn't dig who you are, maybe he can walk the other way.","It's important to approach this situation with empathy and clear communication. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Your Past Is Yours**: Your past experiences, mistakes, and choices are part of your journey and shaped who you are today. No one has the right to penalize or judge you for things that happened before they were in your life, as long as those actions don’t directly harm them or the relationship.

2. **Understanding His Feelings**: While he doesn’t have the right to penalize you, it’s possible that he’s reacting out of insecurity, jealousy, or misunderstanding. It’s worth having an open, honest conversation about why your past upsets him and whether there’s a way to address his concerns without making you feel judged.

3. **Healthy Boundaries**: A healthy relationship is built on mutual respect and understanding. If he’s using your past as a reason to control, shame, or punish you, that’s a red flag. You deserve to be with someone who accepts you for who you are, including your past.

4. **Communication Is Key**: Share how his reactions make you feel. Let him know that while you’re open to discussing your past, it’s not fair for him to hold it against you. A loving partner should strive to support and understand you, not make you feel guilty for things beyond their control.

5. **Evaluate the Relationship**: If he continues to penalize you or refuses to work through his feelings, it might be a sign that he’s not ready for a healthy, mature relationship. You deserve someone who values you for who you are now and doesn’t dwell on your past.

Remember, you are not defined by your past, and a loving partner should focus on building a positive future with you, not punishing you for what’s already happened.",0.48148250579833984
3063,"My roommate has had a drinking problem for a while. She goes out, gets trashed, and then expects everyone to take care of her. The next morning, she apologizes constantly until she feels validated. She also thinks everyone hates her all the time. If I don't seem anything other than happy, she asks me ""Do you hate me? You hate me. Tell me you love me,"" and I feel like I have to pity her because she has also been suicidal before.","It does sound like your roommate may have a drinking problem, and the short answer is that you can't do anything about it, only she can. We can't change what other people say, think, or do. We can only change our reactions. It does sound like your roommate may be having a hard time. You can suggest that she enter counseling or therapy. You can reassure her that you like her (if that's true), but you don't have to pity her.","It sounds like you’re in a very challenging and emotionally draining situation. Your roommate’s behavior—her drinking, emotional dependency, and self-loathing—is not only affecting her but also taking a toll on you. It’s important to recognize that while you can care about her, you are not responsible for her well-being or her choices. Here are some steps you can take to navigate this situation while protecting your own mental health:

---

### 1. **Set Boundaries**
   - **Be Clear and Kind:** Let her know that while you care about her, you cannot continue to take care of her when she’s drunk or constantly reassure her. For example, you might say, “I care about you, but I can’t keep staying up late to help you when you’ve been drinking. It’s affecting my own well-being.”
   - **Stick to Your Boundaries:** If she tries to guilt or manipulate you, remind yourself that setting boundaries is healthy and necessary.

---

### 2. **Encourage Professional Help**
   - **Gently Suggest Therapy:** Let her know that her struggles with drinking, self-esteem, and suicidal thoughts are serious and that a therapist or counselor could provide the support she needs. You could say, “I’ve noticed you’ve been really struggling, and I think talking to a professional could help you feel better.”
   - **Offer Resources:** If she’s open to it, help her find local support groups (like AA) or mental health resources.

---

### 3. **Avoid Enabling**
   - **Don’t Tiptoe Around Her Feelings:** While it’s kind to be compassionate, constantly reassuring her or taking care of her when she’s drunk may enable her behavior. It’s okay to say, “I don’t hate you, but I’m not in the mood to talk right now,” or even, “I’m not responsible for how you feel about yourself.”
   - **Let Her Face Consequences:** If she’s hungover or upset because of her drinking, resist the urge to “fix” it for her. Sometimes, facing the consequences of her actions can be a wake-up call.

---

### 4. **Take Care of Yourself**
   - **Prioritize Your Well-Being:** Living with someone who is struggling can be exhausting. Make sure you’re taking time for yourself, whether that’s through hobbies, exercise, or spending time with supportive friends.
   - **Seek Support:** Consider talking to a therapist or counselor yourself to process your feelings and learn how to handle this situation in a healthy way.

---

### 5. **Know Your Limits**
   - **Consider Your Living Situation:** If her behavior continues to negatively impact your life, it may be worth thinking about whether this living arrangement is sustainable for you. Your mental health matters too.

---

### 6. **Emergency Situations**
   - **Take Suicidal Threats Seriously:** If she expresses suicidal thoughts or intentions, don’t hesitate to call emergency services or a crisis hotline. You are not equipped to handle this alone, and professionals can provide the help she needs.

---

### Final Thoughts
It’s clear that you care about your roommate, but you can’t pour from an empty cup. Supporting someone with a drinking problem and mental health struggles is incredibly difficult, and it’s okay to acknowledge that you’re not her therapist or savior. By setting boundaries, encouraging her to seek help, and taking care of yourself, you’re doing the best you can in a tough situation.",0.5092219710350037
3499,"After first meeting the client, what is the process that a counselor facilitates?","Hi.  This is an excellent question !   I think that the answer probably varies depending upon the particular therapist .  In my work with people , once we have met and I have gotten an idea of the person'a concerns and the issues they want help with , I spend the next few sessions gathering as much history and as much information about the client's current concerns in order to formulate some ideas about what may be causing distress .  I would then share my thoughts with the client to see if they feel I am understanding them and on the right track.  We would then discuss the best plan to address the client's concerns .  Usually I will suggest strategies that I think may be helpful and ask the client for feedback about whether or not they think my suggestions feel helpful .   I always encourage clients to be really honest with me about this.  I tell them that I would hate for them to agree to try things that they know they won't try just to avoid ""hurting my feelings"" or ""offending me.""  I want to be helpful and while I have the expertise as far as typically helpful  strategies, I really like to work collaboratively and have clients tell me what they do and don't like / agree with or not agree with when I share my thoughts about a treatment plan .  We the   work together to come up with a plan that will be helpful , but also realistic and then revise it and try new things if necessary as we go along.   If things aren't improving , I am very happy and willing to try something new ! I hope this is helpful for you ! ","After the initial meeting with a client, a counselor typically facilitates a structured process to ensure effective support and progress. This process generally includes the following steps:

1. **Assessment and Information Gathering**:  
   - The counselor gathers detailed information about the client’s concerns, history, and goals.  
   - This may involve formal assessments, questionnaires, or open-ended discussions to understand the client’s needs.

2. **Establishing Rapport and Trust**:  
   - Building a strong therapeutic relationship is crucial. The counselor creates a safe, nonjudgmental space for the client to feel comfortable sharing.

3. **Identifying Goals**:  
   - Collaboratively, the counselor and client define clear, realistic goals for therapy. These goals guide the direction of future sessions.

4. **Developing a Treatment Plan**:  
   - Based on the assessment and goals, the counselor creates a tailored treatment plan. This plan outlines the strategies, techniques, and timeline for addressing the client’s concerns.

5. **Providing Psychoeducation**:  
   - The counselor may educate the client about their issues, the therapeutic process, and coping strategies to empower them.

6. **Implementing Interventions**:  
   - The counselor uses evidence-based techniques (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness, etc.) to address the client’s challenges.

7. **Monitoring Progress**:  
   - Regularly reviewing progress toward goals helps ensure the therapy is effective. Adjustments to the treatment plan are made as needed.

8. **Termination and Follow-Up**:  
   - When goals are met, the counselor prepares the client for the end of therapy, ensuring they have the tools to maintain progress. Follow-up sessions may be scheduled if necessary.

Throughout this process, the counselor maintains ethical standards, confidentiality, and a client-centered approach to support the client’s well-being.",0.3970077633857727
2740,I feel really uncomfortable when I have people's attention.  It makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class. Can I get over this social anxiety?,"Since anxiety usually about anticipating a bad result, or fear of being judged negatively, as though having failed some sort of test, consider what would give you the feeling of anticipating a good result from talking to an audience?Maybe, for example, if you prepared and rehearsed your talk more than what you typically would, you'd feel more secure in speaking  in front of an audience.Once you sort through your particular reason as to the source of your discomfort, it may feel more manageable.Yes, social anxiety can change.  You may naturally prefer smaller groups than an audience.And, it is possible to decrease anxiety in what may always be somewhat uncomfortable for you.","Yes, you absolutely can work through and manage social anxiety. It's a common experience, and many people have found ways to overcome or reduce their discomfort in social situations. Here are some strategies that might help:

### 1. **Understand Your Anxiety**
   - Recognize that social anxiety is rooted in fear of judgment or negative evaluation. Remind yourself that most people are focused on themselves, not on you.
   - Challenge negative thoughts by asking yourself, “What’s the worst that could happen?” Often, the reality is less scary than your fear.

### 2. **Start Small**
   - Gradually expose yourself to situations that make you uncomfortable. For example:
     - Practice speaking up in small, low-pressure settings, like with friends or family.
     - Raise your hand in class to answer a question you’re confident about.
   - Celebrate small victories to build confidence.

### 3. **Prepare and Practice**
   - If you know you’ll be in a situation where you’ll need to speak (e.g., a class discussion), prepare what you want to say in advance.
   - Practice speaking in front of a mirror or record yourself to get comfortable with your voice and delivery.

### 4. **Focus on Breathing**
   - When you feel anxious, your body may react with a racing heart or shallow breathing. Practice deep breathing exercises to calm your nervous system.
   - Try inhaling for 4 seconds, holding for 4 seconds, and exhaling for 6 seconds.

### 5. **Shift the Focus**
   - Instead of worrying about how you’re being perceived, focus on the conversation or the task at hand. For example, in class, think about the content of the discussion rather than how you sound.

### 6. **Challenge Perfectionism**
   - Remind yourself that it’s okay to make mistakes or not have the perfect answer. Most people are understanding and won’t judge you harshly.

### 7. **Seek Support**
   - Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor about your anxiety. They can offer encouragement and help you work through your feelings.
   - Consider joining a support group or taking a public speaking class to practice in a safe environment.

### 8. **Professional Help**
   - If your anxiety feels overwhelming or interferes with your daily life, consider reaching out to a therapist. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is particularly effective for social anxiety.

### 9. **Be Patient with Yourself**
   - Overcoming social anxiety takes time and effort. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and don’t be discouraged by setbacks.

### 10. **Practice Self-Compassion**
   - Remind yourself that it’s okay to feel uncomfortable. Treat yourself with kindness and avoid self-criticism.

Remember, you’re not alone in feeling this way, and many people have successfully managed their social anxiety. With practice and persistence, you can build confidence and feel more comfortable in social situations.",0.45154643058776855
2633,"I've been with him for a couple months. We will talk everyday and he will get mad over something I will say and not talk to me. We have our great moments, but I just need to focus on my personal situations, and I feel he is slowing me down with that. I still wanna be with him, but not now.","I have learned that the best approach is to say that you need the time to get yourself together, mature, learn, outside of a intimate relationship but just in a friend to friend relationship...don't blame him or point fingers at him.... most likely if you did that it would not go well.  If you make it about you and that you want the best for him while you work on self, it would be taken better.  ","It sounds like you're in a bit of a complicated situation, and it's great that you're reflecting on what you need personally and in the relationship. Here are a few thoughts that might help you navigate this:

1. **Communicate Your Feelings Openly**: If you haven’t already, it’s important to have an honest conversation with him about how you’re feeling. Let him know that you care about him but that you need space to focus on your personal goals and well-being. Be clear about your needs without blaming or accusing him.

2. **Set Boundaries**: If his reactions (like getting mad and giving you the silent treatment) are affecting your mental health or progress, it’s okay to set boundaries. Let him know what behavior is unacceptable and how it impacts you. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and understanding.

3. **Prioritize Yourself**: It’s okay to prioritize your personal growth and well-being. If you feel like the relationship is slowing you down, taking a step back might be the best thing for both of you. You can’t pour from an empty cup, so focusing on yourself first is essential.

4. **Consider the Relationship Dynamics**: Reflect on whether this relationship is truly healthy for you. While every relationship has ups and downs, frequent anger or silent treatment can be signs of unhealthy communication patterns. Ask yourself if this is the kind of dynamic you want long-term.

5. **Take a Break if Needed**: If you feel overwhelmed, it’s okay to take a break from the relationship. You can let him know that you need time to focus on yourself and that you’re not ending things permanently, but you need space to grow.

6. **Reevaluate Later**: After you’ve had time to focus on yourself, you can reassess whether this relationship aligns with your goals and needs. Sometimes, taking a step back can give you clarity about what you truly want.

Remember, a healthy relationship should support your growth, not hinder it. It’s okay to put yourself first, especially when you’re working on personal goals or navigating challenging situations. Take care of yourself, and trust your instincts.",0.5193131566047668
410,"When I get talked to by my dad or stepmom, or if I'm in trouble, I will begin to cry and not say what's wrong with me. When my dad or stepmom ask what is wrong, I never know the answers or the words to put together what is actually wrong with me.","Maybe you need more time to reflect and organize your thoughts.Try to figure out what would make you feel more relaxed about talking to your dad or stepmom.Also its possible you simply don't feel safe around either of them and so intuitively realize you're better off not talking with them about a delicate matter.Depending on whether you trust talking to dad and stepmom, you may simply wish to excuse yourself from speaking about yourself.There's no good reason to be heartfelt with people whom you don't feel are willing to accept or understand who you are.","It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of emotions in those moments, and it’s completely okay to feel overwhelmed. Crying can be a natural response when you’re feeling stressed, upset, or unsure of how to express yourself. Here are some things that might help:

### 1. **Understand Your Feelings**
   - It’s possible that you’re feeling emotions like fear, frustration, sadness, or even confusion, and those feelings can make it hard to think clearly. Try to take a moment to identify what you’re feeling. For example, are you scared of getting in trouble? Are you upset because you feel misunderstood? Naming the emotion can sometimes make it easier to explain.

### 2. **Take a Pause**
   - If you feel like you’re about to cry or can’t find the words, it’s okay to ask for a moment to collect yourself. You could say something like, “I need a minute to think about how I feel.” Taking a few deep breaths can also help calm your emotions.

### 3. **Write It Down**
   - If it’s hard to speak in the moment, try writing down your thoughts beforehand or afterward. This can help you organize your feelings and figure out what you want to say. You could even show what you’ve written to your dad or stepmom if talking feels too hard.

### 4. **Practice What to Say**
   - Sometimes, practicing how to express yourself can make it easier. You could rehearse in your mind or with someone you trust. For example, “I feel upset because…” or “I’m not sure why I’m crying, but I just feel overwhelmed.”

### 5. **Ask for Help**
   - If you’re unsure why you’re feeling this way, it’s okay to say that. You could say something like, “I’m not sure what’s wrong, but I’m feeling really emotional right now.” This lets them know you’re trying to figure it out too.

### 6. **Be Kind to Yourself**
   - It’s important to remember that it’s okay to feel this way. You’re not alone, and many people struggle to express their emotions in the moment. Be patient with yourself as you work on finding ways to communicate.

### 7. **Talk to Someone You Trust**
   - If this happens often, it might help to talk to someone else you trust, like a friend, teacher, or counselor. They can help you work through your feelings and come up with strategies to communicate better.

Remember, your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to take your time to figure out how to express them. You’re doing your best, and that’s what matters.",0.5392585396766663

How can I deal with being bullied at school when the teachers won't help?","To be bullied is very painful.I'm glad you know the bullies are doing the wrong thing and whatever they are telling you is pure meanness.Depending on how independent you feel, why not tell either your classroom teacher or schedule an appointment with the vice principal?Bullying other students is taken very seriously in some states and schools are expected to address the bullying until the victimized student feels safe.If you hesitate to do this on your own, then would you ask either of your parents or even a friend of yours who is also in the school, to report the problem?In case you are afraid the bullies will retaliate for reporting them, then tell this to whatever school authority you decide to ask for help.You're entitled to be protected by your school.","I’m so sorry you’ve been going through this. Bullying is incredibly painful, and it’s especially hard when it feels like no one is stepping in to help. You deserve to feel safe and supported. Here are some steps you can take to address the situation and take care of yourself:

---

### **1. Document the Bullying**
- Keep a detailed record of each incident, including dates, times, what happened, and who was involved. This can be helpful if you decide to escalate the issue.
- Save any evidence, such as messages, photos, or videos.

---

### **2. Seek Support from Trusted Adults**
- If teachers aren’t helping, try reaching out to other school staff, like a counselor, principal, or even a trusted coach or mentor.
- Talk to your parents or guardians. They can advocate for you and push the school to take action.

---

### **3. Know Your Rights**
- Many schools have anti-bullying policies in place. Research your school’s policies and remind administrators of their responsibility to protect you.
- If the school continues to ignore the issue, consider contacting your school district’s office or a local advocacy organization for help.

---

### **4. Build a Support System**
- Surround yourself with friends or classmates who care about you and make you feel safe.
- Join clubs or activities where you can meet people who share your interests.

---

### **5. Practice Self-Care**
- Find healthy ways to cope with your emotions, like journaling, drawing, listening to music, or exercising.
- If you’re feeling extremely sad, consider talking to a mental health professional. You don’t need a formal diagnosis to seek help—they can provide support and coping strategies.

---

### **6. Stand Up for Yourself (If Safe)**
- If you feel comfortable, calmly and firmly tell the bully to stop. Bullies often target people they think won’t push back.
- Avoid engaging in arguments or physical confrontations—your safety comes first.

---

### **7. Consider External Resources**
- If the school still doesn’t take action, you can file a complaint with your local education authority or seek legal advice.
- Organizations like [StopBullying.gov](https://www.stopbullying.gov) or [Childline](https://www.childline.org.uk) (if you’re in the UK) offer resources and support.

---

### **8. Remember It’s Not Your Fault**
- Bullying is never your fault. It’s about the bully’s behavior, not your worth or value.
- You are strong for enduring this, and things can get better.

---

### **9. Focus on Your Future**
- School is just one chapter of your life. While it’s important to address the bullying now, try to focus on your goals and dreams for the future.

1756,"Sometimes, when I look at my pet cat, I think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him. It makes me sad because I love him, but I always think about how helpless he is. There've even been split-seconds where I felt almost tempted to kick him, followed by shame and guilt.","A lot of different things could be happening here. Do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is? If you have not actually kicked him, then I would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt, since you did not hurt him. What else is there?It would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you. It could be that you feel safe with your cat, so strong emotions come up because you feel safe.","It's completely understandable to feel a mix of emotions when thinking about your pet's vulnerability, especially because you care deeply for him. The protective instincts you have for your cat show how much you love him, and it's natural to feel sadness or anxiety when imagining harm coming to him. These feelings often stem from a place of empathy and a desire to keep him safe.

The fleeting, intrusive thoughts you described—like the momentary urge to kick him—are actually quite common and are often referred to as ""intrusive thoughts."" These thoughts can feel disturbing, but they don’t reflect your true intentions or character. In fact, the fact that you feel shame and guilt afterward shows how much you value your cat and would never want to harm him. Intrusive thoughts are often a result of anxiety, stress, or even an overactive imagination, and they don’t define who you are or what you would actually do.

Here are a few things that might help:

1. **Acknowledge the thoughts without judgment**: Recognize that these thoughts are just that—thoughts. They don’t mean you’re a bad person or that you’ll act on them. Let them pass without dwelling on them.

2. **Focus on your actions**: Remind yourself of how you actually treat your cat. Your care and love for him are what truly matter.

3. **Practice mindfulness or grounding techniques**: If these thoughts become overwhelming, try grounding exercises like deep breathing or focusing on something in the present moment to help calm your mind.

4. **Talk to someone**: If these thoughts persist or cause significant distress, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you explore these feelings and develop strategies to manage them.

2335,"When I see something I don’t like, I go off like a ticking time bomb. I go from “0 to 100” really quickly.","Sometimes we react to situations immediately, without thinking of the consequences of our actions. Typically by not reacting right away, we are better able to gather our thoughts, see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives, and respond more calmly. One of the strategies that almost always helps is deep breathing. When faced with a stressful situation, you can give yourself a time out by removing yourself from the stress and spend 5 minutes taking deep breaths (breathe in slowly counting to 4 and breathe out even slower counting to 6), while focusing and thinking only about your breathing. After doing so, think of the various ways you can respond to the situation and choose the one most appropriate. Good luck!","It sounds like you’re describing intense emotional reactions that feel overwhelming and difficult to manage. Going from ""0 to 100"" quickly can be exhausting for you and those around you, and it might leave you feeling regretful or out of control afterward. The good news is that there are ways to work on managing these reactions and finding healthier ways to respond.

Here are some strategies to help you slow down and regain control when you feel that emotional surge:

### 1. **Pause and Breathe**
   - When you feel yourself starting to react, take a deep breath (or several). Focus on slowing your breathing to calm your nervous system. Try counting to 10 or using a grounding technique like the ""5-4-3-2-1"" method (identify 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, and 1 you taste).

### 2. **Identify Triggers**
   - Reflect on what typically sets off these intense reactions. Is it criticism, feeling disrespected, or something else? Understanding your triggers can help you prepare for them and respond more calmly.

### 3. **Practice Self-Awareness**
   - Pay attention to the physical signs that you’re about to ""go off"" (e.g., racing heart, clenched fists, raised voice). Recognizing these early warning signs can help you intervene before your emotions escalate.

### 4. **Challenge Your Thoughts**
   - Ask yourself: *Is this as big of a deal as I’m making it out to be?* or *What’s the worst that could happen?* Sometimes, our initial reaction is disproportionate to the situation.

### 5. **Use a Mantra**
   - Have a calming phrase or reminder ready, like *""Stay calm, it’s not worth it""* or *""I can handle this without losing control.""* Repeat it to yourself when you feel your emotions rising.

### 6. **Take a Time-Out**
   - If you’re in a situation where you feel like you’re about to explode, excuse yourself if possible. Step away to cool down and collect your thoughts before responding.

### 7. **Communicate Effectively**
   - Once you’ve calmed down, express your feelings in a way that’s assertive but not aggressive. Use ""I"" statements, like *""I feel upset when…""* instead of blaming or accusing others.

### 8. **Practice Mindfulness or Meditation**
   - Regular mindfulness practices can help you become more aware of your emotions and less reactive in the moment. Even a few minutes a day can make a difference.

### 9. **Seek Professional Help**
   - If you find that your reactions are causing significant distress or affecting your relationships, consider talking to a therapist. They can help you explore the root causes of your anger and develop personalized coping strategies.

### 10. **Be Patient with Yourself**
   - Changing how you react takes time and practice. Celebrate small victories, like catching yourself before you explode or handling a situation more calmly than you would have in the past.

Remember, it’s okay to feel strong emotions—they’re a natural part of being human. The key is learning how to express them in a way that aligns with your values and doesn’t leave you feeling out of control. You’ve already taken a great step by recognizing the pattern—now you can work on building healthier responses.",0.4917398691177368

1675,"He's been losing feelings and he doesn't know why. I love him very very much. He sometimes thinks I'm obsessed when I'm not at all. I give him his space and I make sure he's okay but sometimes I think if me and him saw each other more it would be better? I truly want me and him to get better, it's kind of hard not to stress about it, because the love of my life is losing feelings which is a sad feeling. He's a great guy! I just don't know why he's been losing feelings towards me. He's starting to put less effort in talking to me. At this point I'll do anything to just make us better as a couple. I tried talking to him but he doesn't like talking about it much. Advice on what to do?","I'm willing to bet that this isn't what you are hoping to hear, but I'd suggest giving him space. Ooph, that's a tough one, right?! I know. But here's the thing, when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away. He needs to feel like a solid and whole person (as you do too) to be able to be fully in your relationship. It's the work of being in relationship to learn this. I get that this is tough stuff. I wonder, outside of being with him, how do you soothe and calm yourself? That's the stuff for you to tune into and focus on right now.","I’m so sorry you’re going through this—it’s incredibly painful to feel like the person you love is pulling away. It’s clear how much you care about him and want to make things work. Here’s some advice to help you navigate this situation:

---

### 1. **Focus on Yourself First**
   - It’s easy to pour all your energy into fixing the relationship, but it’s important to take care of your own emotional well-being. Spend time doing things that make you happy, whether it’s hobbies, spending time with friends, or practicing self-care.
   - When you’re in a good place emotionally, you’ll be better equipped to handle the challenges in the relationship.

---

### 2. **Give Him Space (Without Overthinking It)**
   - It sounds like you’re already giving him space, which is great. Continue to respect his need for independence. Sometimes, people pull away because they feel overwhelmed or need time to process their emotions.
   - Avoid overcompensating by trying to “fix” things or seeking constant reassurance. This can sometimes create more pressure and push him further away.

---

### 3. **Communicate Openly (But Gently)**
   - While he may not like talking about it, it’s important to express how you’re feeling in a calm and non-confrontational way. Use “I” statements to avoid making him feel defensive. For example:
     - “I’ve noticed we’ve been a little distant lately, and I just want to make sure we’re both feeling okay.”
     - “I love you and want us to work through this together. Is there anything on your mind that you’d like to share?”
   - Be prepared for the possibility that he may not have all the answers or may need more time to open up.

---

### 4. **Reignite the Connection**
   - Sometimes, relationships lose their spark because routines become too predictable or life gets in the way. Try to create new, positive experiences together:
     - Plan a fun date or activity that you both enjoy.
     - Surprise him with something thoughtful (but not overwhelming) to show you care.
     - Focus on quality time rather than quantity—make the moments you do spend together meaningful.

---

### 5. **Accept What You Can’t Control**
   - As hard as it is, you can’t force someone to feel a certain way. Relationships require effort from both sides, and if he’s not willing to put in the work, it may be a sign that he’s not as invested as you are.
   - Remind yourself that his feelings (or lack thereof) are not a reflection of your worth. You deserve someone who values and reciprocates your love.

---

### 6. **Prepare for All Outcomes**
   - It’s important to be honest with yourself about the possibility that this relationship may not work out. While it’s painful to think about, it’s better to face reality than to hold onto something that’s no longer fulfilling for both of you.
   - If he continues to pull away and isn’t willing to communicate or work on the relationship, you may need to consider whether staying in the relationship is the healthiest choice for you.

---

### 7. **Seek Support**
   - Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist about what you’re going through. Having someone to lean on can help you process your emotions and gain perspective.

---

Remember, love should feel mutual and fulfilling. While it’s natural to want to fight for the relationship, it’s equally important to ensure that your own needs and happiness are being met. Take things one step at a time, and trust that you’ll find your way through this, no matter the outcome. 💛",0.5168460011482239
2756,"I believe my partner has a masturbation and porn problem. He masturbates daily, even when I am lying in bed sleeping beside him. We have sex once a week. He is rough and worries about his needs. He never touches me, and treats me like a porn star, wanting to finish on my face or chest.","It sounds like your in quite a rough place, my recommendation just based on what you type might warrant a visit to a psychotherapist to resolve what may be going on, I am not entirely sure but it sounds like he might have a bit of a sex addiction problem. One thing you need to ask yourself is ""Am I happy?"", ""Do I feel loved?"", these are deep questions, but the answers to those questions will give you a direction to travel in. ","It sounds like you're feeling hurt, disconnected, and concerned about your partner's behavior and its impact on your relationship. Addressing this issue requires open communication, mutual understanding, and possibly professional support. Here are some steps you can consider:

### 1. **Reflect on Your Feelings**
   - Take some time to understand how his behavior is affecting you emotionally, physically, and mentally. Are you feeling disrespected, neglected, or objectified? Clarifying your feelings will help you communicate them effectively.

### 2. **Initiate a Calm and Honest Conversation**
   - Choose a time when you both are relaxed and not distracted. Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings without blaming or accusing. For example:
     - ""I feel hurt and disconnected when you masturbate beside me while I’m sleeping.""
     - ""I feel uncomfortable when our sexual interactions focus only on your needs and don’t include intimacy or affection.""
   - Be specific about how his behavior impacts you and your relationship.

### 3. **Discuss Your Sexual Relationship**
   - Share your desires and needs for intimacy, affection, and mutual satisfaction in your sexual relationship. Ask him about his feelings and needs as well.
   - If his behavior is influenced by porn consumption, discuss how it might be shaping his expectations and actions. For example:
     - ""I’ve noticed that our sexual interactions seem to mimic porn, and it makes me feel like my needs aren’t being considered.""

### 4. **Set Boundaries**
   - If his behavior is crossing your boundaries (e.g., masturbating while you’re asleep), clearly express what you’re comfortable with and what you’re not.
   - For example: ""I’m not comfortable with you masturbating while I’m sleeping. I’d like us to respect each other’s space in that way.""

### 5. **Address Potential Porn or Masturbation Addiction**
   - If you believe his behavior is compulsive or excessive, gently suggest that it might be worth exploring whether he has an unhealthy relationship with porn or masturbation. Avoid labeling or shaming him, but express concern for his well-being and your relationship.
   - For example: ""I’m concerned that your daily masturbation and porn use might be affecting our intimacy. Have you thought about why you feel the need to do this so often?""

### 6. **Seek Professional Help**
   - If the issue persists or feels overwhelming, consider seeking the help of a couples therapist or sex therapist. A professional can help you both navigate these challenges and improve communication and intimacy.
   - If he is open to it, he might also benefit from individual therapy to address potential addiction or underlying issues.

### 7. **Take Care of Yourself**
   - Prioritize your emotional and mental well-being. If his behavior is causing you significant distress, consider setting boundaries to protect yourself, even if it means taking space from the relationship.
   - Surround yourself with supportive friends or family, and consider individual therapy to process your feelings and gain clarity.

### 8. **Evaluate the Relationship**
   - If your partner is unwilling to acknowledge your feelings, make changes, or seek help, you may need to evaluate whether this relationship is meeting your needs. A healthy relationship requires mutual respect, communication, and effort from both partners.

Remember, you deserve to feel valued, respected, and loved in your relationship. Addressing this issue may be challenging, but it’s an important step toward building a healthier and more fulfilling connection.",0.4967477321624756
443,"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","Please feel free to cry during therapy if you suddenly feel painful emotions arising when you describe some of your unsatisfying and unfulfilling relationships and situations.Crying when realizing the emotional hurt and unfairness between you and someone, clears you for new ways of handling interactions.As a therapist, I always have a box of tissues on the table next to the couch where people who utilize my therapy, sit.I hope you will soon discover that once your tears unlock your awareness of harmful relationships in your life, you will quickly see the freedom to establish new and happier patterns of relating.Have a good therapy!","First of all, it’s completely normal to feel nervous before starting therapy—it’s a big step, and it’s okay to feel vulnerable. Crying in therapy is *not* something to worry about or be embarrassed by. In fact, it’s incredibly common and often a sign that you’re processing emotions that need to be expressed. Therapists are trained to create a safe, nonjudgmental space for you to feel whatever you’re feeling, whether that’s sadness, anger, fear, or anything else.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. **Therapists are used to tears**: Crying is a natural and healthy response to emotional pain, and therapists see it all the time. They won’t judge you or think less of you for it.

2. **Crying can be healing**: Letting out emotions that you’ve been holding in can be a relief and an important part of the therapeutic process. It’s okay to let yourself feel.

3. **You’re in control**: If you’re worried about crying, you can let your therapist know how you’re feeling. They can help you navigate those emotions and make sure you feel safe.

4. **Embarrassment is normal, but it’s not necessary**: It’s okay to feel self-conscious, but remind yourself that therapy is a space where you don’t have to “perform” or hold it together. Your therapist is there to support you, not judge you.

It’s also worth noting that you don’t *have* to cry in therapy. Everyone processes emotions differently, and there’s no “right” way to do therapy. The most important thing is to show up and be honest with yourself and your therapist.

You’re taking a brave step by starting therapy, and it’s okay to feel nervous. Be kind to yourself—you’re doing something important for your well-being. You’ve got this!",0.4654322862625122
810,How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,This is a tough decision to make for anyone that has ever been involved in a relationship.  My advice is for you to consider what is making you unhappy in this relationship.  Sometimes we think we are ready to move on but don't know the reason why and then we regret it.  The worst thing you want after the fact is to have regret.  Take time to do some soul searching and imagine your life without this person before you make any decisions.  This will also help you understand what it is you are looking for in a romantic relationship. Best of luck in your love life. Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling,"Deciding whether to end a relationship is a deeply personal and often difficult decision. Here are some steps and considerations to help you reflect on your relationship and make a thoughtful choice:

### 1. **Assess Your Feelings**
   - Are you happy in the relationship most of the time, or do you feel consistently unhappy, drained, or unfulfilled?
   - Do you feel loved, respected, and valued by your partner?
   - Are you still emotionally invested in the relationship, or have you started to detach?

### 2. **Evaluate the Relationship Dynamics**
   - **Communication**: Do you and your boyfriend communicate openly and effectively? Are conflicts resolved in a healthy way, or do they escalate into arguments or silent treatment?
   - **Trust**: Is there mutual trust in the relationship, or have there been breaches of trust (e.g., dishonesty, infidelity)?
   - **Effort**: Are both of you putting in equal effort to maintain the relationship, or does it feel one-sided?
   - **Shared Values and Goals**: Do you align on important life values, such as family, career, or lifestyle? Are your long-term goals compatible?

### 3. **Identify Deal-Breakers**
   - Are there behaviors or patterns in the relationship that you consider deal-breakers (e.g., abuse, disrespect, lack of commitment)?
   - Have you tried to address these issues, and if so, has there been any meaningful change?

### 4. **Consider the Impact on Your Well-Being**
   - Does the relationship contribute positively to your mental, emotional, and physical health, or does it cause stress, anxiety, or unhappiness?
   - Are you able to be your authentic self in the relationship, or do you feel you have to compromise your identity or values?

### 5. **Reflect on Your Future**
   - Can you envision a future with your boyfriend that aligns with your aspirations and values?
   - Are you staying in the relationship out of love and commitment, or out of fear of being alone, societal pressure, or habit?

### 6. **Talk to Someone You Trust**
   - Share your thoughts and feelings with a trusted friend, family member, or therapist. They can offer an outside perspective and help you process your emotions.

### 7. **Communicate with Your Boyfriend**
   - If you’re unsure, consider having an honest conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns. His response may give you clarity about whether the relationship can improve.

### 8. **Trust Your Intuition**
   - Pay attention to your gut feelings. If something feels off or you’ve been questioning the relationship for a long time, it might be a sign that it’s not right for you.

### 9. **Take Your Time**
   - This is a significant decision, so don’t rush it. Give yourself the space to reflect and process your emotions.

### 10. **Prepare for the Outcome**
   - If you decide to end the relationship, think about how to approach the conversation with kindness and respect. If you choose to stay, consider what steps you can take to strengthen the relationship.

52,"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","The short answer is: absolutely not! The longer answer is that it might take some time to process all of the issues, and it may feel quite ""muddy"" in the issues for a lot longer than is tolerable (which is why counseling may have been postponed to begin with for you.) It's important to be realistic when entering counseling of any sort, and that the therapist be realistic with you about what you might be able to expect working with that person (I use the words ""might be able to expect"" because therapy experiences can vary.) But that not having counseling about trauma that you have experienced much earlier in your life can play a significant role in the process and how long that process could take to unpack all that may have been buried over time.It might also be helpful in counseling to work with the therapist on figuring out where to begin, but to also manage the feelings of being overwhelmed that may make it hard to continue to show up and do the work required, week in and week out. It isn't easy work trying to process past pain that you experienced, and so consistent practice of self-care, including leaning on support systems outside of therapy, is key.","First, I want to acknowledge the strength and resilience it takes to carry so much pain and still maintain a loving, long-term marriage. It’s clear that you’ve faced significant challenges in your life, and the fact that you’re considering counseling is a courageous step toward healing.  

To answer your question directly: **No, you do not have too many issues to address in counseling.** While it may feel overwhelming, counseling is designed to help people untangle complex and layered experiences like yours. A skilled therapist will work with you to prioritize your concerns, create a safe space for exploration, and help you develop tools to manage and heal from these challenges.  

Here’s how counseling can support you:  

1. **Sexual Abuse History:** Therapy can help you process the trauma, address any lingering emotional or psychological effects, and work toward reclaiming your sense of safety and self-worth.  

2. **Breast Cancer Survivorship:** Surviving cancer often comes with its own emotional and psychological burdens, including fear of recurrence, changes in body image, and grief. Counseling can help you navigate these feelings and find meaning in your experience.  

3. **Insomnia:** Chronic sleep issues can be deeply connected to mental health, and therapy can help you explore the root causes (e.g., anxiety, trauma) and develop strategies to improve sleep.  

4. **Depression and Anxiety:** Therapy can provide tools to manage symptoms, challenge negative thought patterns, and build a more positive outlook.  

5. **Low Self-Esteem:** Counseling can help you identify and challenge the beliefs or experiences that contribute to low self-esteem, fostering a healthier relationship with yourself.  

6. **Support in a Stable Marriage:** While your marriage is a source of happiness, therapy can still help you explore how past experiences may impact your relationship and strengthen your emotional connection with your partner.  

**Where to Start:**  
- **Find the Right Therapist:** Look for a therapist who specializes in trauma, chronic illness, and mental health. Someone with experience in these areas will be better equipped to support you.  
- **Take It Step by Step:** You don’t have to address everything at once. Therapy is a process, and you can work on one issue at a time or explore how they intersect.  
- **Be Patient with Yourself:** Healing is not linear, and it’s okay to take your time.  

You’ve already shown incredible strength by considering counseling. Remember, you don’t have to face these challenges alone—therapy can be a powerful tool to help you heal and thrive. You deserve support, understanding, and peace.",0.42499005794525146

How can I get my life back?","Slowly is the rate at which you'll get back your life.Being traumatized means not feeling safe in almost all areas of life.Be patient with yourself as you try to regain trust that people will not harm you and will be sources of satisfaction in your life.It is possible that the trauma in your life requires such great attention on your part to your own inner emotional safety that you are better off with a less intensive job than the one you recently lost.Try to prioritize restoring your emotional and psychological health.  With this as the top area of your attention then you may have an easier time to accept a lesser degree of involvement in your work and relationships.When you feel angry, try to examine if underlying the anger are feelings of stress, fear, insecurity regarding your position in relationship to the person toward whom you feel angry.   Anger is often the surface reaction to more destabilizing emotions like fear and insecurity.Gradually by nurturing and comforting yourself, living at a pace which is uniquely comfortable to what and how much you can handle, you'll regain your trust in both yourself and relating to others.","I’m so sorry you’re going through this.

   - **Be Patient**: Healing from PTSD is a journey, and it’s okay to have setbacks.
   - **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge progress, no matter how small.
   - **Avoid Self-Blame**: PTSD is not your fault, and you’re doing the best you can.

---

### 8. **Consider Holistic Approaches**
   - **Yoga or Tai Chi**: These practices combine movement and mindfulness, which can reduce PTSD symptoms.
   - **Art or Music Therapy**: Creative outlets can help process emotions and trauma.
   - **Nature Therapy**: Spending time in nature can have a calming effect.

   - **Friends and Family**: Lean on trusted loved ones for emotional support.
   - **Hotlines and Crisis Resources**: If you’re feeling overwhelmed, contact a crisis hotline (e.g., National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, PTSD support lines).

### 10. **Take It One Step at a Time**
   Healing from PTSD is a process, and it’s okay to focus on one area at a time. You don’t have to do everything at once. Small, consistent steps can lead to meaningful change.

1748,I read that you should ignore them and they have to come to a conclusion that they were wrong on their own terms. Is that correct?,"It is not correct because someone who is narcissistic believes they are always right.If you ignore the person, then their thinking is that there is something wrong with you.Ignoring the person to the degree this is possible in the situation or relationship, will spare you to be misunderstood further.","The approach you're referring to—ignoring someone and waiting for them to come to a conclusion on their own—can be effective in certain situations, but it depends on the context and the individuals involved. Here’s a breakdown of when it might work and when it might not:

### When It Might Work:
1. **Emotional Conflicts**: In heated arguments, ignoring the issue temporarily can give both parties time to cool down and reflect on their behavior or stance.
2. **Attention-Seeking Behavior**: If someone is acting out or being unreasonable to get attention, ignoring them can remove the reinforcement for that behavior.
3. **Stubbornness**: Some people need time to process their mistakes or reconsider their position without feeling pressured or confronted.

### When It Might Not Work:
1. **Miscommunication**: Ignoring someone can lead to misunderstandings or resentment if the issue isn’t addressed directly.
2. **Important Issues**: For serious matters, avoiding the problem can make it worse. Open communication is often necessary to resolve conflicts.
3. **Personality Differences**: Some people may not reflect on their actions or behavior unless they are confronted directly.

### A Better Approach:
Instead of simply ignoring, consider these strategies:
- **Give Space**: Allow time for emotions to settle, but don’t completely avoid the issue.
- **Communicate Calmly**: When the time is right, express your feelings or perspective without being confrontational.
- **Encourage Reflection**: Ask open-ended questions to help the other person think about their actions or beliefs.

Ultimately, the goal is to foster understanding and resolution, whether that happens through time or direct conversation. Ignoring someone can sometimes lead to clarity, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution.",0.49916261434555054

I don't want to lose my wife but we need to have a space because we usually hit each other and it's not healthy. I'm dying to make our relationship healthy. I've never wanted anything more than this. Please help me. I need your advice.","Hello. It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight, and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage. I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now. Marriages take lots of work, and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young - good, bad, or indifferent. There are no easy answers to your questions, and I won't presume that my response to you will be the linch-pin that heals all your pain. But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. No one is perfect. We fail more often than we succeed, but in the end we learn, and that learning helps us grow. Yes, you're right, the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good, and need to stop. You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard, and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. Seeing a therapist for yourself, and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. You have issues that you need to resolve, that, while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life, they are separate from your marriage in many respects.Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. You can find these through local counseling resources. Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. If you belong to a religious or spiritual community, then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed, so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you.Lastly, parents are imperfect. Yep...its true. They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. We limp along and do our best. Having said that, we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future, no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid, and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. Both with ourselves, and toward other people. So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit.  I am sure that remains to be seen, but either way you both must be involved in saving it. If only one of you cares, then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. That's not fair. So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants, and work to create an amicable solution. All of this said, seek out supportive friends, and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life. One way or the other, you will benefit from it.Be well.","I’m so sorry you’re going through such a difficult time. It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of pain from your past, and it’s affecting your relationship with your wife. The good news is that you’re aware of the issues and want to make things better, which is a crucial first step. Here’s some guidance to help you navigate this situation:

---

### 1. **Acknowledge the Pain from Your Past**
   - It’s clear that your upbringing has left deep scars. The abuse, neglect, and abandonment you experienced have shaped your views on family and relationships. It’s okay to feel hurt, angry, or resentful about what happened, but it’s important to work through these emotions so they don’t continue to harm your present and future.
   - Consider seeking therapy or counseling to process these feelings. A therapist can help you heal from your past and develop healthier ways of coping and relating to others.

---

### 2. **Communicate Openly with Your Wife**
   - Misunderstandings and jumping to conclusions often stem from poor communication. Sit down with your wife and have an honest, calm conversation about how you’re feeling. Use “I” statements to express your emotions without blaming her (e.g., “I feel misunderstood when…” instead of “You always get it wrong”).
   - Listen to her perspective as well. Try to understand her family-oriented values and why they’re important to her, even if they don’t align with your own experiences.

---

### 3. **Set Boundaries Around Conflict**
   - Physical violence is never okay, and it’s a sign that the situation has escalated too far. Agree with your wife to take a step back when arguments become heated. Use phrases like, “Let’s take a break and come back to this when we’re calmer.”
   - If you’re struggling to control anger or frustration, consider anger management therapy or techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or journaling.

---

### 4. **Respect Each Other’s Differences**
   - You and your wife come from different backgrounds and have different values, and that’s okay. The key is to respect each other’s perspectives and find common ground. For example, while you may not be family-oriented, you can still support her connection to her family without feeling pressured to share the same level of involvement.

---

### 5. **Work on Building Trust**
   - Misunderstandings and assumptions can erode trust. Make an effort to be transparent with your wife about your feelings and intentions. If she jumps to conclusions, gently correct her and explain your true thoughts or feelings.
   - Trust also involves showing up for each other. Be consistent in your actions and words to demonstrate that you’re committed to the relationship.

---

### 6. **Consider Couples Therapy**
   - If you’re both willing, couples therapy can be incredibly helpful. A therapist can provide a safe space for you to work through your differences, improve communication, and develop healthier ways of resolving conflict.

---

### 7. **Focus on Self-Care**
   - You’ve been through a lot, and it’s important to take care of yourself. Engage in activities that bring you joy, spend time with your best friend, and practice self-compassion. Healing yourself will make it easier to nurture your relationship with your wife.

---

### 8. **Be Patient with Yourself and Your Wife**
   - Healing and rebuilding a relationship take time. There will be setbacks, but what matters is that you’re both committed to making things work. Celebrate small victories and keep working toward your shared goal of a healthier relationship.

---

### 9. **Reach Out for Support**
   - You don’t have to go through this alone. Lean on your best friend, consider joining a support group, or seek guidance from a trusted mentor or counselor. Having a support system can make a big difference.

---

### Final Thoughts:
Your desire to make your relationship healthy is a powerful starting point. By addressing your past, improving communication, and seeking professional help, you can create a stronger, more loving connection with your wife.

857,I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"The best way to move on is to give yourself sufficient time and space away from your ex so you can heal.  That means no checking out your ex on social media platforms and no contact.  In order to move on and diminish the obsessions, help yourself recognize and accept that the relationship is over, and make sure to get sufficient support in processing all your feelings.  Once that takes place, it can be useful to explore and process with a professional the meaning of the relationship and to understand your part in what transpired.Sometimes people obsess because they have difficulties accepting what's already taken place and want things to be different.  The key to moving forward is to be loving toward yourself, to give yourself permission to grieve the loss, and to start cultivating new and healthy habits/patterns.  Reengage in your present life, ask yourself what you want your life to look like, and start creating goals and taking small steps to create the amazing life you want for yourself.","I’m so sorry you’re going through this.

### 8. **Practice Mindfulness**
   - When memories or emotions arise, try to observe them without judgment. Techniques like deep breathing or meditation can help you stay grounded.

### 11. **Consider Professional Help**
   - If you’re struggling to cope, a therapist can provide tools and support tailored to your situation.

867,"I was in a relationship with a woman for four years. We both made mistakes, but I do love her.    She has moved in with another lady. I think she is just cheating on me to make me miss her. How can I find out for sure?","Has your former partner made any efforts to be in contact with you in order to restart your relationship?From what you describe, your former partner is in a new relationship.It is possible that since you love her and would like to be together again, that you are misinterpreting your former partner's actions.If you'd like to have more certainty as to wether your former partner is cheating or whether she is happy to be with the new partner, is to contact her and ask her your question.A better road may be to accept your sad feelings that she is with someone else.Since she was meaningful to you, respect the sadness you feel and that the relationship didn't continue as you wished.","I'm sorry you're going through this—it sounds like a difficult and emotionally challenging situation. Here are some steps you can take to gain clarity and handle this situation with care:

1. **Communicate Directly**: The best way to find out the truth is to have an honest and calm conversation with her. Ask her about her feelings, her relationship with this other person, and where she sees your relationship going. Avoid accusations and focus on understanding her perspective.

2. **Observe Her Behavior**: Pay attention to how she acts around you and the other person. Does she seem genuinely committed to this new relationship, or does she show signs of wanting to reconnect with you? Actions often speak louder than words.

139,My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.,"You should start by speaking with her about what has her so down. Have their been some significant events in her life that have affected her? Have their been significant events in your relationship that can be affecting  you both? If she just stopped drinking, she may be struggling to finding an alternative and healthier behavior. This is something the two of you can explore together. Also, if need be perhaps she can speak to a therapist to discuss her feelings about quitting alcohol. It sounds like you really care and right now she could use all the support she can get despite her pushing you away.","It’s great that you want to support your girlfriend during this challenging time. Quitting drinking can be a huge life change, and it’s not uncommon for people to experience emotional ups and downs as they adjust. Here are some ways you can help her while respecting her needs and feelings:

### 1. **Listen Without Judgment**
   - Let her express her feelings openly. Avoid offering solutions right away—just listen and validate her emotions.
   - Say things like, “I hear you,” or “That sounds really hard. I’m here for you.”

### 2. **Understand the Root of Her Depression**
   - Alcohol can mask underlying emotions or mental health issues. Now that she’s stopped drinking, those feelings may be surfacing.
   - Gently encourage her to explore these emotions, possibly with the help of a therapist or counselor.

### 3. **Be Patient with Her Recovery**
   - Quitting drinking is a process, and it can take time for her to feel stable and happy again. Avoid pressuring her to “snap out of it.”
   - Celebrate small victories, like days without alcohol or moments of positivity.

### 4. **Support Her Desire for Change**
   - If she wants to move, try to understand why. Is it because she’s seeking a fresh start? Does she feel stuck in her current environment?
   - Instead of immediately asking her to stay, explore what she’s looking for in a new place. Maybe you can work together to create a sense of change and renewal where you are.

### 5. **Encourage Healthy Habits**
   - Help her build a routine that supports her mental and physical health. This could include exercise, healthy eating, hobbies, or mindfulness practices.
   - Offer to join her in these activities to show your support.

### 6. **Suggest Professional Help**
   - If her depression persists or worsens, gently suggest she speak with a therapist or join a support group like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or SMART Recovery.
   - Offer to help her find resources or even accompany her to appointments if she’s open to it.

### 7. **Reassure Her of Your Commitment**
   - Let her know that you’re in this with her and that you’re committed to supporting her through this journey.
   - Say something like, “I care about you and want to help you through this. We can figure it out together.”

### 8. **Take Care of Yourself**
   - Supporting someone through depression and recovery can be emotionally taxing. Make sure you’re also taking time for self-care and seeking support if needed.

2963,"I'm feeling rejected and frustrated. This is not new. The first month we were together, sex was about every day. Then it slowed down to once a month right away. I love my husband, but I am struggling with this.","   Feeling rejected and frustrated is a reasonable reaction to your experience with your husband. I want to encourage you that his actions may have little to do with you, and regardless of outcomes, I hope you find the help you need to process through your pain and still have hope for your marriage.   If your husband was to work with me I'd explore with him his understanding of, and experience with, intimacy in relationship with others. Furthermore, like other male clients of mine, I'd challenge your husband to secure an updated full medical exam from his PCP (primary care physician) and/or urologist in order to identify or rule out any organic issues which may be causing his apparent lack of desire for sexual intimacy. If there are no physical issues, per se, I would encourage your husband to process further his family of origin story-line regarding rules, roles, sex, and sexuality along with working through his sexual and trauma histories. ","I'm so sorry you're feeling this way. It's understandable to feel rejected and frustrated when there's a significant change in your sexual intimacy, especially when it feels like a vital part of your connection has shifted. It’s important to acknowledge your feelings and know that you’re not alone in experiencing this kind of struggle.

Here are some steps that might help you navigate this situation:

### 1. **Open Communication**
   - Talk to your husband about how you’re feeling. Use “I” statements to express your emotions without placing blame, like, “I feel disconnected when we’re not intimate as often as we used to be.”
   - Ask him how he’s feeling and if there’s anything on his mind that might be contributing to the change. There could be stress, health issues, or other factors at play.

### 2. **Understand the Why**
   - Intimacy often changes over time in relationships, and there are many possible reasons for this shift. It could be stress, fatigue, hormonal changes, or even emotional disconnect.
   - Try to approach the situation with curiosity rather than judgment. Understanding the root cause can help you both work toward a solution.

### 3. **Reconnect Emotionally**
   - Sometimes, emotional intimacy needs to be rebuilt before physical intimacy can flourish. Spend quality time together doing things you both enjoy, and focus on strengthening your bond.
   - Small gestures of affection, like holding hands, hugging, or complimenting each other, can help rebuild that connection.

### 4. **Explore Other Forms of Intimacy**
   - Intimacy isn’t just about sex. Explore other ways to feel close, like cuddling, massages, or even deep conversations. This can help you both feel valued and connected.

### 5. **Consider Professional Help**
   - If this issue persists and feels unresolved, consider seeking help from a couples therapist or sex therapist. They can provide tools and strategies to help you both navigate this challenge.

### 6. **Take Care of Yourself**
   - It’s easy to feel rejected and let this affect your self-esteem. Remember that your worth isn’t tied to your sexual relationship. Focus on self-care and activities that make you feel good about yourself.

### 7. **Be Patient**
   - Change takes time, and it’s important to be patient with both yourself and your husband. Relationships evolve, and finding a new rhythm that works for both of you is possible.

You’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to feel frustrated. What matters is that you’re willing to work through it together. Your love for each other is a strong foundation, and with effort and understanding, you can find a way to reconnect and feel fulfilled in your relationship.",0.5169225335121155
712,"My daughter didn't see her biological father for the last three years. She doesn’t want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse. The visitation is with supervision, but she refuses to see him. Is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy?","Hi Dillon,I'm from Canada, so I don't know the laws in your state. It depends on that a good deal, perhaps. In my opinion, a child should never be forced into a situation where they feel unsafe, even if it is ""supervised"". If the child is old enough to make a strong statement about not wanting to see a parent, then this should be honoured. Unfortunately, the laws don't always uphold a parent's right to do what is best for their child. I recommend you see a lawyer, who will advise you about how to proceed without putting yourself at risk of breaching custody agreements.If you feel your daughter can benefit from therapy, that is a separate question. Or is she already in therapy? A family therapist will typically meet with you alone first, in order to determine if therapy is a wise move for your child. It isn't always appropriate.","I’m sorry to hear about the difficult situation you and your daughter are facing. It’s important to prioritize her emotional well-being and safety above all else. Here are some considerations and steps you might take:

1. **Therapy for Your Daughter**: Yes, taking your daughter to a therapist is a very good idea. A therapist who specializes in trauma, child psychology, or family dynamics can help her process her feelings and experiences in a safe and supportive environment. Therapy can also provide her with tools to cope with her emotions and help her navigate the complexities of her relationship with her father.

2. **Respect Her Wishes**: If your daughter is refusing to see her father, it’s important to take her feelings seriously. Forcing her into visitation could retraumatize her and damage her trust in you. A therapist can help assess whether visitation is in her best interest and at what pace she might be ready to engage, if at all.

3. **Legal Considerations**: If there is a court-ordered visitation arrangement, you may need to consult with your attorney to discuss your daughter’s refusal and the potential need to modify the order based on her emotional well-being. Courts often prioritize the best interests of the child, and a therapist’s evaluation could support your case.

4. **Supervised Visitation**: If supervised visitation is already in place, ensure that the supervisor is trained to handle sensitive situations and can intervene if necessary. However, even with supervision, if your daughter is adamant about not seeing her father, her wishes should be carefully considered.

5. **Focus on Healing**: Right now, your daughter’s healing and emotional health should be the priority. Therapy can help her process her trauma and decide, in time, whether she feels ready to have any kind of relationship with her father. It’s okay to take things slowly and let her lead the way when she’s ready.

6. **Support for You**: This is a challenging situation for you as well. Consider seeking support for yourself, whether through therapy, a support group, or trusted friends and family. Taking care of your own emotional health will help you better support your daughter.

In summary, therapy is a crucial step to help your daughter process her experiences and feelings. It’s important to respect her wishes and prioritize her emotional safety while navigating the legal and relational aspects of this situation. A therapist can guide you both in determining the best path forward.",0.4871528148651123

2. **Be genuine**: Let your curiosity and care shine through. Avoid overthinking or making it too formal.

3. **Be prepared for any response**: He might respond enthusiastically, or he might be busy or not as engaged. Either way, you’ll have taken a step forward, which is something to be proud of.

4. **Gauge his interest**: If he responds positively and seems interested in catching up, you can gradually deepen the conversation. If not, you’ll have closure and know you tried.

1423,"My parents seem okay with other sexualities, but normally they only talk about being gay. When they do talk about bisexuality, they say things like “they'll do anything” or things that make me very uncomfortable because I am bisexual. I don't know if I am ready to come out to them.","Perhaps you are not ready to come out to your parents.  Often times our readiness is not dependent on what others' will say or how they react. But more so dependent on how emotionally prepared we are to deal with others' reactions.  It may be beneficial for you to play out each possible scenario and conclusion (eg. your parents being supportive vs. your parents being disappointed and so on). How are you prepared to deal with the outcome?  You may also seek help through counselors, support groups and/or individuals you know that have dealt with similar situations to help you prepare to discuss this with your parents.  All the best!","It’s completely valid to feel uncomfortable and unsure about coming out, especially when the way your parents talk about bisexuality doesn’t feel supportive or accurate. It’s important to prioritize your emotional well-being and safety when deciding whether to come out. Here are some things to consider:

1. **Your Readiness**: Coming out is a personal decision, and you should only do it when you feel ready. There’s no rush, and it’s okay to take your time to process your feelings and decide what’s best for you.

2. **Their Attitudes**: It sounds like your parents may have misconceptions or biases about bisexuality, which can make it harder to come out to them. You might want to gauge their openness by bringing up the topic in a general way (e.g., talking about a bisexual character in a show or a news story) to see how they respond.

3. **Support System**: If you’re not ready to come out to your parents, lean on friends, online communities, or LGBTQ+ organizations for support. Having a safe space to express yourself can make a big difference.

4. **Educating Them**: If you do decide to come out, you might need to gently correct their misconceptions about bisexuality. For example, you could explain that bisexuality is about attraction to more than one gender, not about “doing anything.” However, this is not your responsibility if it feels too overwhelming.

5. **Setting Boundaries**: If their comments continue to make you uncomfortable, it’s okay to set boundaries. You can say something like, “I feel uncomfortable when people say things like that about bisexuality,” even if you’re not ready to come out.

6. **Safety**: If you’re unsure how they’ll react or worry about your safety or living situation, it might be best to wait until you’re in a more secure position to come out.

Remember, your identity is valid, and you deserve to be surrounded by people who respect and celebrate who you are. If coming out to your parents feels too risky right now, that’s okay—you can choose to share this part of yourself with them when the time feels right.",0.5183648467063904

I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that I’m not gay. I get the same results each time, and I feel disgust. This is tough on me. I'm scared that I looked too many times. I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.","Hello. Coming to terms with the idea that you might be of a sexuality other than the one in which you were socially raised to be, can be emotionally disturbing, and quite unsettling. It creates anxiety, maybe even panic, and leaves us feeling confused and uncertain about our own sense of identity. It becomes important to first ask yourself how you feel when you are thinking of being intimate with guys, or if you desire them to be intimate with you. It is important to know what impact this has on you, because it can determine your level of follow through and desire in pursuing sexual activity with someone of the same sex. I am not going to pass judgment on you either way - even for having the thoughts. I have worked with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) community in various ways over the years. Many I speak to, say they had to struggle to come to terms with this awareness about how they see themselves sexually. Maybe you are bisexual, and don't have an exclusive attraction to the same sex. You might consider doing some searches online for community support groups in your area, to explore the feelings and issues around this topic. Talking to someone who you trust can be helpful too. Running from your feelings is not a good idea, and others in a support group for sexuality issues, might be able to relate to you and what you're going through right now. This will offer you perspective, as you think on how this plays out in your life.Counselors are typically well trained to provide clinical services to clients who are experiencing feelings and thoughts much like the ones you are having now. I encourage you to consider reaching out for help. You are not crazy or insane for thinking of working with a counselor, nor of having feelings of same sex attraction. If you decide you are indeed gay, then know that you are not alone and never will be alone in that feeling. There is a huge community of support for you. Additionally, we all need help sometimes dealing with all sort of issues. A counselor can work more in depth with you to examine the motivations behind the feelings, and help you come to terms with them more directly. I hope that you come to a place where you feel less alone and more secure with yourself as you examine this area of your life. No matter what, do not fear being yourself. Again...you are not alone, I promise.Warm regards,Shawn Berthel, M.S., LMHC","I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way—it sounds like you’re going through a lot of emotional turmoil right now. First, I want to acknowledge how brave it is for you to share these thoughts and feelings. It’s okay to feel confused, scared, or upset when you’re questioning something as deeply personal as your identity or desires. Let’s break this down and try to approach it with compassion and clarity.

### 1. **It’s Okay to Question**
   - It’s completely normal to have moments of questioning or confusion about your sexuality, especially if you’ve never thought about this before. Sexuality can be fluid for some people, and it’s not always straightforward. What you’re feeling doesn’t have to define you or mean anything permanent.
   - You’re not alone in this. Many people go through periods of questioning, and it doesn’t make you abnormal or wrong.

### 2. **Be Kind to Yourself**
   - It’s clear that this is causing you a lot of distress, but try to treat yourself with the same kindness you’d offer a friend in this situation. Shame or self-judgment can make these feelings even harder to process.
   - It’s okay to feel disgust or discomfort when exploring something new or unfamiliar. That doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with you—it just means you’re trying to understand something that feels outside your current comfort zone.

### 3. **Sexuality Is Complex**
   - Sexuality isn’t always black and white. It’s possible to feel curious or confused without it meaning you’re gay, straight, or anything else. Sometimes, our minds fixate on things that feel new or different, especially when we’re under stress or feeling vulnerable.
   - Looking at gay porn or having thoughts about men doesn’t necessarily define your sexuality. It’s just one part of a much bigger picture.

### 4. **Fear and Obsession**
   - It sounds like you might be experiencing some obsessive thoughts or anxiety around this topic. When we’re scared or confused, our brains can latch onto certain ideas and make them feel bigger than they are.
   - If you’re shaking or feeling overwhelmed, it might help to focus on grounding techniques—like deep breathing, mindfulness, or talking to someone you trust—to calm your body and mind.

### 5. **You’re Not Defined by This**
   - This is just one moment in your life, and it doesn’t have to define who you are. You’re still the same person you were before this started. It’s okay to take time to process and explore your feelings without rushing to label yourself.
   - If you’re worried about looking at gay porn too many times, try to remind yourself that curiosity doesn’t equal identity. It’s okay to be curious, and it’s okay to decide it’s not for you.

### 6. **Consider Talking to Someone**
   - If these feelings are overwhelming or persistent, it might help to talk to a therapist or counselor who specializes in sexuality or mental health. They can provide a safe, nonjudgmental space to explore your thoughts and feelings.
   - Sometimes, just saying these things out loud to someone who listens can help you feel less alone and more in control.

### 7. **Give Yourself Time**
   - There’s no rush to figure everything out right now. It’s okay to sit with these feelings and let them unfold over time. You don’t have to have all the answers today.
   - Focus on taking care of yourself—physically, emotionally, and mentally. Do things that bring you comfort or joy, even if it’s just for a little while.

You’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to feel the way you do. Be patient with yourself, and remember that you’re worthy of love and understanding, no matter what you’re going through. If you ever need to talk more, I’m here to listen.",0.43898773193359375
2484,"I have known her for years. She was dating my brother-in-law when we met. My kids think of her as their aunt. On Halloween 2014, I lost my mom to cancer. My mom and dad were still married when she passed away. My friend was there for me through that and my own cancer diagnosis. She has been a very big part of both me and my kids’ life, but now last month, my dad told me that he really likes my friend and wants to marry her. She’s like a sister to me. My kids hate the idea.","How are you measuring whether or not your dad understands your wish?Your dad understanding your wish does not mean he will necessarily follow through with what you want.Based on what you describe about your relationship to the woman in question, your discomfort with the idea of your dad marrying your friend, is reasonable.Have the conversation with your dad that includes your viewpoint, and also ask him for his impression of your feelings.Its even possible he already has considered your feelings and hasn't yet told you.It is also possible that a conversation on the subject, as well as your dad following through with his decision to marry your best friend, may develop in a very positive way.Part of the current uneasiness you feel may be from fear of how a change in circumstances and introducing new relationship dynamics might feel.Given that the person who died was your mom, maybe your emotions are not yet ready seeing your dad with a replacement spouse. Try to see the situation from the point of everyone, including yourself, who is involved in this major change.  Maybe having a family discussion about acceptance and readiness to accept a new partner for your dad, would open new empathy for all of these family members.","This is an incredibly complex and emotionally charged situation, and it’s understandable that you and your kids are feeling conflicted. Your friend has been a significant part of your life for years, and the idea of her becoming your stepmother likely feels jarring and unsettling. Here are some thoughts and steps to consider as you navigate this:

### 1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**
   - It’s okay to feel confused, upset, or even betrayed. This situation has blurred the lines of your relationship with your friend and reshaped your family dynamics.
   - Your kids’ feelings are valid too. They see her as an aunt, and the idea of her becoming their step-grandmother might feel strange or uncomfortable.

### 2. **Talk to Your Dad**
   - Have an open and honest conversation with your dad about how you feel. Let him know how much your friend means to you and your kids, and explain the emotional complexity this situation brings.
   - Avoid being accusatory, but express your concerns and the impact this could have on your family dynamic.

### 3. **Talk to Your Friend**
   - Similarly, have a candid conversation with your friend. Share your feelings and ask her how she feels about the situation.
   - This conversation might help you understand her perspective and intentions, and it could also clarify whether she’s aware of the emotional impact on you and your kids.

### 4. **Consider Your Kids’ Perspective**
   - Your kids’ feelings are important, and they may need time to process this change. Reassure them that their relationship with your friend doesn’t have to change, even if the family dynamic shifts.
   - Encourage them to express their feelings openly and let them know their emotions are valid.

### 5. **Set Boundaries if Needed**
   - If the idea of your friend becoming your stepmother feels too uncomfortable, you may need to set boundaries with both your dad and your friend. This could involve discussing how you’ll navigate family gatherings or defining the roles in your relationships moving forward.

### 6. **Seek Support**
   - This situation is emotionally taxing, and it might help to talk to a therapist or counselor. They can provide guidance and help you process your feelings in a healthy way.
   - Lean on other trusted friends or family members for support.

### 7. **Give It Time**
   - Emotions are raw right now, and it may take time for everyone to adjust to this new reality. Be patient with yourself, your kids, your dad, and your friend as you all navigate this change.

Ultimately, this situation requires open communication, empathy, and understanding from everyone involved. While it’s a difficult shift, it’s possible to find a way forward that respects everyone’s feelings and preserves the important relationships in your life.",0.4950374364852905

   People keep telling me I have ""anxiety"" and I'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. This is all new to me. What can I do?","Hi, It is really good that you are working so hard to take care of your family. Anxiety can be so challenging, especially when new challenges have come up. It would be good to work through some of these issues you are experiencing, and examine your self care and support processes.","First, it’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed in this situation.

3387,"I'm in my late teens and live with my dad.  The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I won't want to talk to them for days or even weeks. 

Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.

Are they right, am I depressed?","Hello. Being a teenager in our society today can cause depression quite easily. We look at the world in which we live, and the doubts we have about being able to make a contribution, or to have value and worth with the people around us, and we begin to internalize those messages of self-worth. If that alone were not enough, you are trying to figure out where you want to go in life, and who you are supposed to be in the world. Teens are faced with pressures of being judged by your peers for how you present yourself; following current fashions; possessing the trendy things; and hanging out with the ""in crowd."" Here's a ""secret"" that might help with most of those issues: Not much of those problems I've just described will really matter as they might seem to right now, in the real world. If you are feeling depression because you feel you lack some of those things that are seen as important by others (like your peers), I can assure you that being someone who is kind; compassionate; understanding of another person's suffering; and the effort you make to be the best person you can become in the world, will far outweigh anything you experienced in your teen years.When we are young, we judge everything based on what our peers have, what they say, the way they dress, who's popular, who's not popular, and for the most of it, all of that is external. So the question becomes, are you trying to fix the feelings on the inside (the internal stuff), with the trappings of all the stuff on the outside (the internal)? That is to say, do you feel that if you had what your friends have, you would be happy and less depressed? Depression is usually a symptom of something much bigger, it is not typically a problem by itself (just as a person who experiences a high temperature may likely have a cold). So fixing the symptom requires looking at the possible causes. In your post, you mentioned that you live with your dad. Are your parents divorced or separated, or has your mom passed away? Either of these circumstances could certainly cause depression. Finding out when you started feeling depressed, might be able to pinpoint the trigger that caused it, which requires looking at when you last felt really happy. It is also important to keep in mind, that as a teenager, your emotions are often being experienced very randomly, and sometimes without cause. It is part of your emotional development, but as you grow older can learn how to manage those emotions better and practice doing things that help you feel better (without causing harm to yourself).Have you tried talking to your dad about your feelings, or maybe another relative if you feel safer doing so? Do you have a friend who is your best friend...someone who is there for you no matter what? If not, there is a service you can use that is a national number for teens to talk with teen peer counselors. They are teens like yourself, but they have some insights that might be helpful. Its called Teen Line (https://teenlineonline.org/). It helped me when I was in my teens, and has helped lots of other teens as well. You might find a place to get some referrals to other local services in your area. If you want are in Washington state and would like to connect with me directly, you call link to me via my profile page. Or perhaps finding a counselor in your local area might be useful. Most towns and cities have some form of low cost counseling. You might also check with your school for assistance.Don't be afraid of not always knowing how you are supposed to feel. Adults don't always have a handle on it either. Being a teenager carries a lot stress, fear, and uncertainty. But you are not alone, and there is help if you reach out for it. I wish for you the very best, and bright future. ","It’s important to approach your feelings with care and self-compassion. While I’m not a mental health professional, what you’re describing—fluctuating social energy, feelings of self-doubt, and isolation—can sometimes be signs of depression, but they can also be related to other factors like stress, anxiety, or simply your personality and preferences. Here are some things to consider:

### 1. **Social Energy and Introversion**
   - It’s completely normal to have periods where you feel more social and other times when you need space. This could be a sign of introversion or simply needing time to recharge.
   - However, if avoiding social interactions is causing you distress or isolation, it might be worth exploring why you feel this way.

### 2. **Feelings of Self-Worth**
   - Thoughts like “I’m not worth knowing” or “I’ll never do anything right” can be signs of low self-esteem or negative self-talk. These feelings can sometimes be linked to depression, but they can also stem from stress, perfectionism, or past experiences.

### 3. **Depression Symptoms**
   Depression often involves persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or emptiness, along with changes in sleep, appetite, energy, and interest in activities. If you’re experiencing several of these symptoms for more than two weeks, it could be worth talking to a counselor or therapist.

### 4. **Stress and Life Transitions**
   Being in your late teens and navigating college can be a stressful time. It’s common to feel overwhelmed or unsure of yourself during this phase of life. These feelings don’t necessarily mean you’re depressed, but they can still be challenging to manage.

### What You Can Do:
   - **Reflect on Your Feelings:** Journaling or talking to someone you trust can help you understand your emotions better.
   - **Reach Out for Support:** Consider talking to a counselor or therapist. They can help you explore your feelings and determine if depression or anxiety might be playing a role.
   - **Practice Self-Compassion:** Remind yourself that it’s okay to have ups and downs. You don’t have to be perfect, and your worth isn’t defined by your productivity or social life.
   - **Set Small Goals:** If you’re feeling stuck, try setting small, achievable goals for yourself. This can help build confidence and a sense of accomplishment.

### When to Seek Help:
If your feelings are overwhelming, persistent, or interfering with your daily life, it’s a good idea to reach out to a mental health professional. Depression is treatable, and seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.

How do I overcome this anxierty and depression?,Anxiety and depression are often linked. I don't consider them as diseases. Depression is a symptom of deep hurts to the sense of self that leaves a person feeling shamed. Anxiety is a symptom of not being given the proper emotional resources to handle the problems of life.

### 4. **Establish a Routine**
   - Depression and anxiety can make it hard to stay organized, but having a daily routine can provide structure and a sense of stability. Start small—wake up, eat, and sleep at consistent times.

### 5. **Practice Mindfulness and Relaxation**
   - **Mindfulness:** Techniques like meditation or deep breathing can help you stay grounded in the present moment and reduce anxiety.

### 11. **Engage in Activities You Enjoy**
   - Even if you don’t feel like it, try to engage in activities that once brought you joy or a sense of accomplishment. This can help break the cycle of negative emotions.

### 12. **Practice Gratitude**
   - Write down three things you’re grateful for each day. Focusing on positive aspects of your life can help shift your perspective.

### 13. **Limit Social Media and News**

3117,"My husband and I have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. Others have told me that most men would have left me by now. Honestly, I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing. I want to be better connected with my husband.","It's encouraging that you say you want ""to be better connected with [your] husband,"" and since he hasn't left you, he must care about you and the relationship more than he does about just having sex. You don't say whether he complains or not, but even if he doesn't it seems there's a sense of something important missing for both of you.Most likely to connect better with him physically you'll need to become better connected with yourself and your body. Men often feel fulfilled by sex simply because it happened - the woman they want received them, allowed them to make love with her. For women that can sometimes be more complicated. A woman who loves sex most likely also loves her body, knows what pleasures her, and feels confident asking for what she wants. Self-pleasuring can be a way for you to discover more about your sexuality, and a classic resource is Betty Dodson's book Sex for One: The Joy of Selfloving. A good counselor or sex therapist can be very helpful with your whole relationship as well as the sexual part of it, but not all counselors are comfortable working with sexual issues. Shop around and be sure you find someone who can help you and your husband get better connected on all levels.","It’s wonderful that you’re reflecting on your relationship and seeking ways to strengthen your connection with your husband.

### 2. **Explore Your Sex Drive**
   - **Understand Your Body:** If you feel you have a low sex drive, consider exploring the reasons behind it. Hormonal imbalances, stress, medications, or underlying health issues can all affect libido. Consulting a healthcare professional or therapist can provide insights and solutions.
   - **Explore Together:** If you’re unsure about what you enjoy sexually, take time to explore this together with your husband. This could involve reading books, watching educational videos, or simply experimenting in a safe and supportive way.

### 3. **Focus on Emotional Intimacy**
   - **Strengthen Your Bond:** Physical intimacy often stems from emotional closeness. Spend quality time together, engage in activities you both enjoy, and express affection through words, gestures, and touch.

### 6. **Be Patient and Kind to Yourselves**
   - **Avoid Comparison:** Every relationship is unique, and comparing yours to others can create unnecessary stress. Focus on what works for you and your husband.

When I start to make it happen I get irritated by other people if they intervene. Then if the thing I wanted to do doesn't work out, I have these tendencies to blame other people for it not working out.    Can you explain what's going on?","Mood swings and getting frustrated when things don't work out is totally normal. Sometimes, we get tied to one thing we really want to do and it can feel pretty intense when that gets interrupted or doesn't work out. This said, you're coming to CounselChat and so I'm guessing this is something that is pretty intense for you and something that you are concerned about. If this is getting in the way of your life, it may be worthwhile to reach out to a therapist or doctor to get some help with this and see if there might be something more going on. While for most people frustration/mood swings is related to typical life and stress, if very intense it can be a sign of a number of challenges ranging from anxiety to a traumatic experience to something like Bipolar Disorder where a person's mood and energy might fly so high (mania) that one feels like they can do anything but often become frustrated when interrupted (note: there is a lot more to Bipolar Disorder than this and this is certainly not a diagnosis). Wish you well!","What you're describing sounds like emotional intensity and mood swings, which are very common during the teenage years. This is a time of significant physical, emotional, and social changes, and your brain is still developing, particularly the parts that regulate emotions and decision-making. Here’s a breakdown of what might be happening:

### 1. **Intense Mood Swings**
   - **Hormonal Changes**: During adolescence, your body is going through hormonal fluctuations, which can amplify emotions and make them feel more intense.
   - **Brain Development**: The prefrontal cortex (the part of the brain responsible for impulse control, decision-making, and regulating emotions) is still maturing. This can make it harder to manage strong feelings or reactions.

### 2. **Irritation When Others Intervene**
   - **Desire for Independence**: As a teenager, you’re likely seeking more autonomy and control over your life. When others interfere with your plans or ideas, it can feel frustrating because it challenges your sense of independence.
   - **Emotional Sensitivity**: Heightened emotions can make you more reactive to perceived criticism or interference, even if it’s not intended that way.

### 3. **Blaming Others When Things Don’t Work Out**
   - **Externalizing Emotions**: When you’re upset or disappointed, it’s sometimes easier to direct those feelings outward (blaming others) rather than inward (reflecting on your own role). This is a common coping mechanism, especially when emotions feel overwhelming.
   - **Lack of Perspective-Taking**: The teenage brain is still developing the ability to see situations from multiple perspectives. This can make it harder to recognize that others may not be at fault.

### 4. **What Can You Do?**
   - **Self-Awareness**: Start by noticing your patterns. When you feel irritated or blame others, pause and ask yourself, “What’s really upsetting me?” This can help you identify the root of your emotions.
   - **Communication**: If others are interfering with your plans, try expressing your feelings calmly and assertively. For example, “I’m really excited about this idea, and I’d appreciate it if you let me try it my way.”
   - **Problem-Solving**: When things don’t work out, focus on what you can learn from the situation rather than assigning blame. Ask yourself, “What could I do differently next time?”
   - **Mindfulness and Relaxation**: Practices like deep breathing, journaling, or mindfulness can help you manage intense emotions and reduce reactivity.
   - **Seek Support**: If these mood swings feel overwhelming or are affecting your relationships or daily life, consider talking to a trusted adult, counselor, or therapist. They can help you develop strategies to cope.

### 5. **Remember, This Is Normal**
   - What you’re experiencing is a normal part of growing up. It’s a time of learning how to navigate complex emotions and relationships. Be patient with yourself as you develop these skills.

If these mood swings feel extreme or are causing significant distress, it might be worth exploring whether there’s an underlying issue, such as anxiety, depression, or another mental health concern. A mental health professional can provide guidance and support tailored to your needs.",0.4959617853164673
17,"I'm going through some things with my feelings and myself. I barely sleep and I do nothing but think about how I'm worthless and how I shouldn't be here.
   I've never tried or contemplated suicide. I've always wanted to fix my issues, but I never get around to it.
   How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?","You can, for sure... and the first step is to believe you are worthy TO YOURSELF. Recognizing you are in a quest is already a big first step. Taking the time to start figuring out who you are is definitely the next... do so with SELF COMPASSION and kindness. Know this is a process and just look forward for what you might find.  I do recommend you find someone to talk to (there are many options out there that can fit the situation you are in), and I also recommend you start by giving yourself the importance to invest some time and effort in this quest. YOU DESERVE IT. There are some excellent TED Talks you can google, great books you can read, or even joining a yoga practice, team or some kind of hobby may help. Anything that shows yourself you are worthy of this effort. Have patience and start!!!! the answer is out there waiting for you. Asking these questions already set you on the right path.","First, I want to acknowledge how brave it is for you to share these feelings. It’s clear that you’re going through a challenging time, and it’s important to recognize that your feelings are valid, even if they’re painful. The fact that you’re reaching out for help and wanting to change is a powerful step forward. Here are some suggestions to help you shift your mindset and begin to feel more valued and connected:

---

### 1. **Challenge Negative Self-Talk**
   - Your thoughts about being “worthless” are likely distorted by your current emotional state. Try to identify these thoughts and question them. Ask yourself:
     - “Is this thought true? What evidence do I have for or against it?”
     - “Would I say this to someone I care about? If not, why am I saying it to myself?”
   - Replace harsh self-criticism with more compassionate and realistic thoughts. For example, instead of “I’m worthless,” try “I’m struggling right now, but that doesn’t define my worth.”

---

### 2. **Focus on Small, Achievable Goals**
   - Feeling stuck can amplify feelings of worthlessness. Start with small, manageable steps to build momentum. For example:
     - Set a goal to go for a short walk, clean one corner of your room, or reach out to a friend.
     - Celebrate even the smallest victories—they matter and show that you’re capable of taking action.

---

### 3. **Reconnect with Your Values**
   - Reflect on what truly matters to you. What are your core values? (e.g., kindness, creativity, connection, growth). Aligning your actions with these values can help you feel more purposeful and grounded.
   - Ask yourself: “What’s one small thing I can do today that aligns with what I care about?”

---

### 4. **Practice Self-Compassion**
   - Treat yourself with the same kindness you’d offer a friend. Remind yourself that everyone struggles, and it’s okay to not be okay.
   - Try self-compassion exercises, such as writing a letter to yourself from the perspective of someone who loves and supports you.

---

### 5. **Reach Out for Support**
   - Isolation can intensify feelings of worthlessness. Share your feelings with someone you trust—a friend, family member, or therapist. You don’t have to go through this alone.
   - If therapy isn’t accessible right now, consider joining a support group or online community where you can connect with others who understand what you’re going through.

---

### 6. **Practice Gratitude**
   - Gratitude can help shift your focus from what’s wrong to what’s still good in your life. Each day, write down three things you’re grateful for, no matter how small.
   - This practice can help you recognize that you still have value and that there are positive aspects of your life.

---

### 7. **Take Care of Your Physical Health**
   - Lack of sleep and poor self-care can worsen feelings of worthlessness. Try to establish a routine that includes:
     - Regular sleep patterns (even if it’s just a little at a time).
     - Nutritious meals and hydration.
     - Gentle movement, like stretching or walking, to boost your mood.

---

### 8. **Remember That Worth Isn’t Earned**
   - Your worth isn’t tied to what you achieve, how much you do, or how others perceive you. You are inherently valuable simply because you exist. This can be hard to internalize, but it’s a truth worth repeating to yourself.

---

### 9. **Seek Professional Help**
   - If these feelings persist or feel overwhelming, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor. They can help you explore the root causes of these feelings and develop strategies to work through them.

---

### 10. **Be Patient with Yourself**
   - Healing and change take time. It’s okay to have bad days and setbacks. What matters is that you’re taking steps, no matter how small, toward feeling better.

---

You are not worthless. The fact that you’re here, asking for help, and wanting to improve shows incredible strength and resilience.

2541,"I think I'm annoying and bothersome, but my girlfriend says I'm just fine. I don't think so, I think I'm stressing everyone else out","I'm glad to hear you have friends and that your friends say they like you.Trust your own sense of who you are which tells you that something feels uneasy within yourself.Is the friend who says you're ""just fine"", very familiar with who you are?""Friend"" is a broad category.She may not know you as fully as you know yourself.Basically, it is possible to be ""fine"" and have some inner stress.Follow your own thoughts and observations to more fully learn about yourself in ways your friend may not notice or be aware.","It's really tough to feel like you're burdening others, and I’m sorry you’re feeling this way. It’s important to recognize that your feelings are valid, but they might not necessarily reflect how others truly see you. Here are a few things to consider:

1. **Self-Perception vs. Reality**: Sometimes, we’re our own harshest critics. You might be focusing on what you perceive as flaws or mistakes, while others (like your girlfriend) see the bigger picture and appreciate you for who you are. If your girlfriend says you’re fine, it’s worth trusting her perspective—she knows you well and cares about you.

2. **Open Communication**: If you’re worried about stressing others out, it might help to talk to them about it. For example, you could ask your girlfriend or friends, “Do I ever come across as annoying or overwhelming?” Their responses might surprise you and help ease your concerns.

3. **Anxiety and Overthinking**: Feelings of being bothersome or stressful to others can sometimes stem from anxiety or overthinking. If this is something that happens often, it might be helpful to explore these feelings with a therapist or counselor who can help you work through them.

4. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. Everyone has moments where they feel like they’re not measuring up, but that doesn’t mean you’re actually a burden. Try to focus on the positive things you bring to your relationships and remind yourself that you’re deserving of love and support.

5. **Actions Speak Louder Than Words**: If you’re worried about being stressful to others, focus on small, positive actions—like checking in on them, showing appreciation, or being a good listener. These actions can reinforce your relationships and help you feel more confident in your role.

Remember, it’s okay to have doubts, but don’t let them overshadow the love and support others are offering you. You’re not alone in feeling this way, and it’s a sign of your care and empathy that you’re even thinking about how you affect others. Take it one step at a time, and be gentle with yourself.",0.5077214241027832
1556,"I was never single, afraid to be alone, and I looked for my boyfriend to make me happy. I finally worked on my self, was in a relationship, and I did everything a healthy girlfriend does and it didn't work out. Now months later, no man peaks my interest. Am I ready to date again? Is there a reason no one sparks my interest?","Yes, of course there's a reason!There's always a reason for most dynamics!Depending on the nature and qualities of what changed as a result of your new self realizations, you may be more deeply affected by your new awareness than how you imagined these would go.Since you already are on the best road possible for yourself, since this resulted from your own introspection, keep trusting your own self work as to what develops and at what pace your relationship attraction qualities grow.","It sounds like you've been on a significant journey of self-discovery and growth, which is something to be proud of. Let’s break this down to better understand where you are and how you might approach dating again.

### 1. **Are You Ready to Date Again?**
   - **Emotional Readiness:** If you’ve taken time to heal, reflect, and focus on yourself after your last relationship, you may be emotionally ready. However, readiness isn’t just about time—it’s about feeling secure and content with yourself, regardless of whether or not you’re in a relationship.
   - **Self-Sufficiency:** It’s a positive sign that you’ve worked on yourself and no longer rely on a partner for happiness. This independence is key to healthy relationships.
   - **Desire to Connect:** If you feel open to meeting new people and forming connections, even if it’s just casual, it could indicate readiness. If the idea of dating feels draining or unappealing, you might need more time.

### 2. **Why No One Sparks Your Interest?**
   - **Higher Standards:** After working on yourself, your standards and self-awareness may have increased. You’re no longer settling for less than you deserve, which is a good thing.
   - **Healing Process:** It’s possible you’re still healing from your past relationship. Sometimes, the emotional energy required to connect with someone new isn’t fully available yet.
   - **Focus on Self:** If you’re deeply invested in your own growth and goals, it’s natural that potential partners might not immediately capture your attention. You’re prioritizing yourself, and that’s okay.
   - **Timing:** Sometimes, the right people just haven’t crossed your path yet. Chemistry and connection can’t be forced, and it’s normal to go through periods where no one stands out.

### 3. **What Can You Do?**
   - **Be Patient:** Healing and finding the right person take time. There’s no rush—focus on enjoying your life as it is now.
   - **Stay Open:** You don’t have to actively pursue dating, but staying open to possibilities can help. Sometimes, interest sparks when you least expect it.
   - **Reflect on What You Want:** Take time to clarify what you’re looking for in a partner and a relationship. This can help you recognize potential matches when they appear.
   - **Enjoy the Process:** Dating doesn’t have to be serious right away. It can be about meeting new people, having fun, and learning more about yourself.

### Final Thoughts:
It’s okay if no one sparks your interest right now. This could be a sign that you’re valuing yourself and your time more than ever. When you’re truly ready and the right person comes along, you’ll likely feel a natural connection. Until then, trust the process and continue focusing on your own happiness and growth.",0.49598228931427
599,"When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. She is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but I am afraid she is stressing too much. I’m afraid it’s going to break her. I don't know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal.","It may be helpful to register for a class you can take together. I would recommend mindful meditation or yoga, just the two of you. Something you find time for in a weekly basis. Yoga is amazing in learning mindfulness and reducing stress. I use yoga and mindful techniques when working with children and recommend it to parents to engage with their children. Hope this helps.","It’s completely understandable to feel concerned when your daughter is experiencing such intense stress, especially over seemingly small things. While it’s great that she’s academically successful, it’s important to address her emotional well-being as well. Here are some steps you can take to support her:

---

### 1. **Validate Her Feelings**
   - Let her know it’s okay to feel stressed or upset, even if the issue seems minor to others. Avoid dismissing her concerns as ""silly.""
   - Phrases like, ""I can see this is really upsetting you,"" or ""It’s okay to feel this way"" can help her feel heard and understood.

---

### 2. **Teach Coping Strategies**
   - Help her develop tools to manage stress, such as:
     - Deep breathing exercises (e.g., inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4).
     - Mindfulness or meditation techniques.
     - Journaling to express her feelings.
     - Physical activities like walking, dancing, or yoga to release tension.

---

### 3. **Encourage a Balanced Lifestyle**
   - Ensure she’s getting enough sleep, eating well, and taking breaks from schoolwork.
   - Help her prioritize time for hobbies, relaxation, and socializing with friends.

---

### 4. **Model Healthy Stress Management**
   - Show her how you handle stress in a positive way. Kids often learn by observing their parents.

---

### 5. **Talk to Her About Perfectionism**
   - If her stress is tied to maintaining her 4.0, gently discuss the idea that it’s okay to not be perfect. Reinforce that mistakes and challenges are part of learning and growing.

---

### 6. **Seek Professional Support if Needed**
   - If her stress is persistent, overwhelming, or interfering with her daily life, it may be helpful to consult a mental health professional, such as a child psychologist or counselor. They can assess whether she’s experiencing anxiety or another issue and provide tailored strategies.
   - A doctor can also rule out any underlying physical health concerns that might be contributing to her stress.

---

### 7. **Communicate with Her School**
   - If her stress is school-related, consider talking to her teachers or school counselor. They may be able to provide additional support or accommodations.

---

### Is This Normal?
While some stress is a normal part of life, frequent crying, ""freaking out,"" or intense emotional reactions could indicate that she’s struggling to cope. It’s not necessarily a cause for alarm, but it’s worth addressing proactively to prevent it from escalating.

---

### When to Seek Help
Consider reaching out to a professional if:
   - Her stress is affecting her sleep, appetite, or ability to function.
   - She’s withdrawing from activities or people she used to enjoy.
   - She expresses feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness.
   - Her stress seems disproportionate to the situation and persists over time.

2699,"I'm fine when we start becoming intimate, but out of nowhere, I will get a flashback of what happened to me in the past. I start hysterically crying and freaking out when my boyfriend obviously has done nothing to hurt me.","Have you sought the support of a therapist really qualified in working through sexual trauma? It can take some work, but healing is possible. If you feel able to, it may also help to open a dialogue with your boyfriend about what you need from him when you have these flashbacks. Let him know what some helpful responses may be. ","I'm really sorry you're going through this. What you're describing sounds like it could be related to past trauma, and your body and mind might be reacting to triggers that remind you of what happened, even if the situation in the present is safe and consensual. This is a common response for people who have experienced trauma, and it’s important to approach it with care and compassion for yourself.

Here are some steps you might consider:

### 1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**
   - It’s okay to feel this way. Your reaction is valid, and it’s not your fault. Trauma can resurface unexpectedly, and it’s important to be gentle with yourself.

### 2. **Communicate with Your Boyfriend**
   - If you feel comfortable, let your boyfriend know what’s happening. Reassure him that it’s not about him, and explain that you’re dealing with something from your past. Open communication can help him understand and support you better.

### 3. **Set Boundaries**
   - It’s okay to take a step back from intimacy until you feel more comfortable. You can let your boyfriend know that you need to go at your own pace and that you might need breaks or pauses.

### 4. **Practice Grounding Techniques**
   - When you feel a flashback coming on, grounding techniques can help bring you back to the present. For example:
     - Focus on your breathing: Take slow, deep breaths.
     - Name five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.
     - Hold onto something comforting, like a blanket or a piece of jewelry.

### 5. **Seek Professional Help**
   - A therapist, especially one who specializes in trauma, can help you process what happened and develop coping strategies. Therapy can be a safe space to explore your feelings and work through the trauma.

### 6. **Consider Trauma-Informed Practices**
   - Practices like EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), somatic therapy, or mindfulness techniques can be helpful in addressing trauma and its effects.

### 7. **Take Care of Yourself**
   - Self-care is crucial. Engage in activities that make you feel safe and calm, whether it’s spending time with loved ones, journaling, or doing something creative.

### 8. **Be Patient with Yourself**
   - Healing from trauma takes time, and it’s not a linear process. It’s okay to have setbacks, and it’s okay to take things one step at a time.

You’re not alone in this, and there is support available. Reaching out for help is a brave and important step toward healing.",0.555226743221283
495,"I've hit my head on walls and floors ever since I was young. I sometimes still do it but I don't exactly know why,    I have anxiety and I had a rough childhood but now I'll start to hit my head and sometimes not realize it but I don't know how to stop or even why I'm doing it.    How can I help myself to change my behavior?","The best way to handle anxiety of this level is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor, and therapy to help you understand the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are causing the anxiety. This is not something that anyone should just “white knuckle” and try to get through on their own with no help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety. This takes a therapist trained in CBT. You will learn to recognize when and why you perform the behavior of hitting your head, help you deal with the underlying cause of this, and replace the behavior with a more positive behavior. You'll learn coping skills.You mention having a rough childhood. Anyone who has experienced trauma like this, especially long-term ongoing trauma from abuse of any kind, definitely does not need ""exposure therapy"", which is what is recommended for phobias. You need a therapist trained specifically in trauma informed therapy.You are on the right path by recognizing there is an issue and what it is. Good luck with your healing journey!","I’m sorry you’re dealing with this—it sounds like a challenging situation, and it’s great that you’re reaching out for help. Head-hitting can be a way of coping with overwhelming emotions, stress, or anxiety, especially if it’s been a long-standing behavior. It might also be a form of self-soothing or a way to release tension, even if it’s not fully conscious. Here are some steps you can take to understand and address this behavior:

---

### 1. **Understand the Triggers**
   - Pay attention to when and why you feel the urge to hit your head. Is it during moments of anxiety, frustration, or sadness? Journaling or tracking these moments can help you identify patterns.
   - Consider whether certain environments, thoughts, or emotions trigger the behavior.

---

### 2. **Replace the Behavior**
   - Find safer, healthier ways to release tension or self-soothe. For example:
     - **Physical alternatives:** Squeeze a stress ball, tap your legs, or clench and release your fists.
     - **Sensory input:** Use a weighted blanket, fidget toys, or chew gum.
     - **Movement:** Engage in physical activity like walking, stretching, or dancing.
   - Practice grounding techniques, such as deep breathing or focusing on your senses, to calm yourself in the moment.

---

### 3. **Address Underlying Emotions**
   - If this behavior is linked to anxiety or unresolved trauma, consider seeking therapy. A therapist can help you explore the root causes and develop healthier coping strategies.
   - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) can be particularly helpful for managing self-harm behaviors and emotional regulation.

---

### 4. **Practice Self-Compassion**
   - Be kind to yourself. This behavior likely developed as a way to cope during difficult times, and it’s not something to feel ashamed of.
   - Remind yourself that change takes time, and it’s okay to seek support.

---

### 5. **Create a Support System**
   - Talk to someone you trust about what you’re going through, whether it’s a friend, family member, or therapist.
   - If you feel comfortable, let them know how they can support you when you’re struggling.

---

### 6. **Consider Professional Help**
   - If the behavior feels out of your control or is causing harm, reach out to a mental health professional. They can help you develop a personalized plan to address it.
   - If you’re not already in therapy, consider starting with a counselor who specializes in anxiety, trauma, or self-harm behaviors.

---

### 7. **Practice Mindfulness**
   - Mindfulness can help you become more aware of your urges and emotions in the moment. When you feel the urge to hit your head, pause and observe what’s happening in your body and mind without judgment.
   - Apps like Calm or Headspace can help you build mindfulness skills.

---

### 8. **Set Small Goals**
   - Start by reducing the frequency or intensity of the behavior. For example, if you notice you’re about to hit your head, try to redirect the movement or stop yourself mid-action.
   - Celebrate small victories—every step toward change is progress.

---

### 9. **Take Care of Your Physical Health**
   - Ensure you’re getting enough sleep, eating regularly, and staying hydrated. Physical well-being can impact emotional regulation.

---

### 10. **Be Patient with Yourself**
   - Changing a long-standing behavior takes time and effort. It’s okay to have setbacks—what matters is that you’re working toward understanding and improving.

1091,"My husband and I had our first threesome recently. Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me.    He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better, and now I'm craving more of it. But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling. Why am I feeling this way?","You need to have an honest conversation with each other about WHY you both want a threesome. Evaluate the status of your relationship with each other. Are you having issues? Fighting? Not feeling satisfied with each other? How has your sex life been with each other?  If there are any problems, insecurities, issues, introducing something like this may only make your relationship worse. Open relationships and threesomes rarely work out well. Sure, there are some who successfully live this lifestyle, but it only works when both people are completely secure in their relationship with each other, harbor no jealousies or insecurities, and aren't looking to someone else to satisfy needs that aren't getting met by their spouse. Let me say that again: This is not likely to work out well for you if either of you are insecure, jealous, or looking to have needs met by this other person that you aren't getting from your spouse. That empty feeling you're having - listen to it. Dig deep to find out where it is coming from. What thoughts are going through your head when you feel that way? You'll get the answer.The other thing that helps make something like this work is for both of you to listen and respect each other. If you don't like it that he paid more attention to the other girl, he needs to know that, and he needs to respect that.  If you're going to do it again, he needs to know what you're comfortable with and what you want. Set the limits before you're in the moment, before it's too late to take an action back. Turn it around and ask him what he would be comfortable with if it were a man instead of a woman.It is perfectly natural to be curious and want to experiment. A lot of people get that out of the way before settling down in a monogamous relationship. People who marry young and/or inexperienced may still feel that curiosity about things like that and want to experience them, but don't want to hurt their spouse. The REASON you are both doing this matters a lot. If there are problems in your relationship, this is likely to only make things worse.","It’s completely normal to have mixed or complex emotions after a threesome, especially if it was your first experience. The feelings you’re describing—craving more but also feeling empty or uneasy—could stem from a variety of factors:

1. **Emotional Processing**: Threesomes can bring up a lot of emotions, including excitement, insecurity, jealousy, or even guilt. The ""empty feeling"" might be your mind processing these emotions, especially if you’re still reconciling your feelings about the experience.

2. **Fear of Comparison**: If your husband was more focused on the other person during the threesome, it might have triggered feelings of insecurity or fear of being compared. Even if you’ve talked about it and feel better, those emotions might resurface as you consider doing it again.

3. **Uncertainty About Boundaries**: Threesomes require clear communication and boundaries. The empty feeling could be a sign that you’re unsure about your own limits or whether this is something you truly want to pursue further.

4. **Desire vs. Reality**: You might crave the excitement or novelty of the experience but feel emotionally disconnected or uncertain about how it aligns with your relationship or personal values.

5. **Post-Experience Letdown**: After an intense or new experience, it’s common to feel a sense of emptiness or anticlimax as the adrenaline and excitement wear off.

6. **Relationship Dynamics**: Threesomes can shift the dynamics of a relationship, even temporarily. The empty feeling might be related to concerns about how this could affect your connection with your husband.

To address these feelings, consider the following steps:
- **Reflect on Your Emotions**: Journaling or talking with a trusted friend or therapist can help you unpack your feelings and identify what’s causing the emptiness.
- **Communicate with Your Husband**: Share your mixed emotions with him openly. Discuss what you both enjoyed, what felt uncomfortable, and how you can ensure everyone feels valued and secure in future experiences.
- **Set Clear Boundaries**: If you decide to explore this further, establish clear boundaries and agreements to ensure everyone feels safe and respected.
- **Take Your Time**: There’s no rush to repeat the experience. Give yourself space to process and decide what feels right for you.

Remember, it’s okay to have conflicting emotions. What matters most is that you and your husband continue to communicate openly and prioritize each other’s emotional well-being.",0.42760252952575684

I think it is great that you are self-aware and want to work on this.Feeling ""unhappy and trapped"" may also mean that you are  believing these negative thoughts are absolutely true. We have lots and lots of thoughts throughout the day. Sometimes we pay a lot of attention to some and some we ignore. Right now these thoughts are getting a lot of your attention and perhaps you are thinking because you are thinking them they are true.  Is it really true that you trapped? You also said that you have an amazing life. It doesn't sound like you are only having negative thoughts. You have some positive ones, too. However, you are giving a lot of weight to the negative thoughts, more weight than the positive ones.I also wonder if you are struggling with the fact that you are even having this thought. One thing that can be helpful is to recognize that you are having a thought, that it is a negative thought, that thinking it does not make it true, and to let it go. This is the basis for mindfulness work that can be really helpful. It is a great place for you to start so you can balance out your thoughts and emotions.Best of luck to you!","First, I want to acknowledge how brave it is for you to share these feelings. What you're experiencing is incredibly common, especially for parents and spouses who pour so much of themselves into their families. It’s okay to feel this way, and it doesn’t mean you don’t love your family or that you’re ungrateful for your life. It simply means you’re human, and you’re yearning for a sense of self beyond the roles you play.

Here are some thoughts and suggestions that might help you navigate this:

---

### 1. **Your Feelings Are Valid**
   - It’s normal to feel a sense of loss or confusion about your identity when your life revolves around caring for others. You’re not alone in this, and it doesn’t mean you’re a bad mom or wife. It just means you’re craving balance and a deeper connection with yourself.

---

### 2. **Reconnect with Your Interests**
   - Think about the things you loved before becoming a mom and wife. Were there hobbies, passions, or dreams you set aside? Even if it’s just a small step, try to reintroduce something that brings *you* joy—whether it’s reading, painting, exercising, or learning something new.
   - If you’re not sure what you enjoy anymore, give yourself permission to explore. Try new activities and see what resonates.

---

### 3. **Carve Out Time for Yourself**
   - It’s easy to feel trapped when your time is entirely dedicated to others. Talk to your husband about creating a routine where you have regular “me time.” Even an hour a week to focus on yourself can make a big difference.
   - If childcare is a barrier, consider asking for help from family or friends, or explore local resources like babysitting co-ops.

---

### 4. **Reframe Your Thoughts**
   - It’s natural to think about what you’ve “given up,” but try to shift your focus to what you’ve gained and what you can still create. Your identity is not fixed—it’s evolving. You can still pursue your dreams and passions, even if it looks different now.
   - Instead of thinking, “I’ve lost myself,” try thinking, “I’m rediscovering who I am in this new chapter.”

---

### 5. **Talk to Someone**
   - If these feelings persist, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you process your emotions and develop strategies to rebuild your sense of self.
   - You might also find support in mom groups or online communities where others share similar experiences.

---

### 6. **Practice Self-Compassion**
   - It’s easy to feel guilty for not being “happy enough,” but beating yourself up only makes things harder. Remind yourself that it’s okay to feel conflicted and that you’re doing your best.
   - Try journaling or affirmations to shift your mindset. For example, “I am more than my roles, and I deserve to feel fulfilled.”

---

### 7. **Involve Your Family in Your Growth**
   - Share your feelings with your husband in a way that helps him understand your needs. Let him know that taking time for yourself will ultimately make you a happier and more present partner and mom.
   - You can also involve your kids in activities that align with your interests, like crafting, cooking, or outdoor adventures. This way, you’re nurturing your identity while spending time with them.

---

### 8. **Set Small Goals**
   - Rediscovering yourself doesn’t have to happen overnight. Start with small, achievable goals, like signing up for a class, joining a book club, or setting aside 15 minutes a day for something you enjoy.

---

### 9. **Remember: You’re Not Alone**
   - Many moms and wives feel this way, even if they don’t talk about it openly. You’re not failing—you’re navigating a challenging but common part of life.

---

### 10. **Be Patient with Yourself**
   - Rediscovering your identity is a journey, and it’s okay if it takes time. Celebrate small wins along the way and remind yourself that you’re worthy of happiness and fulfillment.

---

You’re doing an incredible job balancing so many responsibilities, but you deserve to feel like *you* again. Take it one step at a time, and know that it’s never too late to reconnect with yourself and create a life that feels fulfilling in every way. You’ve got this. 💛",0.42380982637405396
211,I am going through a very hard time and I'm so depressed. My parents are getting a divorce and a lot of bad things are happening. I want to lull myself.,"It sounds like a tough time and it's normal to feel down when your family is going through a divorce or other hardship. There's a difference between feelings like sadness, discouragement, grief, loneliness and depression, though. Sadness is sadness and sometimes we have to go through a grieving or other process, that is a normal reaction to events in our lives. Depression, on the other hand, is more about being stuck. Lulling yourself with self-care sounds like a healthy response and a way to give yourself support. So as to the uncomfortable but healthy part of your feelings, do the best you can to put names to it and share with a trusted other person. You will find comfort. The part of your situation that's depression -- feeling stuck, not able to get out of bad, concentrate, changes in sleeping and eating, loss of enjoyment in living, poor hygiene, feelings of hopelessness, that's different. First step, identify your own symptoms of depression. If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself, tell someone. If you're not sure, you can try 800-lifenet or other support line to get feedback. First aid for depression includes: daily care and feeding, good sleeping and eating, lots of exercise--even when you don't feel like it-- healthy socializing, and focusing on talking to yourself in a positive way. If you aren't able to move yourself out of your depression,  work with a professional to make short-term goals and get some support. You may also talk to your doctor or psychiatrist about trying an anti-depressant to give you a little lift while you go through a rough patch.Best wishes,Karen","I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way, and I’m here to listen and support you. What you’re going through sounds incredibly painful, and it’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when so much is changing and hurting all at once.

It’s important to reach out to someone you trust—a friend, family member, teacher, or counselor—and let them know how you’re feeling. You don’t have to carry this weight by yourself. Talking to someone can help you feel less alone and give you the support you need to get through this.

299,"I've got so much anger. I don't know how to control myself. My girlfriend screams at me all the time, and sometime I don't know how to deal with life. I'm very depressed and angry. I feel lost.","Hi Campbell River, You say you have anger but you don't mention how it shows. Or maybe it doesn't. Are you aggressive with your girlfriend? Since you mention depression, I wonder if you're bottling it all up somewhere instead of letting it show at all. If this is the case, I admire your ability to not lash out at someone who's hurting you. However, if they are totally  unexpressed, anger turn inward and shift into depression. When she yells at you, what do you do? Is this the moment that you feel the most angry? I wouldn't be surprised; anger is a normal response to someone yelling at you. Something about anger...it's often there to cover up our more vulnerable emotions. Under the anger I wonder if you feel worthless, powerless, scared, unloved. Part of the trick to reducing anger is identifying those other emotions and expressing them. You say you don't know how to deal with life, and I think maybe you mean you don't know how to deal with emotions. Lots of people don't! This is confusing for most of us. What am I feeling? Why is it so strong? I'm afraid to express it for fear of hurting someone (or falling apart, or feeling alone...). How do I know what to express and what to be quiet about? These are all great questions to ask yourself, and a qualified therapist can help you sort it all out and support you in your growth. I wish you well!","I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're carrying a lot of emotional weight, and it’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when life feels so heavy. Let me offer some thoughts and suggestions that might help you navigate this difficult time:

---

### 1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**
   - It’s okay to feel angry, depressed, or lost. These emotions are valid, and acknowledging them is the first step toward understanding and managing them. Try to be kind to yourself—you’re human, and it’s normal to struggle sometimes.

---

### 2. **Find Healthy Outlets for Anger**
   - Anger can be destructive if it’s not channeled properly. Try to find healthy ways to release it:
     - **Physical activity:** Exercise, even something as simple as a walk or run, can help release pent-up energy.
     - **Creative expression:** Write, draw, or play music to process your emotions.
     - **Deep breathing or meditation:** These can help calm your mind and body when you feel overwhelmed.

---

### 3. **Communicate with Your Girlfriend**
   - It sounds like your relationship is adding to your stress. When things are calm, try to have an open and honest conversation with her. Use “I” statements to express how you feel (e.g., “I feel hurt when we argue like this”) instead of blaming or accusing. If the yelling continues, consider seeking couples counseling to work on communication together.

---

### 4. **Seek Support**
   - You don’t have to go through this alone. Reach out to someone you trust—a friend, family member, or therapist—to talk about what you’re feeling. A therapist, in particular, can help you explore your emotions and develop coping strategies.

---

### 5. **Take Small Steps**
   - When life feels overwhelming, break it down into smaller, manageable steps. Focus on one thing at a time, whether it’s getting through the day, completing a task, or simply taking a moment to breathe.

---

### 6. **Practice Self-Compassion**
   - Be gentle with yourself. You’re doing the best you can in a tough situation. Remind yourself that it’s okay to not have all the answers right now.

---

### 7. **Consider Professional Help**
   - If your depression and anger feel unmanageable, it might be helpful to talk to a mental health professional. They can provide tools and strategies to help you feel more in control.

---

### 8. **Focus on What You Can Control**
   - Life can feel chaotic, but there are always things within your control—your reactions, your self-care, and the steps you take to improve your situation. Start small, and build from there.

---

### 9. **Remember: This Is Temporary**
   - As hard as it feels right now, emotions and circumstances can change. You’re not stuck in this place forever. With time, effort, and support, things can get better.

---

You’re not alone in this. It takes courage to acknowledge how you’re feeling and seek ways to improve your situation. Be patient with yourself, and take it one step at a time. You deserve peace and happiness, and it’s possible to find your way there.",0.4789832830429077
2043,Does counseling really do anything that can help people?,"Hi!  Great question.  I believe counseling does help people! Of course, I am a therapist, so I would think that! :)  Seriously - I think therapy and counseling allow us to understand ourselves, our motivations and the things that bring us happiness and discontent.  Therapy can create opportunities to try new skills and enhance positive attributes that are already present in someone.  I like to think of therapy as an unbiased ""aerial view"" of our lives. Someone outside can often help us notice things we might otherwise miss. Hope this helps!","Yes, counseling can be highly effective in helping people navigate a variety of challenges and improve their mental and emotional well-being. Here are some ways counseling can be beneficial:

1. **Emotional Support**: Counseling provides a safe, non-judgmental space for individuals to express their feelings and experiences. This can be especially valuable for those who feel isolated or misunderstood.

2. **Coping Strategies**: Counselors can teach practical skills and techniques to manage stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. These tools can empower individuals to handle difficult situations more effectively.

3. **Insight and Self-Awareness**: Through counseling, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This self-awareness can lead to personal growth and positive change.

4. **Problem-Solving**: Counselors can help individuals identify and address specific problems or challenges in their lives, whether they are related to relationships, work, or personal goals.

5. **Behavioral Change**: Counseling can assist individuals in breaking unhealthy patterns and developing healthier habits. This can include addressing issues like addiction, anger management, or communication problems.

6. **Support for Trauma**: For those who have experienced trauma, counseling can provide specialized support to process and heal from these experiences. Techniques like trauma-focused therapy can be particularly effective.

7. **Improved Relationships**: Counseling can help individuals improve their interpersonal skills and navigate conflicts in relationships, leading to healthier and more fulfilling connections with others.

8. **Mental Health Management**: For those with mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder, counseling can be an essential part of a comprehensive treatment plan, often in conjunction with medication.

9. **Crisis Intervention**: In times of acute distress or crisis, counseling can provide immediate support and help individuals stabilize and find a path forward.

10. **Holistic Well-Being**: Counseling can address not just mental health, but also how it intersects with physical health, lifestyle, and overall quality of life.

The effectiveness of counseling often depends on the individual’s willingness to engage in the process, the quality of the therapeutic relationship, and the counselor’s expertise. Different approaches, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, or mindfulness-based therapy, may be more suitable for different individuals and issues.

It’s important to note that while counseling can be incredibly helpful, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and some individuals may need to try different therapists or approaches to find what works best for them.",0.5235311985015869
1432,"My mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back, and I can't seem to forgive her. I want to say that it's okay, but I can't. I feel like even if I did forgive her, I wouldn't be able to say it to her face.","How someone feels when they forgive another, is at peace with themselves and their understanding of what went wrong, who was responsible for what in the situation, and clarity on their own motivation, actions, emotions including pain, regret, resentment, sadness.These steps ideally allow a new door to open in order to develop new paths in the existing relationship or accept that this will not be possible due to either person's way of handling themselves.The long answer would be that you're not yet through with this process.I commend you on being truthful with yourself about yourself.You're on the right track by expecting to feel resolved when you've reached resolution, and not before.Finding patience with the unpredictable amount of time needed to thoroughly examine all the details of the incidents you mention, sometimes is a frustration of its own.Keep up your good work of knowing your own life.It is a worthwhile endeavor!","It’s completely valid to feel this way. Forgiveness is a deeply personal and often complex process, and it doesn’t always happen quickly or easily. It’s okay to acknowledge that you’re not ready to forgive your mom yet, and it’s also okay to feel conflicted about it. Here are a few thoughts that might help you navigate this:

1. **Understand That Forgiveness Is for You, Not Her**: Forgiveness doesn’t mean excusing or forgetting what happened. It’s about releasing the hold that anger or resentment has on you. It’s a way to find peace for yourself, even if the relationship doesn’t fully heal.

2. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: It’s important to honor your emotions—whether it’s anger, hurt, disappointment, or something else. Try journaling or talking to someone you trust to process these feelings. You don’t have to rush to forgive before you’re ready.

3. **Consider Her Perspective**: While this doesn’t justify her actions, understanding her circumstances or mindset at the time might help you see her as human, capable of mistakes. This doesn’t mean you have to condone what she did, but it might help you find empathy.

4. **Take Small Steps**: If you’re not ready to forgive fully, you can start by letting go of small pieces of resentment. For example, you might decide to stop revisiting certain memories or to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship.

5. **You Don’t Have to Say It Out Loud**: Forgiveness doesn’t always require a conversation. If you’re not ready to talk to her about it, you can work on forgiving her in your own heart and mind. When or if you’re ready to express it to her, it can be in your own time and way.

6. **Set Boundaries if Needed**: Forgiveness doesn’t mean you have to allow the same behavior to continue. It’s okay to set boundaries to protect yourself, even as you work toward letting go of the past.

7. **Seek Support if Necessary**: If the pain feels overwhelming or you’re struggling to move forward, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you work through these emotions in a healthy way.

Remember, forgiveness is a journey, not a destination. It’s okay to take your time and approach it in a way that feels right for you. Be patient with yourself, and know that it’s possible to find peace, even if it doesn’t happen right away.",0.46184587478637695
2856,"I’m in my early 20s. My ex’s parents are friends with them and have told them bad things about me. I left my ex due to an abusive situation, and they are making me look like I was the bad one.","Maybe you can talk with your partner about this first look at the different elements of a possible conversation in the future. If you are at a place where you are willing or able to disclose the reason that you left your ex, that could be one element of the discussion, but it doesn't have to be.I don't know how long we have been together with your current partner, but perhaps his or her parents would see you for who you are and make their own opinions over time. That may be a discussion to have with them as well.Hopefully your partner will be a good sounding board before these conversations.","I’m really sorry you’re going through this—it sounds incredibly painful and unfair. Leaving an abusive relationship is an act of courage, and it’s deeply unfair for anyone to twist the narrative to make you look like the “bad one.” Here’s how you can approach this situation with strength and clarity:

---

### 1. **Remind Yourself of the Truth**
   - You know why you left the relationship, and your safety and well-being were (and are) the priority. No one else’s opinion can change the reality of what you experienced.
   - It’s natural to feel hurt by their words, but don’t let their version of events make you doubt yourself. You did what was right for you.

---

### 2. **Set Boundaries**
   - If your ex’s parents or anyone else is spreading false information about you, it’s okay to distance yourself from them. You don’t owe them an explanation or engagement.
   - If mutual friends are involved, you can calmly and briefly share your side of the story if you feel comfortable, but avoid getting into a back-and-forth argument.

---

### 3. **Focus on Your Support System**
   - Surround yourself with people who care about you and understand the truth of your situation. Lean on friends, family, or a therapist who can provide emotional support and validation.
   - If you’re not already seeing a therapist, it might be helpful to talk to someone who specializes in trauma or abusive relationships. They can help you process your feelings and build resilience.

---

### 4. **Let Go of What You Can’t Control**
   - You can’t control what your ex’s parents say or how others perceive you. Trying to change their minds or “prove” yourself may only drain your energy.
   - Focus on living your life authentically and building a future that makes you happy. Over time, people who matter will see the truth.

---

### 5. **Consider Legal or Professional Help (If Necessary)**
   - If their actions escalate to harassment, defamation, or threats, you may want to consult a lawyer or seek advice from a domestic violence organization. They can guide you on how to protect yourself legally.

---

### 6. **Practice Self-Compassion**
   - Healing from an abusive relationship takes time, and it’s okay to feel hurt, angry, or frustrated. Be kind to yourself and prioritize your mental and emotional well-being.
   - Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you rebuild your sense of self-worth.

---

### 7. **Remember: You’re Not Alone**
   - Many people who leave abusive relationships face similar challenges, where the abuser or their allies try to shift the blame. This is a common tactic, but it doesn’t make it true.
   - There are communities and resources (like domestic violence hotlines or support groups) that can offer guidance and solidarity.

I want it to go away, and I want to make my woman happy again.","It is completely understandable that you would like to find a way to make these intrusive thoughts go away, however, your feeling that you can't control having these thoughts is accurate. It's also understandable that you would feel helpless and guilty, given that you see how these thoughts are effecting your relationship, though I would encourage you to go easy on yourself and remember that you aren't choosing to have these thoughts. I'm sure that if there was a switch to turn them off, you would flip it.There is no magic technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away, however, therapy may still have a lot to offer.

Struggling with intrusive thoughts or sexual fantasies that feel out of your control can be distressing, especially when it impacts your relationship. Here are some steps to help you navigate this:

---

### 1. **Understand and Normalize Your Feelings**
   - Sexual thoughts and fantasies are a natural part of being human. They don’t define who you are or your values.

---

### 2. **Communicate Openly with Your Partner**
   - Honesty and vulnerability can strengthen your relationship. Share your feelings with your partner in a way that emphasizes your love and commitment to her.

   - Reflect on what might be triggering these thoughts. Are they linked to stress, boredom, exposure to certain media, or unresolved emotions?
   - Once you identify triggers, you can work on minimizing or managing them.

---

### 4. **Practice Mindfulness**
   - Mindfulness techniques can help you observe your thoughts without acting on them or judging yourself.
   - When a thought arises, acknowledge it and let it pass without engaging with it. Over time, this can reduce their intensity.

---

### 5. **Focus on Emotional Intimacy**

I am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body. I don't want my partner to think differently of me because I am afraid of having sex.","As hard as it may be to do this, since all the media and marketing of how an ideal person looks and performs sexually, surrounds us, keep in mind that the images presented in order to sell movies and almost any product, is meant to trigger fantasies.No one is a fantasy, we are all real and unique.  We can be influenced to believe that being a fantasy is better than being who each of us is, genuinely.Your partner may be much more accepting of your body and your level of sexual experience, than you are of yourself!Sex within a relationship means the two people want to have with the other one, not because they have ideal bodies and expertise, but because the person wants to make love to the one whom they love.When you are in a loving relationship, part of this includes talking about sensitivities and insecurities.  Having a conversation gives the chance to know that you are accepted for who you are, not how closely you resemble a made up idea meant to persuade people to buy items.","It’s completely normal to feel nervous or anxious about having sex, especially if it’s your first time or if you’re unsure about your partner’s expectations.

   - If you’re unsure about their expectations regarding your experience level, it’s okay to clarify. Honesty can strengthen trust and ease anxiety.

### 2. **Remember That Inexperience Is Not a Flaw**
   - Everyone starts somewhere, and there’s no “right” way to be experienced. Sex is a learning process, and it’s okay to take your time to explore what feels good for you and your partner.
   - A caring partner will be patient and understanding, not judgmental.

### 3. **Focus on Your Body Positivity**
   - It’s common to feel self-conscious about your body, but try to remind yourself that your partner is with you because they’re attracted to you. Confidence often comes from within, so practice self-love and focus on the things you appreciate about yourself.
   - If it helps, wear something that makes you feel comfortable and confident during intimate moments.

### 4. **Take Things at Your Own Pace**
   - You don’t have to rush into anything. Take the time you need to feel ready and comfortable. Sex should be a consensual and enjoyable experience for both partners.
   - If you’re not ready yet, it’s okay to wait. A good partner will respect your boundaries.

### 5. **Educate Yourself**
   - Learning about sex and intimacy can help ease some of your fears. Read articles, books, or watch reputable resources to understand what to expect and how to communicate your needs.
   - Remember, sex is about connection and pleasure, not performance.

### 6. **Address Your Fears**
   - If your fears feel overwhelming, consider talking to a therapist or counselor who specializes in sexual health or relationships. They can help you work through your anxieties in a safe and supportive environment.

### 7. **Trust the Process**
   - Intimacy is about building a connection with your partner. It’s okay if things don’t go perfectly the first time—what matters is that you’re both comfortable and respectful of each other’s feelings.

### 8. **Reassure Yourself**
   - Remind yourself that your worth is not tied to your sexual experience or your body. You are valuable and deserving of love and respect just as you are.

### 9. **Set Boundaries**
   - It’s okay to set boundaries and communicate what you’re comfortable with. A healthy relationship involves mutual respect and understanding.

### 10. **Focus on the Connection**
   - Sex is just one part of a relationship. Focus on building emotional intimacy and trust with your partner, which can make the physical aspect feel more natural and less intimidating.

Remember, your feelings are valid, and it’s okay to take your time. A supportive partner will prioritize your comfort and well-being. If you ever feel pressured or uncomfortable, it’s important to speak up and prioritize your own needs. You deserve to feel safe, respected, and confident in any intimate situation.",0.4262624979019165
501,"I never feel like myself. I can’t even think straight anymore. I start stuttering and I can’t remember anything. I always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with, what feels like, someone else. I don’t know why I feel this way, but I hate it.","What you are describing sounds like it may be a form of dissociation. Dissociation is our mind's way of disconnecting us from aspects of our experience in an attempt to protect us in overwhelming situations. It also sounds like you are noticing anxiety in certain situations. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into these experiences, learn skills for coping with anxiety and reconnecting with yourself, and alleviate these symptoms over time.","I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way. What you’re describing sounds incredibly overwhelming and distressing. It’s important to acknowledge that these feelings and experiences are valid, and you’re not alone in struggling with them. Let’s break this down and explore some possibilities and steps you can take to feel more like yourself again.

### 1. **Understanding What’s Happening**
   - **Mental Fog and Memory Issues:** Difficulty thinking clearly, remembering things, or stuttering can be signs of stress, anxiety, or even burnout. When your mind is overwhelmed, it can feel like you’re not in control of your thoughts or speech.
   - **Inner Conflict:** Feeling like you’re fighting with “someone else” could indicate internalized stress, self-criticism, or even a deeper emotional or psychological struggle. This could be related to unresolved emotions, past experiences, or ongoing challenges in your life.

### 2. **Possible Causes**
   - **Stress and Anxiety:** Chronic stress or anxiety can disrupt your ability to think clearly, remember things, and feel like yourself. It can also lead to physical symptoms like stuttering or feeling on edge.
   - **Depression:** Depression can cause feelings of detachment, mental fog, and a sense of not being yourself. It can also lead to negative self-talk and inner conflict.
   - **Trauma or Past Experiences:** If you’ve experienced trauma or difficult life events, these can resurface in ways that feel like you’re fighting with yourself or disconnected from who you are.
   - **Burnout:** If you’ve been under prolonged pressure (work, school, relationships, etc.), burnout can make you feel emotionally and mentally drained.
   - **Physical Health Issues:** Sometimes, mental fog and emotional struggles can be linked to physical health problems, such as hormonal imbalances, sleep disorders, or nutritional deficiencies.

### 3. **What You Can Do**
   - **Reach Out for Support:** Talking to someone you trust—a friend, family member, or therapist—can help you process what you’re feeling. A mental health professional can provide guidance and help you explore these feelings in a safe space.
   - **Practice Self-Compassion:** Try to be gentle with yourself. It’s okay to feel this way, and you’re not failing by struggling. Remind yourself that these feelings are temporary and can improve with time and care.
   - **Grounding Techniques:** When you feel overwhelmed, grounding exercises can help. For example:
     - Focus on your breathing: Take slow, deep breaths.
     - Use your senses: Notice 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste.
   - **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you make sense of them and identify patterns or triggers.
   - **Prioritize Self-Care:** Even small acts of self-care—like getting enough sleep, eating nourishing foods, and moving your body—can make a difference in how you feel.
   - **Limit Stressors:** If possible, identify and reduce sources of stress in your life. It’s okay to set boundaries and take breaks when needed.

### 4. **When to Seek Professional Help**
   If these feelings persist or worsen, it’s important to seek help from a mental health professional. They can help you explore what’s going on and develop strategies to feel more like yourself again. If you ever feel unsafe or like you’re losing control, reach out to a crisis hotline or emergency services immediately.

### 5. **You’re Not Alone**
   Many people go through periods where they don’t feel like themselves, and it’s okay to ask for help. You deserve support and understanding as you navigate this. Remember, healing is a process, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time.

927,"My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the ""straight and narrow"" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that I'm not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others.    His insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","You are right that his insecurities are at the root of the issue.  You cannot change that for him.  He will have to do the work to handle those emotions on his own.  What you can do is reassure him in whatever ways possible, but always recognizing that you can't ""fix"" this for him.  When I work with people who struggle with their partner's past experiences, I always frame it like this:  Everything that you've experienced has resulted in you being the person you are today.  The person they claim to love.  If you had not gone through some of those experiences, you would not be in the position you're in now, ready to commit to him and know that you're satisfied with that.  Just as when bad things happen to us, we have to find a way to appreciate the lessons learned your fiance has to accept that you're the person you are today because of what you have gone through.  Celebrate that you have moved through that and have landed in this perfect position with him!Hope that helps, Allison","It’s understandable that this situation is challenging for both of you, especially given your shared Christian background and the values tied to it. Here are some steps you can take to help your fiancé process his feelings and move toward healing and acceptance:

### 1. **Open and Honest Communication**
   - **Express Your Feelings:** Share how his insecurities and focus on your past are affecting you and the relationship. Use “I” statements to avoid sounding accusatory (e.g., “I feel hurt when my past is brought up because I want us to focus on our future together”).
   - **Listen to His Concerns:** Give him space to express his feelings without judgment. Understanding his perspective can help you address his insecurities more effectively.

### 2. **Reaffirm Your Commitment**
   - Remind him of your love and commitment to him and your shared future. Let him know that your past does not define who you are now or the relationship you’re building together.

### 3. **Encourage Self-Reflection**
   - Help him recognize that his struggles with acceptance may stem from his own insecurities or unresolved feelings about his past. Encourage him to reflect on why he’s fixating on your past and how it relates to his self-worth.

### 4. **Focus on Forgiveness and Grace**
   - As Christians, emphasize the importance of forgiveness and God’s grace. Remind him that everyone has a past, and what matters is how you live your lives moving forward. Share scriptures like 2 Corinthians 5:17 (“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!”).

### 5. **Seek Counseling**
   - **Couples Counseling:** A Christian counselor can help you both navigate these issues in a safe and constructive way. They can provide tools to improve communication and address insecurities.
   - **Individual Counseling:** If he’s struggling with self-acceptance or forgiveness, individual therapy might help him work through these challenges.

### 6. **Pray Together**
   - Pray for your relationship, for healing, and for the ability to let go of the past. Inviting God into the process can bring peace and clarity.

### 7. **Set Boundaries**
   - If his focus on your past becomes overwhelming or hurtful, gently set boundaries. Let him know that while you’re willing to discuss his feelings, dwelling on the past is not healthy for your relationship.

### 8. **Model Acceptance and Grace**
   - Show him unconditional love and acceptance, even as he works through his struggles. Your example of grace may help him learn to extend the same to himself and others.

### 9. **Focus on the Future**
   - Shift the conversation to your shared goals, dreams, and the life you’re building together. Help him see that your past is not as important as the future you’re creating.

### 10. **Be Patient**
   - Change takes time, especially when dealing with deep-seated insecurities. Be patient with him as he works through his feelings, but also take care of your own emotional well-being.

Remember, a strong relationship is built on mutual trust, forgiveness, and a shared commitment to growth. By addressing these issues together with love and grace, you can help your fiancé move past his insecurities and focus on the present and future.",0.44831258058547974
196,"How do I make myself happy without the people who made me happy? Now that they’re gone, I feel sad. It’s been two months now but I seem to be unable to stay okay and independent.","It sounds like you have been feeling pretty down, since the loss of a relationship, and you're wondering how to be happy by yourself. Intimacy is a very natural human desire and at the same time learning to enjoy ourselves, even when we are alone, can strengthen our ability to lead a satisfying life in and out of relationship. Working with a therapist, you may be able to gain insight into how you show up in your relationships with yourself and others and discover more fulfilling ways to do so.","I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way. It’s completely normal to feel sad and lost when the people who brought you joy are no longer in your life. Healing takes time, and it’s okay to grieve their absence. Here are some steps that might help you find happiness and independence again:

---

### **1. Acknowledge Your Feelings**
- Allow yourself to feel sad, angry, or whatever emotions come up. Suppressing them can make it harder to heal.

---

### **6. Find Joy in Small Things**
- Pay attention to the little moments that bring you happiness—a beautiful sunset, a good book, or a favorite song.
- Gratitude journaling can help you focus on the positive aspects of your life.

---

### **7. Set Personal Goals**
- Having something to work toward can give you a sense of direction. Start with small, achievable goals and celebrate your progress.

- Celebrate small victories, even if it’s just getting out of bed or smiling at something funny.

---

### **10. Remember Their Impact**
- While the people who made you happy may no longer be in your life, their influence and the memories you shared will always be a part of you. Honor those memories in a way that feels meaningful to you.

940,"I'm a young adult woman, and I have trouble finding my true identity being at home. This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I don't know why. I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldn't like it. My parents are very religious—they're Christians. We did things every time he'd come over to my house. We didn't have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we'd watch movies by ourselves.
   One day, my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. As soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. They were both aggravated. They told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. They said he wanted me for sex and he's not a Christian. I took their advice and broke up with him. Once we broke up for about a month, I decided to get back together with him a little after school started. My parents found out eventually, and I decided to not listen this time. I would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and God totally forbids him. I would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually I would just never listen to my parents. They're always yelling at me about how I shouldn't date this boy. I felt too old to listen to them. Now I'm kind of just stuck. Is the real me religious? Have I been brainwashed by him? I don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think I'm deceiving because of it. They threatened me that if I'm still with him, I can't do track and they won't support me. They've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. They say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. I'm actually very happy with him. They also say I'm living a separate life at home than I am at school. They say they want what's best for me and love me because they adopted me.","What a tough situation you must be in, feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you. I would say the first thing you want to do is (if you haven't already), have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents, telling them how you feel and letting them know what you need from them. If communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward. You, unfortunately, will not be able to change your parent's feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from the relationship you have with your parents. It always helps to try and see things from another angle. You might want to, for example, try and understand your parent's perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset. Validating other's feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively. Are you living with your parents and do they support you? If so, are you willing to give that up should you decide to not follow their rules? Know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply. Your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper. Not everyone will always approve of the choices we make and sometimes we need to be okay with that. Best of luck to you.","It sounds like you're in a very challenging and emotionally complex situation, and I want to acknowledge how difficult it must be to navigate these conflicting feelings and relationships. You’re grappling with questions about your identity, your values, and how to balance your own desires with the expectations of your parents. This is a lot to process, and it’s okay to feel stuck or unsure. Let’s break this down and explore some ways to approach it.

---

### 1. **Understanding Your Identity**
   - **Religion and Values**: You’ve grown up in a religious household, but it’s natural to question or redefine your beliefs as you grow older and experience life. Ask yourself: *What do I truly believe in? Do I feel connected to my faith, or am I following it because of my parents’ expectations?* It’s okay if your beliefs evolve—this is part of discovering your true self.
   - **Independence vs. Family Influence**: As a young adult, you’re at a stage where you’re figuring out who you are separate from your parents. This can lead to tension, especially if your choices conflict with their values. It’s important to recognize that *your identity is your own*, and it’s okay to make decisions that feel right for you, even if they differ from what your parents want.

---

### 2. **Your Relationship with Your Boyfriend**
   - **Your Feelings**: You’ve mentioned that you’re happy with your boyfriend. It’s important to reflect on why you feel this way. Does he respect you? Does he support your growth and independence? Are you happy because of who he is, or because being with him feels like a way to assert your independence from your parents?
   - **Your Parents’ Concerns**: While your parents’ approach may feel harsh, they might be coming from a place of fear or worry. However, their words and actions (like calling you names or threatening to withdraw support) are hurtful and not helpful. It’s okay to set boundaries with them if their behavior is toxic or manipulative.

---

### 3. **Your Relationship with Your Parents**
   - **Communication**: It seems like communication with your parents has broken down. If possible, try to have an open and calm conversation with them. Let them know that you love and appreciate them, but you also need space to make your own decisions. You might say something like, *“I understand you’re worried about me, but I need to figure things out for myself. I hope you can trust me to make my own choices.”*
   - **Boundaries**: If their behavior becomes too overwhelming or hurtful, it’s okay to set boundaries. For example, you might say, *“I won’t tolerate being called names or threatened. I want to have a respectful relationship with you.”*

---

### 4. **Navigating Guilt and Confusion**
   - **Guilt**: You’ve mentioned feeling guilty about your actions, but it’s important to separate guilt imposed by others from your own feelings. Ask yourself: *Do I feel guilty because I truly regret my actions, or because I’m afraid of disappointing my parents?* It’s okay to make mistakes and learn from them—this is part of growing up.
   - **Confusion**: Feeling torn between your parents’ expectations and your own desires is normal. Take time to reflect on what *you* want, not what others expect of you. Journaling or talking to a trusted friend or counselor can help you process these feelings.

---

### 5. **Moving Forward**
   - **Self-Reflection**: Spend time thinking about what makes you happy and fulfilled. What are your goals, values, and priorities? This will help you make decisions that align with your true self.
   - **Support System**: If possible, seek support from friends, mentors, or a counselor who can provide a neutral and understanding perspective. A counselor can also help you navigate your relationship with your parents and your boyfriend in a healthy way.
   - **Independence**: If your parents’ threats (like withdrawing support for track) feel overwhelming, consider what steps you can take to become more independent. This might include finding part-time work, exploring scholarships, or building a support network outside of your family.

### Final Thoughts
It’s clear that you’re trying to figure out who you are and what you want in life, which is a sign of maturity and self-awareness. Remember, you don’t have to have all the answers right now—this is a journey. Be kind to yourself, and trust that you have the strength to navigate this situation.

2256,"I have been with my best friend for over a year, and we have had a beautiful baby girl. We were in love, and I still love her dearly. I am in my late teens and so is she. She says she has lost her connection with me. She is talking to a random guy that she says is just someone to talk to. But she says she still loves me. I'm very hurt and confused.","Congrats on having your daughter!Have you told your partner about your feelings of ""hurt and confused""?This is one possible way of opening a conversation about the different ways you each feel about one another and whether either of you would like changing or continuing to live together, in light of the change in emotional connection.The first step of having a dialogue about a relationship is being clear on what you are feeling, what you are willing to contribute to the relationship and what you would like having in return from your partner.Ask your partner if she is willing to have a conversation on these topics.  Then, allow some time so each of you is clear about their own expectations and what is possible to offer the other.This is a fairly complex process and very often is difficult to keep on track without outside help to keep the discussion focused.It is normal for emotions to override our logic when discussing matters we care about deeply.If the conversations don't go very far, or if your partner has no interest in talking, stick with your own interest to more fully understand matters.Interview some therapists to find one whom you feel helps you clarify and find direction for yourself about this situation.","I’m so sorry you’re going through this—it sounds like a really painful and confusing situation. Being in your late teens and navigating a relationship, parenthood, and emotions like this is incredibly challenging. Here’s some guidance to help you process this and decide how to move forward:

---

### 1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**
It’s completely valid to feel hurt, confused, and even scared right now. You’re dealing with a lot—parenthood, a changing relationship, and your own emotions. Give yourself permission to feel what you’re feeling without judgment.

---

### 2. **Communicate Openly and Calmly**
If you haven’t already, have an honest conversation with her about how you’re feeling. Use “I” statements to express your emotions without blaming her. For example:
- “I feel hurt and confused when you say you’ve lost your connection with me.”
- “I’m worried about our relationship and where we stand.”

Ask her to share her feelings too. Try to understand where she’s coming from, even if it’s hard to hear.

---

### 3. **Set Boundaries**
If her talking to this other guy makes you uncomfortable, let her know. It’s okay to express that you feel uneasy about it, especially if it’s affecting your relationship. However, avoid being controlling or accusatory—focus on how it makes you feel and what you need to feel secure.

---

### 4. **Reflect on the Relationship**
Take some time to think about your relationship as a whole. Are there underlying issues that might have led to this disconnect? Are both of you putting in the effort to make the relationship work? Parenthood is a huge responsibility, and it’s common for relationships to face challenges during this time.

---

### 5. **Focus on Your Baby**
Your daughter is the most important thing right now. Regardless of what happens between you and her mother, try to maintain a positive and supportive co-parenting relationship. Your baby needs both of you to be present and loving.

---

### 6. **Take Care of Yourself**
This is a tough time, and it’s easy to neglect your own well-being. Make sure you’re eating, sleeping, and taking time for yourself. Consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor to help you process your emotions.

---

### 7. **Be Prepared for Any Outcome**
It’s possible that your relationship may change or even end, and that’s incredibly hard to face. But it’s important to prepare yourself emotionally for any outcome. Remember, you are still young, and you have a lot of life ahead of you. Even if things don’t work out romantically, you can still be a great dad and build a fulfilling life.

---

### 8. **Seek Support**
If you’re struggling to cope, don’t hesitate to reach out for help. A counselor or therapist can provide guidance and support as you navigate this difficult time. Many communities also have resources for young parents that can offer assistance.

---

### Final Thoughts
It’s clear that you love her deeply, and it’s painful to feel like the connection has changed. But relationships require effort from both sides, and sometimes people grow apart—especially when they’re young and facing big life changes like parenthood.

---

### 1. **You’re Not Alone**
   - Many people struggle with feelings of worthlessness, social anxiety, intrusive thoughts, or difficulty connecting with others. These feelings don’t define you, and they can be managed with the right support.

---

### 2. **Intrusive Thoughts and Voices**
   - The voices and thoughts you’re experiencing (e.g., thoughts about hurting others or yourself) could be a sign of a mental health condition, such as **obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)**, **psychosis**, or **severe anxiety**. These thoughts can feel overwhelming, but they don’t mean you’ll act on them. It’s important to talk to a mental health professional about this.

---

### 3. **Social Anxiety and Paranoia**
   - Feeling like people are talking about you or making fun of you could be related to **social anxiety** or **paranoia**. These feelings can make it hard to trust others or feel comfortable in social situations. Therapy can help you work through these thoughts and build confidence.

---

### 4. **Feelings of Worthlessness**
   - Feeling like you don’t fit in or that you’d be better off not in this world is a sign of **depression** or **suicidal ideation**. These feelings are very serious, and it’s crucial to reach out for help immediately. You are not worthless, and there are people who care about you and want to help.

---

### 5. **What You Can Do**

2674,"Last year, I just always felt hopeless. I don't have a great relationship with my sister. I lost my mother recently, and that really added to my sadness. My sister always brings up how I was never close to my mother.","Wow what a painful journey you have been in for a long time. Death and grief bring up so many painful reminders of relationships--what they could have been, never were, and what was lost. With death of a family member the family often falls apart for a while... or longer. I hope you can find some support for you and your pain that was occurring before your mom's passing. I also hope you can find someone to help you set boundaries with your sister so you can have your time (as long as you need) to heal from losing your mom and then later figure out how to interact with your sister. ","I’m so sorry you’re going through such a difficult time. Losing your mother is an incredibly painful experience, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed with sadness. Grieving is a deeply personal process, and there’s no “right” way to navigate it. It’s okay to feel hopeless, especially when you’re dealing with such a significant loss.

It sounds like your relationship with your sister is adding to your pain. When she brings up how you were never close to your mother, it might feel like she’s invalidating your grief or reopening wounds. It’s possible that she’s also struggling with her own emotions and may not realize how her words are affecting you. However, that doesn’t make it any easier for you to hear.

Here are a few thoughts that might help:

1. **Your Grief is Valid**: No matter what your relationship with your mother was like, your feelings of loss are real and valid. Grief isn’t just about the relationship you had—it’s also about the relationship you wish you could have had, the memories, and the finality of the loss.

2. **Set Boundaries with Your Sister**: If her comments are hurtful, it’s okay to set boundaries. You might say something like, “I’m really struggling with Mom’s passing, and it’s hard for me when you bring up our relationship. I need some space to process my feelings.”

3. **Seek Support**: Grief can feel isolating, but you don’t have to go through it alone. Consider talking to a therapist, joining a grief support group, or confiding in a trusted friend. Sometimes, having someone to listen without judgment can make a world of difference.

4. **Be Gentle with Yourself**: Healing takes time, and it’s okay to have moments of sadness, anger, or confusion. Try to treat yourself with the same kindness and compassion you would offer a close friend going through a tough time.

5. **Consider Your Relationship with Your Sister**: If you feel ready, you might try to have an open and honest conversation with her about how her words affect you. It’s possible she doesn’t realize the impact she’s having, and this could be an opportunity to improve your relationship.

Remember, it’s okay to take things one day at a time. Healing isn’t linear, and it’s okay to have setbacks. You’re not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to support you through this.",0.4906153082847595
289,"I was anxious to go to middle school. I was afraid of what people might say about me, so when school started, I wasn't acting like myself. I was quiet, which I'm usually not. I didn't talk to anybody and didn't have any friends. Then a few years later, my grandma died. I really became depressed and stop going to school for a little. I hated myself and still do. I just need help. I need someone to care for me. I need someone to show that they care.","I agree; you need more care and support. No one deserves to feel alone, or like they hate themselves. We're all wonderful, imperfect, complicated people and we're at our best when we're all helping each other. I'm glad you wrote this question, because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes. I can tell that you're smart, because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connected...you ""not being yourself"", and then how you felt when your grandma died. When Grandma died, you needed and deserved extra love and support, but the people around you didn't seem to give it to you, maybe. My hunch is that they wanted to, but that they didn't know how much you needed it, or what you needed exactly. The older you get, the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need. Maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature, but that's how it works. When you started middle school, it sounds like you changed; you got more quiet, right? That must have felt weird, to not be acting like yourself. It sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldn't like you. Fear can be silly. So then, fear got you to not show yourself, and when we don't show ourselves, people can't see who we are; they don't know us as well and then they don't know what we need and they can't care for us as well either. Fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you. It does that to a lot of us. So, where you're at right now is because of what fear did to you, and also because when Grandma died you were already isolated so people couldn't see your pain and know that you needed support. There's a simple solution, but you'd have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say ""Get off my back!"". ""You're not helping me by telling me lies."" Can you be brave enough to go back to your old, louder, self? If you talk to the people closest to you...tell them what you think and how you feel, then they'll be able to give you the care that you want and deserve. I wish you well as you try this!","I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid. It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot of pain and loneliness for a long time, and that’s incredibly hard to go through alone. You’ve been through so much—starting middle school, losing your grandma, and feeling disconnected from others. It’s okay to feel the way you do, and it’s okay to ask for help.

First, I want you to know that you are not alone, even if it feels that way right now. There are people who care about you and want to help, even if it doesn’t always feel like it. You deserve to feel loved, supported, and valued for who you are. You are not defined by your struggles or by the things you hate about yourself. You are so much more than that.

Here are a few steps you can take to start feeling better and finding the care you need:

1. **Talk to Someone You Trust**: This could be a family member, teacher, school counselor, or even a close friend. Sharing your feelings with someone who cares can help lighten the burden. If you’re not sure who to talk to, a school counselor is a great place to start—they’re trained to help students who are struggling.

2. **Seek Professional Help**: A therapist or counselor can provide a safe space for you to express your feelings and work through your pain. Therapy can help you understand and manage your emotions, build self-esteem, and develop coping strategies. You don’t have to go through this alone—there are professionals who want to help.

3. **Be Kind to Yourself**: It’s easy to be hard on yourself when you’re feeling down, but try to treat yourself with the same kindness you’d show a friend. You’re going through a tough time, and it’s okay to not be okay. Small steps forward are still progress.

4. **Find a Support System**: Whether it’s joining a club, talking to a trusted adult, or connecting with people who share your interests, building a support system can help you feel less alone. Even one person who cares can make a big difference.

5. **Express Yourself**: Writing in a journal, drawing, or finding another creative outlet can help you process your emotions. Sometimes putting your feelings into words or art can be incredibly healing.

6. **Take Things One Day at a Time**: Healing and feeling better won’t happen overnight, and that’s okay. Focus on small, manageable steps, and celebrate even the smallest victories.

You are worthy of love, care, and happiness, even if it doesn’t feel that way right now. Reaching out for help is a brave and important step, and I’m proud of you for recognizing that you need support. Please don’t give up on yourself—there is hope, and things can get better. You matter, and your feelings matter. You are not alone in this.",0.49850982427597046
1832,"Every time I send a message to someone or a group message on Instagram, iMessage, or snapchat people will read my messages but then they won't answer me.    Could it be that there is something they don't like about me? I don't understand why they won't answer my messages. How do I get people to respond to me?","I understand the feeling of not being liked due to not having any responses on the sites you list.More than likely the non-response has less to do with liking you than w liking the way you write your messages.Have you tried asking a question in your posts?  This would be one way to invite people to answer your post.When you write,  imagine yourself as the reader of the post.If you think about the wording of a question which would motivate you to respond, then this formula will very likely be the same for many others who read your post.Good luck!","I'm sorry you're feeling this way—it can be really frustrating and disheartening when people don't respond to your messages. While it’s natural to wonder if it’s about you, there are many possible reasons why people might not respond, and it’s not necessarily about you personally. Here are some things to consider and tips to encourage more responses:

---

### **Possible Reasons People Aren’t Responding**
1. **They’re Busy or Distracted**  
   People often read messages but get sidetracked by work, school, or other responsibilities and forget to reply.

2. **The Message Doesn’t Require a Response**  
   If your messages are statements or don’t include a clear question or call to action, people might not feel the need to respond.

3. **They’re Overwhelmed**  
   Some people feel overwhelmed by the constant flow of messages and notifications, leading them to delay or skip responses.

4. **They’re Unsure How to Respond**  
   If your messages are vague, overly complex, or emotionally charged, they might not know how to reply.

5. **They’re Not as Invested in the Conversation**  
   Sometimes people are less interested in a conversation or don’t feel as close to the person messaging them.

6. **It’s Not About You**  
   People’s behavior often has more to do with their own lives, habits, or communication styles than with you personally.

---

### **How to Encourage Responses**
1. **Ask Clear, Specific Questions**  
   Instead of sending open-ended statements, ask direct questions that are easy to answer. For example, instead of saying, “How’s it going?” try, “What did you think of that movie we talked about?”

2. **Keep Messages Light and Engaging**  
   Avoid overly heavy or intense topics unless you know the person is comfortable with them. Keep the tone friendly and relatable.

3. **Be Patient**  
   Give people time to respond. If they’re busy, they might reply later. Sending follow-up messages too soon can come across as pushy.

4. **Match Their Communication Style**  
   Pay attention to how they communicate. If they prefer short, casual messages, adapt your style to match theirs.

5. **Build Stronger Relationships**  
   If you feel like people aren’t engaging with you, focus on building deeper connections. Spend time together in person or on calls, and show genuine interest in their lives.

6. **Don’t Take It Personally**  
   Remind yourself that people’s lack of response is often about their own circumstances, not about you. Try not to overthink it.

7. **Evaluate the Recipients**  
   If certain people consistently ignore your messages, it might be worth considering whether they’re the right people to invest your energy in. Focus on those who reciprocate your effort.

---

### **What to Do If It’s About You**
If you’re genuinely concerned that something about your communication style might be off-putting, consider the following:  
- Reflect on your tone: Are your messages friendly and respectful?  
- Avoid being overly negative, critical, or demanding in your messages.  
- Ask a trusted friend for honest feedback about how you come across in conversations.  

---

### **Final Thoughts**
It’s important to remember that you can’t control how others respond, but you can control how you communicate and who you choose to invest your time in. Focus on building relationships with people who value and appreciate you, and don’t let unanswered messages define your self-worth. You deserve to be heard and responded to—keep putting yourself out there, and you’ll find the right people who reciprocate your energy. 💛",0.5162901878356934
3505,"I think adult life is making him depressed and we often sleep in on weekends untill 1 or 2 pm. We just eat, smoke weed, watch movies, and he'll go on his phone all day. He doesn't seem motivated to do much and he's often angry.

 I have no clue how to help him take his mind off the negative, or to distract him into a different light. How do I help him?",How do you help yourself to believe you require more than what he offers to you?What do you get from this relationship which feels satisfying?To answer this question may in the longterm be the best way to help your bf.,"It sounds like you’re genuinely concerned about him, and that’s a great starting point. Helping someone who seems stuck in a cycle of negativity and lack of motivation can be challenging, but there are steps you can take to support him in a caring and constructive way. Here are some suggestions:

---

### 1. **Start with Open and Compassionate Communication**
   - Find a calm moment to talk to him about how he’s feeling. Avoid sounding judgmental or critical. Instead, express your concern and let him know you’re there for him.
   - Example: “I’ve noticed you seem a little down lately, and I just want to check in. How are you feeling? Is there anything on your mind you’d like to talk about?”

---

### 2. **Encourage Small, Positive Changes**
   - Suggest small, manageable activities that could help break the monotony. For example:
     - Go for a short walk together to get some fresh air and sunlight.
     - Try cooking a new recipe together instead of ordering takeout.
     - Engage in a creative activity like drawing, journaling, or playing music.
   - These small steps can help create a sense of accomplishment and shift his focus.

---

### 3. **Limit Substance Use**
   - While weed might provide temporary relief, it can also contribute to feelings of lethargy and low motivation. Gently suggest reducing or taking a break from smoking to see if it helps improve his mood and energy levels.

---

### 4. **Help Him Rediscover Interests or Hobbies**
   - Ask him if there’s anything he used to enjoy that he might want to revisit. It could be a sport, a creative outlet, or even a video game he used to love.
   - If he’s open to it, explore new hobbies together, like hiking, gardening, or joining a local class or group.

---

### 5. **Create a Routine**
   - A lack of structure can contribute to feelings of aimlessness. Help him establish a simple daily routine that includes time for self-care, physical activity, and something enjoyable.
   - Even small changes, like waking up a little earlier or setting aside time for a morning coffee, can make a difference.

---

### 6. **Encourage Professional Support**
   - If his feelings of depression or anger persist, gently suggest speaking to a therapist or counselor. Therapy can provide tools to manage negative emotions and help him work through underlying issues.
   - Example: “I know life can feel overwhelming sometimes, and talking to someone who’s trained to help might make a difference. Would you consider trying therapy?”

---

### 7. **Be Patient and Supportive**
   - Change takes time, and he may not be ready to make big shifts right away. Be patient and continue to offer your support without pressuring him.
   - Celebrate small wins and remind him that it’s okay to have tough days.

---

### 8. **Take Care of Yourself**
   - Supporting someone who’s struggling can be emotionally draining. Make sure you’re also taking time for self-care and seeking support if you need it.

---

### 9. **Consider Couples Activities**
   - If he’s open to it, try engaging in activities that bond you both, like volunteering, taking a class, or planning a weekend getaway. Shared experiences can help him feel more connected and motivated.

---

### 10. **Acknowledge Progress**
   - If he starts making small changes, acknowledge and encourage him. Positive reinforcement can help him feel more motivated to keep going.

30,"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","Absolutely not. It sounds like you have significant trauma and it will continue to impact your depression until it is dealt with. Everybody has issues, though some more traumatic than others yet it is best to just start somewhere. I would encourage you to begin counseling and work through some of your history at your own pace in order to begin to impact and reduce your depressive symptoms.","First, I want to acknowledge the strength and resilience it takes to share your story and consider seeking help. You’ve been through so much, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed. The good news is that counseling is designed to help people with complex and multifaceted challenges, and you don’t have to face these issues alone.

Here are a few things to consider:

1. **No, You Don’t Have Too Many Issues for Counseling**  
   Counselors are trained to work with people who have multiple, interconnected struggles. Your experiences—surviving sexual abuse, breast cancer, insomnia, depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem—are all areas that can be addressed in therapy. A skilled therapist will help you prioritize your concerns and work with you at a pace that feels manageable.

2. **Therapy Can Help You Untangle and Process**  
   While it might feel like there’s a lot to address, therapy can help you untangle these issues and explore how they’re connected. For example, your history of sexual abuse and cancer survivorship might contribute to your depression, anxiety, or self-esteem challenges. A therapist can help you process these experiences and develop coping strategies.

3. **You Don’t Have to Tackle Everything at Once**  
   Therapy is a journey, and it’s okay to focus on one issue at a time. You and your therapist can work together to identify what feels most pressing or impactful right now. Over time, you can address other areas as you feel ready.

4. **Therapy Can Build on Your Strengths**  
   You’ve already shown incredible resilience by surviving and thriving despite these challenges. Your long, happy marriage is also a testament to your capacity for connection and love. Therapy can help you build on these strengths and develop tools to navigate the areas where you’re struggling.

5. **Finding the Right Therapist is Key**  
   Look for a therapist who has experience with trauma, chronic illness, and mental health challenges. Many therapists specialize in working with survivors of sexual abuse, cancer survivors, or individuals with depression and anxiety. You might consider asking about their approach to ensure it feels like a good fit for you.

6. **Starting Therapy is a Brave Step**  
   It’s never too late to seek support. Therapy can provide a safe space to process your experiences, heal, and grow. Remember, you don’t have to have all the answers or know where to start—your therapist will guide you.

You’ve already taken a courageous step by considering counseling. You deserve support, understanding, and the opportunity to heal. You’re not alone, and there is hope for feeling better.",0.5404544472694397
179,"I'm in my late teens and live with my dad. The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I won't want to talk to them for days or even weeks.    Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.
   Are they right, am I depressed?","I'm alway wary of assigning a term to a feeling, as often that term becomes more important than the feeling itself. From the very little that you have written, it is clear that you are going through something that has made you extremely low, affected your self-esteem and motivation, limits your enjoyment of formerly pleasurable activities and affects your feelings of self-worth. All of these are aspects of being depressed, though you can be depressed and still not have ""depression"". Counseling is definitely a place where you can go and sort out why you have had such a sudden a drastic change to your mood. Sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine, losses or significant disappointments. Talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way, but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the future. I do hope that you will reach out. Feeling alone can be harmful over long periods of time, as it can stop us from seeking out the support we need.","It’s understandable that you’re feeling this way, and it’s important to take your emotions seriously. What you’re describing—feeling unmotivated to socialize, questioning your self-worth, and feeling like you’re not doing anything right—could be signs of depression, but it could also be related to other factors like stress, anxiety, or simply navigating the challenges of being in your late teens. 

Here are a few things to consider:

1. **Social Withdrawal**: It’s normal to want some alone time, but if you’re consistently avoiding friends or activities you used to enjoy, it could be a sign that something deeper is going on.

2. **Self-Worth**: Feeling like you’re not worth knowing or that you’ll never do anything right can be a symptom of low self-esteem or depression. These thoughts can be very isolating and overwhelming.

3. **Mood Changes**: If you’re feeling persistently sad, empty, or hopeless, it’s worth exploring whether depression might be a factor.

4. **Life Transitions**: Being in your late teens can be a challenging time. You’re navigating college, relationships, and figuring out who you are. It’s normal to feel uncertain or overwhelmed at times.

### What You Can Do:
- **Talk to Someone**: Consider sharing your feelings with someone you trust, like a close friend, family member, or counselor. Sometimes just talking about what you’re going through can help.
- **Self-Care**: Try to take care of your physical and mental health. This includes eating well, getting enough sleep, and engaging in activities that bring you joy or relaxation.
- **Professional Help**: If these feelings persist or worsen, it might be helpful to speak with a mental health professional. They can help you understand what you’re experiencing and provide support or treatment if needed.
- **Small Steps**: If socializing feels overwhelming, try connecting with friends in small, manageable ways, like sending a text or meeting for a short coffee date.

### Remember:
You’re not alone in feeling this way, and there’s no shame in seeking help. Many people experience similar feelings at some point in their lives, and reaching out for support is a sign of strength, not weakness. You are worth knowing, and you are capable of doing things right—even if it doesn’t always feel that way.",0.44397586584091187
1921,"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?","This is a great question. Finding the right therapist can be tricky because you don't really know how someone will be like until you meet them. A few ways to prescreen are to:- Visit the therapist's website, psychologytoday profile, social media, etc...- Have a phone call with the therapist prior to your first appointmentOnce you meet your therapist it is important to be clear with your wishes and expectations. We are trained in helping you thrive in your life but we cannot mind read so if you don't tell us, we won't know. Don't be shy about what you like and what you don't like. A good therapist will listen to your needs, process them with you, and create a customized plan that works for you and your life. A good therapist will also not take anything you say (even criticism) personally. Coming to therapy is hard and often times you might not want to go. What makes a good therapist is someone who understands this and tries to make you feel as comfortable as possible while you address uncomfortable topics.","Finding the right therapist is a deeply personal process, and it’s important to feel comfortable, understood, and supported in your therapeutic relationship. Here are some ways to determine if your therapist is a good fit for you, as well as tips on how to communicate your needs effectively:

---

### **How to Know if Your Therapist is Right for You**

   - They “get” you and respect your perspective, even if they challenge you at times.

2. **You Feel Safe and Comfortable**  
   - You can be open and honest without fear of judgment.  
   - The environment feels supportive, and you trust them with your vulnerabilities.

3. **They Align with Your Goals**  
   - Your therapist understands your goals for therapy and works with you to achieve them.  
   - They explain their approach and how it might help you.

4. **They Respect Your Boundaries**  
   - They don’t push you too hard or too fast but respect your pace.  
   - They’re open to feedback and adjust their style when needed.

5. **You Notice Progress**  
   - Over time, you feel like you’re gaining insights, learning new skills, or making positive changes.  
   - Even if progress is slow, you feel hopeful about the process.

6. **Their Style Works for You**  
   - Their therapeutic approach (e.g., CBT, psychodynamic, trauma-informed) resonates with you.  
   - Their personality and communication style feel compatible with yours.

---

### **How to “Train” Your Therapist to Meet Your Needs**
Therapy is a collaborative process, and it’s okay to guide your therapist to better support you. Here’s how:

1. **Be Clear About Your Goals**  
   - At the start of therapy, share what you hope to achieve (e.g., managing anxiety, improving relationships, processing trauma).  
   - If your goals change, let them know.

2. **Give Feedback**  
   - If something isn’t working for you, tell them. For example:  
     - “I feel like we’re focusing too much on [X] when I really want to work on [Y].”  
     - “I’m not sure how [technique] is helping me—can we try something else?”  
   - Most therapists appreciate constructive feedback and will adjust their approach.

3. **Ask Questions**  
   - If you’re unsure about their methods or why they’re suggesting something, ask!  
   - For example: “Can you explain how this technique will help me?” or “What’s the purpose of this exercise?”

4. **Share Your Preferences**  
   - Let them know how you like to work. For example:  
     - “I prefer practical tools over deep exploration.”  
     - “I need more structure in our sessions.”  
     - “I’d like to focus on the present rather than the past.”

5. **Be Honest About Your Experience**  
   - If you’re feeling stuck, disconnected, or misunderstood, let them know.  
   - A good therapist will want to address this and make changes to better support you.

6. **Advocate for Your Needs**  
   - If you feel like your therapist isn’t meeting your needs, it’s okay to discuss it or even consider finding someone else.  
   - Therapy is for you, and you deserve someone who aligns with your needs.

### **When to Consider a Different Therapist**
If you’ve tried to communicate your needs but still feel unsupported, unheard, or stagnant, it might be time to look for a new therapist. Signs include:  
- You don’t feel safe or respected.  
- Their approach doesn’t resonate with you, and they’re unwilling to adapt.  
- You’re not making progress, and they’re not addressing your concerns.

346,"Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  Am I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal.","You need to find an outlet. Someone to talk to. Your dad or someone who loves your mother as well is someone ideal. But anyone could help. Just look to someone for help. If you can't find anyone who you think will listen, talk to your mom. It can help greatly just to get the words out. Tell her how you feel about her passing, but then also about everything else. Talk to her about your day. Tell her about happy things. I don't know if you're a religious person, or where you believe she is now, but no matter what you can talk to her.","You’re not crazy, and your thoughts are more common than you might think. Many people grapple with existential questions and the concept of eternity, especially when it comes to life after death. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed or anxious when contemplating something as vast and incomprehensible as infinity.

Here are a few things to consider:

1. **It’s Normal to Question Eternity**: The idea of living forever can be daunting because it’s beyond our human experience. Our lives are finite, so the concept of eternity can feel alien and even unsettling. You’re not alone in feeling this way.

2. **Anxiety and Existential Thoughts**: Anxiety often latches onto things that are uncertain or beyond our control. The unknown nature of what happens after death can trigger this kind of anxiety. It’s not unusual for these thoughts to spiral into panic, but they don’t define you or your mental health.

3. **Religious Teachings and Personal Beliefs**: If the religious teachings you were raised with are causing distress, it’s okay to explore and question them. Many people find comfort in reinterpreting or redefining their beliefs in a way that feels more manageable and less overwhelming.

4. **Focus on the Present**: When thoughts about eternity become overwhelming, grounding yourself in the present moment can help. Mindfulness techniques, deep breathing, or engaging in activities you enjoy can redirect your focus and ease anxiety.

5. **Talk to Someone**: If these thoughts are causing significant distress, consider talking to a trusted friend, counselor, or therapist. They can help you process your feelings and develop strategies to manage anxiety.

6. **You’re Not Alone**: Many people wrestle with these questions, and there’s no “right” or “wrong” way to feel about them. It’s okay to not have all the answers, and it’s okay to feel uncertain.

Remember, your feelings are valid, and you’re not alone in grappling with these big questions. Be kind to yourself as you navigate these thoughts, and seek support if you need it.",0.4654105305671692
1953,"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","Yes, it is very normal to cry during a therapy appointment.  When you meet with a counselor, you are opening yourself up and sharing very vulnerable sides of yourself.  Through this deep introspection, emotions (sometimes unexpected) can come out and this is completely okay and very healthy.  Research has shown that crying reduces pain by releasing oxytocin and endorphins and reduces stress through the release of stress reduction hormones.","It is completely normal for people to cry during therapy, and you are definitely not alone in this experience. Therapy is a safe space where individuals often explore deep emotions, unresolved issues, and vulnerabilities. Crying is a natural and healthy emotional response to processing difficult feelings, memories, or experiences. It can be a sign of release, healing, and progress in your therapeutic journey.

Many people cry in therapy because it’s one of the few places where they feel truly heard, understood, and free to express their emotions without judgment. Therapists are trained to support clients through these moments and often see crying as a meaningful part of the therapeutic process.

If you feel self-conscious about crying, remember that it’s a sign of courage and willingness to engage with your emotions. Your therapist is there to support you, not to judge you. It’s okay to let your emotions flow—it’s part of the healing process.",0.5766414999961853
2661,"My friend is abusing her prescription medicine. Even though she told me she didn't have any more pills, I found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications.","Your good intentions to help your friend stay clean, are very caring about her.Unless your friend feels like stopping pills,  taking them away will mean she finds them some place else.The problem that anyone who is addicted to pills has, is that the person is psychologically and at least with xanax, physically addicted.Taking pills has basically become a standard part of your friend's life.Her problem is bigger than your ability to care.If you haven't already done so, tell your friend directly about your opinion on the way she is using pills.This is not a guarantee that she'll stop.It isa way of you showing that you care about her.Offering love and advice are the only things you can do for her.Meanwhile, knowing she is hurting herself is probably hurting you.Be sure to keep a sense of balance within yourself.  Offer your concern and know she is the one who must decide to stop using.","I'm really sorry to hear that your friend is going through this, and it’s clear you care about her well-being. Prescription medication abuse is a serious issue that can have significant physical, emotional, and mental health consequences. Here are some steps you can take to support her:

### 1. **Approach Her with Care and Concern**
   - Choose a private, calm moment to talk to her. Avoid being confrontational or judgmental.
   - Use ""I"" statements to express your concern, like, *""I’m really worried about you because I care about your health and well-being.""*
   - Let her know you’re coming from a place of love and support, not criticism.

### 2. **Encourage Honesty**
   - Gently bring up what you’ve noticed, such as the prescriptions you found, and ask if she’s comfortable talking about it.
   - If she denies it or gets defensive, don’t push too hard. Let her know you’re there for her whenever she’s ready to talk.

### 3. **Educate Yourself**
   - Learn about the specific medication she’s using and the risks of misuse. This will help you understand what she’s going through and how to support her.

### 4. **Encourage Professional Help**
   - Suggest she talk to her doctor or a mental health professional about her medication use. They can help her safely manage her prescriptions or explore alternative treatments.
   - If she’s open to it, offer to help her find resources or accompany her to an appointment.

### 5. **Be Supportive, Not Enabling**
   - While it’s important to be compassionate, avoid enabling her behavior (e.g., giving her money or covering for her).
   - Let her know that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.

### 6. **Take Care of Yourself**
   - Supporting someone with an addiction can be emotionally draining. Make sure you’re also taking care of your own mental health.
   - Consider reaching out to a support group or counselor for guidance on how to help your friend while maintaining your own well-being.

### 7. **Know When to Seek Help**
   - If her behavior becomes dangerous or life-threatening (e.g., overdose, severe withdrawal symptoms), don’t hesitate to seek emergency help.
   - If she refuses to acknowledge the problem or get help, you may need to involve trusted family members or professionals to intervene.

Remember, you can’t force someone to change, but your support and concern can make a big difference. Let her know she’s not alone and that help is available.",0.45896583795547485
1146,"When my boyfriend gets in a snit, he gives me the silent treatment for days. When I ask what is wrong, I get nothing: no reply, no phone call. If he does reply, it is something very sarcastic and hurtful. He never admits he is wrong and never apologizes.","You are in an abusive relationship-not because of your boyfriend's silences but because he is comfortable being sarcastic and hurtful, never admits he is wrong and never apologizes. It is your choice to participate in an abusive relationship. You can not stop an abusive partner from being abusive no matter how wonderfully you treat your partner. You can either accept the terrible relationship as it is or reach out for the support that you need to leave the abusive relationship. I wish you well, always.","It sounds like you're dealing with a very challenging and emotionally taxing situation. The silent treatment, sarcastic remarks, and lack of accountability can be deeply hurtful and damaging to a relationship. Here are some thoughts and suggestions that might help you navigate this:

### 1. **Understand the Silent Treatment**
   - The silent treatment is often a form of emotional manipulation or control. It can leave you feeling isolated, anxious, and unsure of where you stand. It’s important to recognize that this behavior is not healthy communication.

### 2. **Set Boundaries**
   - Let your boyfriend know that the silent treatment is not acceptable to you. Calmly express how it makes you feel and that you’re willing to talk things through when he’s ready, but you won’t tolerate being ignored or treated poorly. Boundaries are essential for maintaining self-respect and emotional well-being.

### 3. **Communicate When Calm**
   - When he’s not in a snit, have a calm and honest conversation about how his behavior affects you. Use “I” statements, such as “I feel hurt when you give me the silent treatment because it makes me feel like my feelings don’t matter.”

### 4. **Encourage Healthy Conflict Resolution**
   - Suggest healthier ways to handle disagreements, such as taking a short break to cool off before discussing the issue, or writing down thoughts if verbal communication is difficult. A relationship thrives when both partners can resolve conflicts constructively.

### 5. **Evaluate the Relationship**
   - Reflect on whether this behavior is a pattern and how it impacts your overall happiness. A healthy relationship should be built on mutual respect, open communication, and the ability to apologize and grow together. If he consistently refuses to take responsibility for his actions or work on the relationship, it may be a sign of deeper issues.

### 6. **Consider Professional Help**
   - If your boyfriend is open to it, couples counseling could be a helpful way to address communication issues and improve the relationship. If he’s unwilling to seek help, you might consider individual therapy to process your feelings and gain clarity on what you want and need in a relationship.

### 7. **Prioritize Your Well-Being**
   - It’s important to take care of yourself emotionally. Surround yourself with supportive friends or family, engage in activities that bring you joy, and remind yourself that you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect.

### 8. **Know When to Walk Away**
   - If the behavior continues despite your efforts to address it, it may be a sign that the relationship is not healthy for you. Staying in a relationship where you’re consistently disrespected or ignored can take a toll on your self-esteem and mental health. It’s okay to prioritize your own well-being and walk away if necessary.

Remember, you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel valued, heard, and respected. If your boyfriend is unwilling to change or acknowledge the impact of his behavior, it may be time to reevaluate whether this relationship is meeting your needs.",0.5139983296394348
869,"My ex-fiancé (whom I am still seeing) left me because of the pressure from all three of his teenage daughters. They wanted him to try to work it out with their mom (his ex-girlfriend of 20 years). He and I split three months ago, but I have been seeing him pretty regularly despite the fact that he is living back with his ex-girlfriend and kids. He is ""co-existing"" for the kids and fighting all the time with his ex-girlfriend. His daughters don’t want their dad with me because my two boys (grown adults and on their own now) had bad reputations and issues with drugs. His daughters say it is embarrassing for him to be with me. He and I had an absolutely amazing relationship and connect on so many levels. He is getting a lot of pressure from his family and his longtime friends to ""do the right thing"" and stay with his ex-girlfriend for the kids. He says he wants me to wait. We were going get married last year. He bought me a $1000 dress, we had invitations made, and everything set up, but then his girls told him they'd never speak to him again if he married me. He says he’s trying to mend his relationship with them.","Hello. It seems you are in a set of circumstances that are highly uncomfortable for you. Do you feel those circumstances are healthy? Do you find pleasure being in such a place of uncertainty? Why do you continue to be in this situation? Without meaning to appear that I might be lacking in compassion, you do have the option to leave the connection completely if the harm it is doing is more that the pleasure it brings you. Is there a benefit to being in this relationship? Do you consider this situation to be for your highest good? Is it healthy to be involved in something that is not likely healthy or perhaps could even be seen as dysfunctional? In truth, only you can decide the answers to these very important questions. I would encourage you to think of who benefits by being in this situation, and how you might be able to find happiness in other relationships that are healthier and more positive. In my clinical view based on what I read, this particular relationship does not carry the joy I am sure you want, nor the healthy interactions you would expect in a functional romantic engagement with another person.Beating yourself up about potentially wasting all this time waiting for the other person to come around will not serve a positive purpose. It likely will only lower your self-esteem. There is a time to wait to see how things develop, and a time to move on to other experiences. You are the one to make that choice, but I would encourage you to connect with your inner higher self, for the most clear answer. Chances are, you already know the answer, you just need to embrace it. Getting in touch with a counselor in your area can also help ferret out some of the deeper issues that you might not have felt comfortable expressing here.","I’m so sorry you’re going through this—it sounds like an incredibly painful and complicated situation. You’re clearly deeply invested in this relationship, and it’s understandable to feel torn and hurt by the circumstances. Here are some thoughts and considerations that might help you navigate this:

### 1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**
   - It’s okay to feel hurt, confused, and even angry. This situation involves a lot of emotional layers, and it’s important to give yourself space to process your feelings.
   - You’ve invested a lot in this relationship, and it’s natural to feel a sense of loss or betrayal, even if you’re still seeing him.

### 2. **Evaluate His Actions**
   - While he may say he wants you to wait, his actions show that he’s prioritizing his relationship with his daughters and his ex-girlfriend. This doesn’t necessarily mean he doesn’t care for you, but it does indicate where his current priorities lie.
   - Consider whether his actions align with his words. Is he actively working toward a resolution, or is he stuck in a cycle of indecision?

### 3. **Set Boundaries for Yourself**
   - It’s important to protect your own emotional well-being. Continuing to see him while he’s living with his ex and trying to mend relationships with his daughters may be prolonging your pain.
   - Think about what you need and deserve in a relationship. Are you willing to wait indefinitely, or do you need clarity and commitment?

### 4. **Consider the Long-Term Reality**
   - Even if he does choose to be with you, his daughters’ disapproval and the ongoing tension with his ex-girlfriend could create significant challenges in your relationship.
   - Think about whether you’re prepared to navigate these complexities and whether this relationship can truly thrive in the face of such resistance.

### 5. **Communicate Honestly**
   - Have an open and honest conversation with him about your needs, expectations, and timeline. Ask him to be clear about his intentions and what he’s willing to do to make your relationship work.
   - Be prepared to hear things that might be difficult, but clarity is essential for making decisions about your future.

### 6. **Focus on Your Own Happiness**
   - While it’s clear that you love him, it’s important to prioritize your own happiness and well-being. Consider whether this relationship is bringing you joy or causing more pain than it’s worth.
   - Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who can help you through this difficult time.

### 7. **Consider Professional Support**
   - If you’re struggling to process your emotions or make decisions, talking to a therapist or counselor can provide valuable guidance and perspective.

Ultimately, you deserve a relationship where you feel valued, respected, and secure. While it’s clear that you and your ex-fiancé have a strong connection, the current circumstances may not be conducive to a healthy and fulfilling partnership. Take the time to reflect on what you truly want and need, and make decisions that align with your own well-being.",0.44579213857650757
1915,"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?","Finding the right therapist can be difficult, especially if you've never tried it before. Things to consider are location, availability and what specifically are you looking for. Some practitioners specifically only work with a certain type of issue (i.e eating disorders, adolescents, anger management, life transitions, anxiety...etc) and others can work with a variety of concerns. As far as training your therapist, you can't. You simply let them know what you are looking to work on or what you think may be an issue for you. Depending on the way they practice(their style of working with clients) is how they will then decide to make a treatment plan that works best for you. You can always ask them their specialty practice population, the problems they generally help others with and what type of mental health provider they are (Psychologist, social worker, licensed mental health counselor).","Finding the right therapist and ensuring they meet your needs is a crucial part of the therapeutic process. Here are some steps and considerations to help you determine if your therapist is the right fit for you and how to communicate your needs effectively:

---

### **How to Know if You Have the Right Therapist**
1. **Comfort and Trust**:
   - Do you feel safe and comfortable sharing your thoughts and feelings with them?
   - Do you trust them to handle your concerns with care and professionalism?

2. **Alignment with Your Goals**:
   - Do they understand your goals for therapy and align with them?
   - Are they helping you make progress toward those goals?

3. **Communication Style**:
   - Do they listen actively and respond in a way that feels helpful?
   - Do they explain their approach and reasoning in a way that makes sense to you?

4. **Expertise and Approach**:
   - Do they have experience or training in the specific issues you’re addressing (e.g., trauma, anxiety, relationships)?
   - Is their therapeutic approach (e.g., CBT, psychodynamic, humanistic) compatible with your preferences?

5. **Feedback and Adaptability**:
   - Are they open to feedback and willing to adjust their approach if something isn’t working for you?
   - Do they take your concerns seriously and collaborate with you on solutions?

6. **Cultural Sensitivity**:
   - Do they respect and understand your cultural, religious, or personal background?
   - Do they create a nonjudgmental space for you to express yourself?

7. **Progress and Insight**:
   - Do you feel like you’re gaining new insights or developing coping skills?
   - Are you noticing positive changes in your life or mindset?

---

### **How to ""Train"" Your Therapist to Meet Your Needs**
1. **Be Clear About Your Goals**:
   - At the start of therapy, communicate what you hope to achieve. For example, ""I want to work on managing my anxiety"" or ""I need help processing past trauma.""

2. **Provide Feedback**:
   - If something isn’t working, let them know. For example, ""I don’t find homework assignments helpful—can we try something else?"" or ""I’d like to focus more on my relationships than my past.""

3. **Ask Questions**:
   - If you’re unsure about their approach, ask them to explain it. For example, ""Can you tell me how this technique will help me?"" or ""What’s the goal of this exercise?""

4. **Share Your Preferences**:
   - Let them know what works best for you. For example, ""I prefer direct feedback over open-ended questions"" or ""I need more structure in our sessions.""

5. **Collaborate on the Process**:
   - Therapy is a partnership. Share your thoughts on what’s helpful and what’s not, and work together to adjust the approach.

6. **Advocate for Yourself**:
   - If you feel your needs aren’t being met, don’t hesitate to bring it up. For example, ""I feel like we’re not addressing my main concerns—can we shift focus?""

7. **Be Honest About Your Experience**:
   - If you’re not feeling a connection or progress, discuss it openly. A good therapist will appreciate your honesty and work with you to improve the process.

### **When to Consider a Change**
If, despite your efforts to communicate and collaborate, you still feel unheard, misunderstood, or stagnant, it may be time to consider finding a new therapist. The right therapist will respect your needs and work with you to create a supportive and effective therapeutic relationship.

I've tried various therapists and pills, but nothing's helped.","Is it possible you simply didn't mix well with the particular therapists with whom you've worked?   If this is possible, interview a therapist before  starting therapy.   Then you will be choosing a therapist who feels compatible with your way of seeing yourself and your life.Also, therapy isn't for everyone.Read about the different healing modalities and see if one of these speaks to your interest in feeling better.What matters most is finding among all the legitimate healing methods, what you believe will be effective.","I'm so sorry you're feeling this way. Dealing with anxiety and depression can feel overwhelming, especially when it feels like nothing is working. Please know you're not alone, and there are still options and paths to explore. Here are some thoughts that might help:

---

### 1. **Reevaluate Your Treatment Plan**
   - **Therapy:** If traditional therapy hasn’t worked, consider exploring different modalities like:
     - **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**  
     - **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)**  
     - **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)**  
     - **EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)** for trauma  
   - **Medication:** If pills haven’t helped, it could be worth discussing alternative medications or combinations with a psychiatrist. Genetic testing (like GeneSight) can sometimes help identify which medications might work best for you.

---

### 2. **Explore Holistic Approaches**
   - **Lifestyle Changes:** Small, consistent changes can make a big difference over time:  
     - Regular exercise (even a short walk)  
     - A balanced diet (gut health is linked to mental health)  
     - Prioritizing sleep  
   - **Mindfulness and Meditation:** Apps like Calm, Headspace, or Insight Timer can guide you.  
   - **Yoga or Tai Chi:** These combine movement with mindfulness and can reduce anxiety.  
   - **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts can help process emotions.  

---

### 3. **Consider Alternative Treatments**
   - **Ketamine Therapy:** For treatment-resistant depression, ketamine infusions or nasal sprays (like Spravato) have shown promise.  
   - **TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation):** A non-invasive treatment for depression.  
   - **Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy:** Research on substances like psilocybin (under professional guidance) is showing potential for depression and anxiety.  
   - **Acupuncture:** Some people find relief through traditional Chinese medicine.  

---

### 4. **Build a Support System**
   - **Connect with Others:** Isolation can worsen depression. Reach out to trusted friends, family, or support groups (in-person or online).  
   - **Peer Support:** Organizations like NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) offer support groups and resources.  
   - **Crisis Support:** If you’re in immediate distress, reach out to a crisis hotline like 988 (in the U.S.) or a local helpline.  

---

### 5. **Be Kind to Yourself**
   - Healing is not linear, and it’s okay to have setbacks. Celebrate small wins, even if it’s just getting out of bed or taking a shower.  
   - Remind yourself that your worth is not defined by your mental health struggles.  

---

### 6. **Consider a Second Opinion**
   - If you feel stuck, it might be helpful to seek a second opinion from a different psychiatrist or therapist. Sometimes a fresh perspective can make all the difference.  

---

### 7. **Emergency Help**
   - If you’re experiencing suicidal thoughts or feel like you can’t cope, please seek immediate help. Call 911, go to the nearest emergency room, or contact a crisis hotline. You matter, and there are people who want to support you.

2716,"I feel angry, anxious, and depressed. The PTSD I suffer is from a past relationship.","If the symptoms are to the extent that they are affecting your ability to function, you may want to consider seeking treatment. PTSD, anxiety, and depression all typically respond well to treatment if provided by a trained clinician. Common types of treatment for PTSD that you may want to look into include Cognitive Processing Therapy or EMDR. The nice things about Cognitive Processing Therapy is that it is time limited and only lasts 17 sessions typically. ","I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. Dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic relationship can be incredibly overwhelming, and it’s completely valid to feel angry, anxious, and depressed as you process what happened. PTSD from a past relationship can deeply affect your sense of safety, self-worth, and ability to trust, and it’s important to acknowledge that healing is a journey that takes time and support.

Here are some steps that might help you navigate these feelings:

### 1. **Acknowledge Your Emotions**
   - It’s okay to feel angry, anxious, or depressed. These emotions are a natural response to trauma. Try to validate your feelings without judgment. You’ve been through something difficult, and it’s okay to not be okay.

### 2. **Reach Out for Support**
   - You don’t have to go through this alone. Consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist who can provide a safe space for you to express your feelings. A therapist, especially one trained in trauma or PTSD, can help you process your experiences and develop coping strategies.

### 3. **Practice Self-Compassion**
   - Be gentle with yourself. Healing from trauma is not linear, and it’s okay to have setbacks. Remind yourself that you’re doing the best you can in a challenging situation.

### 4. **Grounding Techniques**
   - When you feel overwhelmed by anxiety or flashbacks, grounding techniques can help bring you back to the present moment. For example:
     - Focus on your breath: Take slow, deep breaths.
     - Use your senses: Notice five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste.
     - Hold onto something comforting, like a soft blanket or a warm cup of tea.

### 5. **Set Boundaries**
   - If contact with your past partner or reminders of the relationship are triggering, it’s okay to set boundaries. This might mean limiting or cutting off contact, unfollowing them on social media, or avoiding places that remind you of them.

### 6. **Engage in Self-Care**
   - Prioritize activities that help you feel safe and nurtured. This could be anything from taking a walk in nature, journaling, practicing yoga, or listening to calming music. Small acts of self-care can make a big difference.

### 7. **Educate Yourself About PTSD**
   - Understanding how PTSD works can help you feel less alone and more in control. There are many resources, books, and online communities that can provide insight and support.

### 8. **Consider Professional Help**
   - If your symptoms feel unmanageable or are interfering with your daily life, reaching out to a mental health professional is a powerful step. Therapies like EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) or trauma-focused CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) are often effective for PTSD.

### 9. **Be Patient with Your Healing**
   - Healing from trauma takes time, and it’s okay to move at your own pace. Celebrate small victories, like moments of calm or progress in therapy, and remind yourself that you’re working toward a healthier, happier future.

### 10. **You Are Not Defined by Your Trauma**
   - While the trauma may feel like a big part of your life right now, it doesn’t define who you are. You are resilient, and with time and support, you can reclaim your sense of self and move forward.

1514,"I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with. It was brief and turned into us being just good friends.
   I spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend. Was i wrong?","Depends on your definition of ""wrong"" on this one. Was it objectively wrong to spend the weekend with a good friend, who also happens to be an ex? Probably not. But, it upset your current boyfriend, and he is entitled to his feelings if you are in a relationship with him. He may be out of line if he assumes that anything happened between you and your ex that would compromise the relationship, however your boyfriend being upset might also mean that he wanted to spend that kind of weekend with you and did not get to do that.Long story short, it might help your relationship to understand more, and be curious, not judge-y, around what is upsetting for him. Perhaps having empathy for his experience of the behavior could help him to feel more secure with you having relationships with your ex(es).","It’s understandable that your boyfriend might feel upset, especially if he’s unsure about the dynamics of your friendship with your ex. Whether or not you were ""wrong"" depends on the context and how you handled the situation. Here are some things to consider:

1. **Communication with Your Boyfriend**: Did you let your boyfriend know in advance that you were spending the weekend with your ex? Open and honest communication is key in any relationship. If your boyfriend felt blindsided or excluded, that could explain his reaction.

2. **Boundaries in Your Friendship**: Spending time with an ex can be tricky, even if you’re just friends. It’s important to ensure that both you and your ex have clear boundaries and that your actions don’t unintentionally send mixed signals to your current boyfriend.

3. **Your Boyfriend’s Feelings**: It’s important to acknowledge and validate your boyfriend’s feelings. Even if your intentions were innocent, he might feel insecure or uncomfortable about the situation. Discussing his concerns calmly and reassuring him of your commitment to your relationship can help.

4. **Your Intentions**: Reflect on why you spent the weekend with your ex. Was it purely platonic? Did you consider how it might affect your current relationship? Being honest with yourself about your intentions can help you navigate the situation more thoughtfully.

In the future, it might be helpful to set clear boundaries and involve your boyfriend in decisions that could affect your relationship. For now, focus on having an open and understanding conversation with him to address his concerns and rebuild trust.",0.5276442170143127

What can I do to change this?","You are describing a very legitimate reaction to trauma.  Rape is an aweful experience and I am very sorry that happened to you.  When horrible things happen, people often react in a way that interferes with the ability to live a normal life and function the way they did in the past.  This is very common and the goal is to help you manage the stress caused by dealing with negative events and with help you can regain emotional well-being.  This is especially important if you have had more than one negative thing happen.  Oftentimes, the unconscious reaction is to become numb and avoid all feelings, especially if more than one negative event occurred.  A big part of what causes people trouble are feelings of guilt.  We often blame ourselves when bad things happen. It is actually difficult to comprehend the concept that we don't always have control of what happens in life.  In addition, when you mentioned feeling like a sociopath, it sounded like you feel like your reaction is wrong.  The first thing you can do is realize that your feelings and reactions are o.k., you aren't doing anything wrong, and nothing is wrong with you.  The next step is to start dealing with the impact of these traumatic experiences. Identifying your feelings, and knowing the thoughts and beliefs that are behind those emotions can help you regain your sense of happiness.  Research shows that understanding and expressing those thoughts and feelings can help.  If doesn't sound like you need to do anything to change yourself, but talking to a counselor can be helpful in managing your reaction to a incredibly traumatic experience.  I hope this helps you understand your feelings and can get to a place where you enjoy life.","I'm so sorry that you've experienced such a traumatic event, and I want to acknowledge the immense pain and difficulty you must be going through. What you're describing—feeling numb or disconnected from your emotions—is a common response to trauma. It’s your mind’s way of protecting you from overwhelming feelings. However, it’s important to find ways to reconnect with your emotions and begin the healing process. Here are some steps you can take:

### 1. **Seek Professional Support**
   - **Therapy:** A trauma-informed therapist, especially one trained in modalities like EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), or somatic therapy, can help you process your emotions in a safe and supportive environment.
   - **Support Groups:** Connecting with others who have experienced similar trauma can help you feel less alone and provide a space to share and heal.

### 2. **Practice Self-Compassion**
   - Be gentle with yourself. Healing is not linear, and it’s okay to feel numb or disconnected right now. Remind yourself that this is a protective response and not a permanent state.

### 3. **Reconnect with Your Body**
   - Trauma can cause a disconnection between your mind and body. Practices like yoga, mindfulness, or grounding exercises can help you reconnect with your physical sensations and emotions.
   - Try simple grounding techniques, such as focusing on your breath, noticing the sensations in your body, or describing objects around you to bring yourself into the present moment.

### 4. **Express Yourself Creatively**
   - Journaling, drawing, painting, or other forms of creative expression can help you access and process emotions that feel buried or inaccessible.

### 5. **Engage in Activities That Bring Comfort**
   - Even if you don’t feel joy or pleasure right now, engaging in activities that used to bring you comfort or peace (like listening to music, spending time in nature, or being with loved ones) can help you slowly reconnect with positive emotions.

### 6. **Be Patient with Your Emotions**
   - Emotions may return gradually, and they might feel overwhelming at first. Allow yourself to feel them without judgment, and remind yourself that it’s okay to cry, feel anger, or experience sadness.

### 7. **Consider Medication (if needed)**
   - If you’re struggling with severe depression, anxiety, or dissociation, a psychiatrist may recommend medication to help stabilize your mood and support your healing process.

### 8. **Build a Support System**
   - Surround yourself with people who care about you and can provide emotional support. Let trusted friends or family members know how you’re feeling, even if it’s hard to open up.

### 9. **Educate Yourself About Trauma**
   - Understanding the effects of trauma can help you feel less alone and more empowered. Books like *The Body Keeps the Score* by Bessel van der Kolk or *Trauma and Recovery* by Judith Herman can be helpful resources.

### 10. **Be Kind to Yourself**
   - Healing from trauma takes time, and there’s no “right” way to do it. Celebrate small victories, like acknowledging a feeling or reaching out for help, and remind yourself that you’re doing the best you can.

If you’re ever feeling overwhelmed or unsafe, please reach out to a crisis hotline or trusted professional immediately. You don’t have to go through this alone, and there are people who care deeply about your well-being. You are deserving of support, healing, and a future where you can feel whole again.",0.4361252784729004

 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?",If you connect with your therapist and can say whatever you want to say and not be judged.,"Finding the right therapist and ensuring they meet your needs is a crucial part of the therapeutic process.

   - They explain their approach and reasoning clearly.

### **How to ""Train"" Your Therapist to Meet Your Needs**
1. **Be Clear About Your Goals**  
   - Share what you hope to achieve in therapy (e.g., managing anxiety, improving relationships, processing trauma).  
   - Be specific about what’s working and what’s not.

2. **Provide Feedback**  
   - Let them know if something they’re doing feels unhelpful or uncomfortable.  
   - For example: “I’m not sure this approach is working for me. Can we try something else?”

   - Example: “I think I’d benefit from more practical tools to manage my stress.”

5. **Be Honest About Your Experience**  
   - If something isn’t resonating, say so. Therapists rely on your feedback to adjust their approach.  
   - Example: “I don’t feel like we’re addressing the root of my issue. Can we focus more on that?”

6. **Collaborate on the Process**  
   - Therapy is a partnership. Work together to tailor the sessions to your needs.  
   - Example: “I’d like to spend more time on this topic. Can we explore it further?”

7. **Give It Time, but Trust Your Instincts**  
   - Building rapport and seeing progress can take time, but if something feels consistently off, it’s okay to consider finding a new therapist.

### **When to Consider a Change**
If, despite your efforts, you feel misunderstood, dismissed, or stagnant, it might be time to explore other options. A good therapist will respect your decision and may even help you find someone better suited to your needs.

2775,"I am not sure if I am depressed. I don't know how to bring it up to my parents, and that makes me miserable.","Depending on your relationship with your parents, inviting them to have a conversation might be a good first step.  If they consent then you can have the opportunity to discuss your concerns with them.  Inviting someone to a conversation and getting their agreement is a great first step. I would then make sure your location of the discussion is conducive to the conversation and once all that is considered it might be beneficial that you make a list of your concerns prior to the meeting.  this can help keep you on point. ","I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. It’s brave of you to acknowledge your feelings and reach out for guidance. Here are some steps to help you navigate this situation:

### 1. **Understand Your Feelings**
   - Reflect on how you’ve been feeling lately. Are you experiencing persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, changes in sleep or appetite, low energy, or feelings of hopelessness? These could be signs of depression, but only a mental health professional can provide a proper diagnosis.
   - Keep a journal to track your emotions and thoughts. This can help you better understand your feelings and provide clarity when you talk to someone.

### 2. **Talk to Someone You Trust**
   - If you’re unsure how to bring this up with your parents, consider talking to another trusted adult first, like a teacher, school counselor, or family friend. They can offer support and help you prepare to talk to your parents.
   - If you feel ready to talk to your parents, choose a calm moment when they’re not distracted. You could start by saying something like, “I’ve been feeling really down lately, and I think I might need some help.”

### 3. **Write It Down**
   - If it feels too hard to say it out loud, write a letter or note to your parents. This can help you organize your thoughts and make it easier to express yourself. You could write something like, “I’ve been struggling with my emotions, and I’m not sure why. I think I might need to talk to someone about it.”

### 4. **Seek Professional Help**
   - If you’re worried you might be depressed, reaching out to a mental health professional is important. They can help you understand what’s going on and provide support or treatment.
   - If your parents are supportive, ask them to help you find a therapist or counselor. If you’re unsure about their reaction, research local resources or talk to a school counselor who can guide you.

### 5. **Take Care of Yourself**
   - While you’re figuring things out, try to take small steps to care for yourself. Get enough sleep, eat regular meals, and engage in activities you enjoy, even if it feels hard.
   - Practice self-compassion. It’s okay to feel this way, and seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.

### 6. **Remember You’re Not Alone**
   - Many people struggle with similar feelings, and there’s no shame in asking for help. You deserve support and understanding.

291,"People have been calling me names, and I have had enough of it. I cannot stand it anymore I'm done. I have told someone this, and that is why I am writing this. The thoughts are awful.","It's sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed with intrusive thoughts and are feeling very criticized by others as well. I think it is great that you are reaching out and I can tell that you want this to change. Working with a competent therapist may be a good option for getting some more clarity about what is going on, developing ways to cope, and eventually getting relief from these overwhelming experiences.","I’m really sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way. Being called names and dealing with hurtful behavior from others can be incredibly painful and overwhelming. It’s important to remember that you don’t deserve to be treated this way, and your feelings are completely valid.

It’s good that you’ve told someone about what you’re going through—that’s a brave and important step. Sometimes, sharing your struggles with someone you trust can help lighten the emotional load and provide support. If you haven’t already, consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, counselor, or therapist who can offer guidance and help you navigate these feelings.

Here are a few things that might help:

1. **Set Boundaries**: If possible, distance yourself from the people who are treating you poorly. You have the right to protect your mental and emotional well-being.

2. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Remind yourself that the hurtful words and actions of others are not a reflection of your worth. You are valuable and deserving of respect.

3. **Seek Professional Support**: A therapist or counselor can help you process these feelings and develop strategies to cope with the situation.

4. **Focus on Positive Relationships**: Surround yourself with people who uplift and support you. Healthy relationships can make a big difference.

5. **Express Yourself**: Writing, art, or other creative outlets can be a way to process your emotions and release some of the pain.

6. **Consider Reporting**: If the behavior is happening in a school, workplace, or other environment, consider reporting it to someone in authority who can address it.

1537,"I've been with a man for four years. For the last year, he has said he is done, but he still talks, texts, visits, and has not moved on with anyone else. His words do not match his actions. I love this man, but it's hurting so much.","This can be difficult and confusing.If you think your boyfriend would be open to having a discussion, try asking him for a time when he is willing to have an important discussion. When that time matches with a time that is good for you, try discussing the type of relationship that you each want to have and what you can start and stop doing to get there. He may want to be really good friends. He may also be trying to figure out what he is feeling. If you end up talking over one another, try letting one person be the one who is talking about their feelings for about five minutes and during that time, try having the other person asked questions to gain more understanding of their experience. Then you can switch. Also consider asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no, but lead to more explanations.Questions that start with the words how, what, when, who are usually better than questions starting with ""why"" because they can be emotional triggers for some people.If this is difficult to do between the two of you, consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couples.","I’m so sorry you’re going through this—it sounds incredibly painful and confusing. It’s clear that you love him deeply, but the inconsistency between his words and actions is causing you emotional distress. Here are some thoughts and steps you might consider to help navigate this situation:

### 1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**
   - Your pain is valid. Being in a relationship where someone says they’re “done” but continues to stay in your life can create a lot of emotional turmoil. It’s okay to feel hurt, confused, and even frustrated.

### 2. **Clarify His Intentions**
   - Have an honest and direct conversation with him. Ask him to clarify what he truly wants. If he says he’s done, but his actions suggest otherwise, it’s important to understand why he’s still in your life. Is he afraid of being alone? Is he unsure about his feelings? This conversation might help you both gain clarity.

### 3. **Set Boundaries**
   - If his mixed signals are hurting you, it’s okay to set boundaries. For example, you might let him know that if he’s truly done, you need space to heal and move on. Continuing to talk, text, and visit without clear intentions can prevent both of you from moving forward.

### 4. **Focus on Your Needs**
   - While you love him, it’s important to prioritize your own emotional well-being. Ask yourself what you truly need and want from a relationship. Are you willing to stay in this limbo, or do you need clarity and commitment to feel secure?

### 5. **Consider Letting Go**
   - If he’s unable to give you the clarity or commitment you need, it might be time to consider letting go. Holding onto someone who is emotionally unavailable can prolong your pain. Letting go doesn’t mean you stop loving him—it means you choose to love yourself enough to seek a healthier, more fulfilling relationship.

### 6. **Seek Support**
   - Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about what you’re going through. Having a support system can help you process your emotions and make decisions that are best for you.

### 7. **Give Yourself Time**
   - Healing from a relationship like this takes time. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself to grieve the loss of what you hoped the relationship could be.

Ultimately, you deserve a relationship where you feel loved, respected, and secure. If this man is unable to provide that, it might be time to consider moving on, even though it’s hard. You are worthy of a love that is consistent and fulfilling.",0.46902012825012207
1442,"I'm applying to private high schools. I'm playing basketball on my school team currently, and I love it. I also play on a team that I've hated since the beginning, and I finally want to quit before the season gets started. However, my parents say I can play on either both teams or neither. I think it's unfair because it's up to me if I want to play for a certain team. I was planning on playing basketball for the high school I get into, but if that means continuing to play for the team I hate, then I wouldn't want to play in high school. Now I don't know what to do! My parents are threatening to send me off to a different home if I don't play. I just want to run away.","The situation in your family seems to place unnecessary pressure on you.Are you and your parents able to talk together about their reason for their standard?Are your parents willing to listen to your reasons to not play on the team you hate?If yes, then maybe some type of compromise is possible for all of you to negotiate.If none of the above is possible, then you may want to get specific and direct advice from a professional, such as the school guidance counselor or psychologist, whom you'd trust and feel safe in talking.I hope you and your parents will find an answer that all of you are happy to accept.","I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way—it sounds like you’re in a tough situation, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling frustrated and overwhelmed. Let’s break this down and see if we can find a way to approach it constructively.

### 1. **Understand Your Parents’ Perspective**
   Your parents might be trying to teach you about commitment, responsibility, or perseverance. They may also see playing on both teams as a way to strengthen your skills or college applications. While their approach might feel harsh, understanding their reasoning could help you have a more productive conversation with them.

### 2. **Communicate Calmly and Clearly**
   Instead of arguing or shutting down, try to explain your feelings in a calm and respectful way. For example:
   - “I really love playing basketball for my school team, but the other team has been making me unhappy for a long time. I’ve tried to stick with it, but it’s affecting my mental health and my love for the sport.”
   - “I’m worried that if I have to keep playing for both teams, I might end up quitting basketball altogether, which would make me really sad because it’s something I’m passionate about.”

### 3. **Offer a Compromise**
   If your parents are insistent on you playing basketball, see if you can find a middle ground. For example:
   - Suggest focusing on your school team and joining a different extracurricular activity instead of the other team.
   - Propose taking a break from the team you dislike and revisiting the decision later.

### 4. **Seek Support from a Trusted Adult**
   If your parents aren’t open to listening, consider talking to a coach, teacher, or family friend who knows you well and might be able to mediate the conversation. Sometimes, hearing from another adult can help your parents see your perspective.

### 5. **Don’t Make Impulsive Decisions**
   Running away or giving up on basketball entirely might feel like the only options right now, but these decisions could have long-term consequences. Try to focus on finding a solution that allows you to keep playing the sport you love while also protecting your mental health.

### 6. **Think About the Bigger Picture**
   You mentioned you’re applying to private high schools and want to play basketball there. If you quit now, will that affect your chances of making the team in high school? On the other hand, if you’re truly miserable on the other team, it’s worth considering whether it’s worth the toll on your well-being.

### 7. **Take Care of Yourself**
   It’s okay to feel upset and overwhelmed, but try to find healthy ways to cope, like talking to a friend, journaling, or doing something you enjoy. If you’re feeling really desperate, consider reaching out to a counselor or helpline for support.

### 8. **Remember This Is Temporary**
   This situation won’t last forever. High school is a new chapter, and you’ll have more opportunities to make decisions for yourself as you get older. Hang in there and focus on finding a way to get through this tough time.

If you ever feel unsafe or like running away is your only option, please talk to a trusted adult or contact a helpline in your area. You’re not alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help.",0.5254562497138977
3193,"Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes  I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I can't get it out.  How can I stop these thoughts?","Hi there,I first want to let you know that having these thoughts is completely normal. Studies have been done that show that 80% of human thoughts are ""negative"" so you are not alone. I like to think of thoughts as a tornado... if you are in a tornado, you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial. However, when you are, let's say, a mile away from a tornado, it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as get shelter or make sure your family and friends are safe. When unhelpful or scary thoughts arise, we tend to start a ""war"" with them, which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado. This makes the thoughts and emotions bigger and intensifies the feelings that go with them. So the question I imagine you have is ""how do I get out of the tornado?"" There are 3 steps to doing this:Get distance from your thoughts by adding ""I am noticing I'm having the thought that...."" to the front of them. For example, ""I am noticing I am having the thought that something bad is going to happen to me.""   The purpose of this is not to decrease your fear or get rid of the thought. These thoughts might always be there and that is okay because that is how the mind naturally works so struggling with that is a waste of time and energy. The purpose is to gain some distance from the thoughts so you don't get swept away by them. You can imagine them floating along like leaves in a stream or clouds in the sky (and often the same thought will come back again and again but that's okay... just continue to notice it with curiosity). I imagine the thoughts get in your way of doing what really matters to you so if you can get a little bit of distance, you can do things that are fulfilling and meaningful to you. Tune into your body and notice what sensations come up and where you feel them most intensely. Then breathe into them and make room for them. Our 5 main emotions are: joy, sadness, fear/anxiety, shame, and anger. ALL of these emotions are part of being human and there is no escaping them. So again, struggling with them ends up intensifying them. Instead, let them be and make a little bit of room for them. Often a side effect of this is the intensity will decrease but it might not. The purpose is to keep them from becoming more intense. Contact the present moment. Notice what is happening here and now. One way of doing this is tuning into the five senses. What are some things you hear, see, taste, smell, and feel? Another way is to notice what is happening in your body (without trying to change it). How deep are your breaths, what is happening with your heart rate, are you cold/warm, etc?Implementing these three steps can help you to refrain from getting caught up in your unhelpful thoughts. Unfortunately there is no way to get rid of thoughts or feelings completely. So the only option that works in the long run is to accept them while continuing to do what matters to you and what is fulfilling to you.I hope this helps!","It’s completely normal to experience intrusive or scary thoughts from time to time, but when they become repetitive and overwhelming, it can be distressing. Here are some strategies to help you manage and stop these thoughts:

### 1. **Acknowledge the Thought Without Judgment**
   - Recognize that the thought is just a thought, not a fact. It doesn’t define you or predict the future.
   - Try saying to yourself, “This is just a thought, and it will pass.”

### 2. **Practice Grounding Techniques**
   - Grounding helps bring your focus back to the present moment. Try the **5-4-3-2-1 technique**:
     - Name 5 things you can see.
     - 4 things you can touch.
     - 3 things you can hear.
     - 2 things you can smell.
     - 1 thing you can taste.

### 3. **Challenge the Thought**
   - Ask yourself: “Is this thought realistic? What evidence do I have that this will actually happen?”
   - Replace the scary thought with a more balanced or positive one. For example, “I’m safe right now, and I can handle whatever comes my way.”

### 4. **Distract Yourself**
   - Engage in an activity that requires focus, like reading, drawing, solving a puzzle, or exercising.
   - Physical activity, in particular, can help reduce anxiety and break the cycle of rumination.

### 5. **Practice Mindfulness or Meditation**
   - Mindfulness helps you observe your thoughts without getting caught up in them. Apps like Headspace or Calm can guide you through meditation practices.
   - Focus on your breath or a calming mantra to redirect your attention.

### 6. **Set a Worry Time**
   - Designate a specific time each day (e.g., 10 minutes) to process your scary thoughts. If they arise outside of this time, remind yourself, “I’ll think about this during my worry time.”

### 7. **Limit Triggers**
   - Identify situations, people, or media (e.g., scary movies, news) that trigger these thoughts and reduce your exposure to them.

### 8. **Talk to Someone**
   - Share your feelings with a trusted friend, family member, or therapist. Talking about your thoughts can help you gain perspective and feel less alone.

### 9. **Practice Self-Compassion**
   - Be kind to yourself. Remind yourself that it’s okay to have these thoughts and that you’re doing your best to manage them.

### 10. **Seek Professional Help**
   - If these thoughts are persistent, overwhelming, or interfere with your daily life, consider reaching out to a mental health professional. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is particularly effective for managing intrusive thoughts.

2605,"I started dating my fiancé two years ago. My first cousin is married to my fiancé’s sister. There has always been a communication issue between my uncle and aunt and my cousin and his wife. My uncle goes to my mom instead of talking to my cousin, and it upsets my mom.","Based on the information provided, this is an issue with boundaries.   Sounds like your uncle goes to your mom and possibly your mother takes the issues to you.  I do not like to assume so I will direct you to information regarding families dealing with enmeshment and triangulation.  Enmeshment is the concept of diffused boundaries in families and other personal relationships.  Triangulation is two individuals relaying information to a third party what cannot be said directly to each other.  From someone who has dealt with both these issues on a personal level, being informed about family dynamics is beneficial and can help you develop healthy boundaries for yourself within your family structure.  You may need assistance with developing healthy boundaries.  Although it is possible, it is not easy to change the way you have been operating for any extended amount of time.  Hope this help!","It sounds like there’s a complex family dynamic at play, and the communication issues between your uncle, aunt, cousin, and his wife are creating tension that’s affecting your mom. Here are a few steps you might consider to help address the situation:

1. **Acknowledge the Issue**: Recognize that the communication breakdown is causing stress for your mom and likely for others involved. It’s important to validate her feelings and let her know you understand her frustration.

2. **Encourage Direct Communication**: Gently suggest to your uncle and aunt that they try to address concerns directly with your cousin and his wife. Indirect communication (like going through your mom) can create misunderstandings and escalate tension.

3. **Set Boundaries**: If your mom feels burdened by being the middle person, she might need to set boundaries. For example, she could politely encourage your uncle to speak directly to his son and daughter-in-law instead of involving her.

4. **Facilitate a Conversation**: If appropriate, you could offer to mediate or suggest a family meeting where everyone can express their feelings in a calm and respectful environment. Sometimes, having a neutral party present can help ease tensions.

5. **Focus on Your Relationship**: While it’s natural to want to help, remember that this issue is ultimately between your uncle, aunt, cousin, and his wife. Try not to let it overshadow your relationship with your fiancé or the excitement of your engagement.

6. **Seek Professional Help**: If the situation doesn’t improve, consider suggesting family counseling. A professional can help facilitate healthier communication and resolve underlying issues.

1. **Mutual Commitment to Reconciliation**: For a marriage to be saved, both partners need to be fully committed to repairing the relationship. If your former husband stops sleeping with others but isn't genuinely invested in rebuilding the marriage, it may not lead to lasting change. It’s important to have honest conversations about whether he is willing to work on the relationship with you.

2. **Addressing the Root Causes**: The fact that he walked away from the marriage in 2008 and has been seeing someone else for years suggests there are deeper issues in the relationship. These could include emotional disconnection, unmet needs, or unresolved conflicts. If you both decide to try again, it’s crucial to address these issues, possibly with the help of a couples therapist.

3. **Your Needs and Boundaries**: You’ve already made sacrifices by stopping sexual relationships with others in hopes of saving the marriage. It’s important to reflect on what you truly need and want in a relationship. Are you willing to continue investing in a marriage where your partner may not be equally committed? Setting clear boundaries and understanding your own limits is essential.

4. **The Role of the Other Relationship**: If he has been seeing someone else on and off for years, it suggests that this relationship may be significant to him. Even if he decides to stop seeing her, it’s important to understand the emotional impact this has had on him and on your marriage. Trust may need to be rebuilt, and this can take time and effort.

5. **Your Feelings and Well-Being**: You mention that you still care deeply for him, which is understandable after 14 years of marriage. However, it’s also important to consider your own emotional well-being. Staying in a relationship that is one-sided or causes you ongoing pain may not be healthy in the long term.

### What You Can Do:
- **Communicate Openly**: Have an honest conversation with him about where you both stand and whether you both want to try to save the marriage.
- **Seek Professional Help**: A couples therapist can help you both navigate these complex emotions and dynamics.
- **Reflect on Your Needs**: Take time to consider what you truly want and need in a relationship. Are you willing to continue investing in this marriage if he is not fully committed?
- **Consider the Future**: Think about what your life might look like if you stay together versus if you part ways. Which path aligns more closely with your long-term happiness and well-being?

Ultimately, the decision to save the marriage or part ways is deeply personal and depends on both of your willingness to work on the relationship. If he is not fully committed to rebuilding the marriage, it may be difficult to create a healthy and fulfilling partnership. Take care of yourself and prioritize your emotional well-being as you navigate this challenging situation.",0.4669530987739563
1697,"I've been going through a rough time lately. I been into nothing but women. I’ve never thought about men until a week ago. I’m very upset and depressed about this. It's not normal to me. I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that I’m not gay. I get the same results each time, and I feel disgust. This is tough on me. I'm scared that I looked too many times. I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.","Are you able to give yourself some peace of mind while you take the time to further address whether or not you are gay?Whether or not and to what degree a person accepts their sexuality, depends on dense factors such as the culture of your family, the beliefs about gay people with which you were brought up, and your own tolerance for being a unique individual.Examining these factors, whether inwardly by yourself, in online blogs and sites, or live with other people, requires patience and effort.The more you are willing to commit to figuring out your own truth, the greater is your chance of finding it!","I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way—it sounds like you’re going through a lot of confusion and distress right now. First, I want to reassure you that what you’re feeling is valid, and it’s okay to have questions or uncertainties about your identity. It’s also okay to feel scared or overwhelmed when you’re exploring something new or unfamiliar about yourself.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. **Sexuality is a spectrum**: Sexuality isn’t always black and white. It’s possible to feel attracted to different genders in different ways, and those feelings can change over time. What you’re experiencing doesn’t necessarily mean you’re gay, straight, or anything else—it’s just part of your journey of understanding yourself.

2. **It’s okay to explore**: Curiosity about your sexuality is completely normal. Looking at gay porn doesn’t define your identity—it’s just a way of exploring your feelings. If it doesn’t resonate with you, that’s okay. If it does, that’s also okay. Either way, it’s part of learning more about yourself.

3. **Be kind to yourself**: It’s easy to feel disgusted or upset with yourself when you’re struggling with something that feels unfamiliar or uncomfortable. Try to treat yourself with the same compassion you’d offer a friend going through a tough time. You’re not doing anything wrong by exploring your feelings.

4. **It’s not about “proving” anything**: You don’t need to prove your sexuality to yourself or anyone else. Sexuality is deeply personal, and there’s no “right” or “wrong” way to feel. Focus on what feels authentic to you, rather than trying to fit into a specific label.

5. **Talk to someone you trust**: If you’re feeling overwhelmed, it might help to talk to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist. A therapist, in particular, can provide a safe, nonjudgmental space to explore your feelings and work through your concerns.

6. **Give yourself time**: It’s okay not to have all the answers right now. Sexuality can be complex, and it’s okay to take your time to figure things out. There’s no rush—you’re allowed to explore and grow at your own pace.

You’re not alone in this, and there’s nothing wrong with you for having these thoughts or feelings. It’s okay to feel scared, but try to remind yourself that you’re just figuring things out, and that’s a normal part of life. Be patient with yourself, and know that it’s okay to seek support when you need it. You’re going to be okay.",0.500998318195343
2700,I blame my past relationship for it. I know it is bad to be this way. I want to get past it.,"We humans are social beings. We learn how to BE in relationship as children. The caregiving you received (or didn't receive) set the stage for how you show up in all your adult relationships. Insecurity in relationships often has much to do with feeling unheard or unseen, perhaps feeling like you don't matter. There are many ways to rewire these relational patterns, the first step of which is taking pause and noticing that you are feeling insecure - so congrats on that because clearly you are already there!  Next I'd suggest finding a relationship therapist to help you sort through your insecurities, either as a couple or individually. ","It’s completely understandable to feel this way after a difficult or painful relationship. Relationships can leave deep emotional imprints, and it’s natural to carry some of that with you. The fact that you recognize this and want to move forward is a huge step in the right direction. Here are some steps that might help you heal and get past it:

### 1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**
   - It’s okay to feel hurt, angry, or sad about what happened. Suppressing these emotions can make it harder to move on. Allow yourself to feel them without judgment.

### 2. **Reflect Without Dwelling**
   - Reflect on the relationship to understand what happened and what you’ve learned, but avoid ruminating on it. Ask yourself: *What did I learn from this experience? How can I grow from it?*

### 3. **Take Responsibility for Your Healing**
   - While the past relationship may have contributed to your feelings, your healing is ultimately in your hands. Focus on what you can do now to take care of yourself.

### 4. **Practice Self-Compassion**
   - Be kind to yourself. You’re not perfect, and that’s okay. Remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes and goes through tough times.

### 5. **Let Go of Blame**
   - Blaming the past relationship or yourself keeps you tied to it. Try to release that blame and focus on the present and future instead.

### 6. **Seek Support**
   - Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about what you’re going through. Sometimes, sharing your feelings with someone who cares can be incredibly healing.

### 7. **Focus on the Present**
   - Engage in activities that bring you joy or a sense of purpose. Mindfulness practices, like meditation or journaling, can help you stay grounded in the present moment.

### 8. **Set Boundaries**
   - If contact with your ex or reminders of the relationship are triggering, consider setting boundaries to protect your emotional well-being.

### 9. **Work on Self-Growth**
   - Use this experience as an opportunity to grow. Explore new hobbies, set personal goals, or work on building your self-confidence.

### 10. **Give It Time**
   - Healing isn’t linear, and it takes time. Be patient with yourself and trust that, with effort, you’ll gradually feel better.

Remember, it’s not about forgetting the past but about learning from it and moving forward in a way that empowers you. You’ve already taken the first step by wanting to change—that’s something to be proud of. You’ve got this!",0.4984302520751953
203,"I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.
 I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. While your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard. Talk to them during a non-emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as ""you NEVER listen,"" ""you ALWAYS say..."" and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with ""you"" try using ""I"" by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist, teacher, or school counselor if possible. Most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help.Best of luck to you.","I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way. It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of pain and loneliness, and it’s incredibly brave of you to share this. You’re not alone, even if it feels that way right now. Let’s break this down and see if we can find some ways to help you feel more supported and understood.

### 1. **Your Relationship with Your Parents**
It’s really hard when the people who are supposed to understand and support you don’t seem to take you seriously. It’s clear you love your parents, but it’s okay to feel hurt by their behavior. Here are a few thoughts:
   - **Communication Barriers:** Sometimes, generational differences can make it hard for parents to understand their children’s experiences. They might not realize how their reactions affect you.
   - **Expressing Your Feelings:** If you feel safe doing so, try writing them a letter or having a calm conversation where you explain how their dismissiveness makes you feel. Focus on your emotions rather than blaming them (e.g., “I feel hurt when I’m not taken seriously”).
   - **Seeking Support Elsewhere:** If they’re not able to provide the support you need, it’s okay to look for it elsewhere. This doesn’t mean you love them any less—it’s about taking care of yourself.

### 2. **Your Identity and Trust**
Being pansexual in an environment where you don’t feel understood or accepted can be incredibly isolating. It’s okay to protect your heart and not share everything with people who might not respond in a supportive way. Here are some ideas:
   - **Find a Safe Space:** Look for LGBTQ+ communities or support groups (online or in person) where you can connect with people who understand and validate your experiences.
   - **Build Trust Slowly:** Trust is earned, and it’s okay to take your time sharing your identity with others. You deserve to feel safe and respected.

### 3. **Your Mental Health**
It’s amazing that you’ve fought depression and won—that’s a huge accomplishment. But stress and anxiety can still feel overwhelming. Here’s how you might manage:
   - **Self-Care:** Prioritize activities that help you feel calm and grounded, like journaling, meditation, exercise, or creative outlets.
   - **Professional Support:** If possible, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you process your feelings and develop coping strategies.
   - **Emergency Resources:** If anxiety or stress ever feels too much to handle, reach out to a crisis hotline or text line in your area. You’re not alone, and there are people who want to help.

### 4. **Your Friendships**
It’s tough when you feel like your friends aren’t there for you in the way you need. Here’s how you might approach this:
   - **Communicate Your Needs:** Let your friends know how you’re feeling and what kind of support you’re looking for. Sometimes people don’t realize what you need unless you tell them.
   - **Evaluate the Relationship:** If a friendship feels one-sided, it’s okay to step back and focus on relationships that are more reciprocal. You deserve friends who care about your well-being as much as you care about theirs.
   - **Expand Your Circle:** Consider joining clubs, groups, or online communities where you can meet people who share your interests and values.

### 5. **Reclaiming Your Childhood**
It’s heartbreaking to feel like your childhood has been taken from you. While you can’t change the past, you can focus on creating moments of joy and freedom in your life now. Here’s how:
   - **Do Things You Enjoy:** Make time for activities that bring you happiness, whether it’s art, music, gaming, or something else.
   - **Be Kind to Yourself:** You’ve been through a lot, and it’s okay to grieve what you’ve lost. Treat yourself with the same compassion you’d show a friend.
   - **Focus on the Future:** While it’s hard right now, you have the power to build a life that feels fulfilling and joyful. Take small steps toward the future you want.

### 6. **You’re Not Alone**
Even if it feels like no one understands you, there are people out there who will. Keep reaching out, even if it’s just to online communities or support groups. You matter, and your feelings are valid.

### Final Thought:
You’re incredibly strong for navigating all of this on your own. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed, but please remember that you deserve love, understanding, and support. Take things one day at a time, and don’t hesitate to lean on resources or people who can help. You’re not alone, and there’s hope for brighter days ahead. 💛",0.4434954524040222

How do I help him?",How do you help yourself to believe you require more than what he offers to you?What do you get from this relationship which feels satisfying?To answer this question may in the longterm be the best way to help your bf.,"It sounds like your partner might be struggling with feelings of depression, burnout, or a lack of purpose, and the current routine might be reinforcing those feelings. While it’s great that you want to help, it’s important to approach this with care and understanding. Here are some steps you can take to support him:

---

### 1. **Start with a Gentle Conversation**
   - Choose a calm, non-judgmental moment to talk. Express your concern in a loving way, focusing on how you’ve noticed changes in his mood or behavior.
   - Example: “I’ve noticed you seem a bit down lately, and I just want you to know I’m here for you. Is there anything on your mind that you’d like to talk about?”
   - Avoid blaming or pressuring him to “fix” things immediately.

---

### 2. **Encourage Small, Positive Changes**
   - Start with small, manageable steps to break the cycle of inactivity. For example:
     - Suggest a short walk outside together.
     - Cook a meal together instead of ordering takeout.
     - Introduce a new hobby or activity, like playing a board game, gardening, or trying a creative project.
   - These small changes can help shift his mindset and create a sense of accomplishment.

---

### 3. **Limit Substances Like Weed**
   - While weed might provide temporary relief, it can exacerbate feelings of lethargy, lack of motivation, and even depression. Encourage him to reduce or take a break from smoking, and offer alternatives like exercise or mindfulness practices.

---

### 4. **Create a Balanced Routine**
   - Help him establish a healthier daily routine, even on weekends. For example:
     - Encourage waking up earlier and having a consistent sleep schedule.
     - Plan activities that get him out of the house, like visiting a park, going to a museum, or meeting friends.
   - A structured routine can provide a sense of purpose and reduce feelings of aimlessness.

---

### 5. **Support His Mental Health**
   - Suggest professional help if he’s open to it. Therapy or counseling can provide tools to manage depression, anger, or lack of motivation.
   - If he’s hesitant, you could offer to help him research therapists or even accompany him to an appointment for support.

---

### 6. **Be a Positive Influence**
   - Model healthy behaviors yourself. For example, if you’re active, motivated, or engaged in hobbies, he may be inspired to join you.
   - Celebrate small wins and progress, even if it’s just getting out of bed earlier or trying something new.

---

### 7. **Encourage Social Connections**
   - Isolation can worsen depression. Encourage him to reconnect with friends or family, even if it’s just a phone call or a casual hangout.
   - If he’s open to it, suggest joining a group or club related to his interests.

---

### 8. **Be Patient and Compassionate**
   - Change takes time, and he may not respond immediately to your efforts. Avoid pushing too hard or making him feel judged.
   - Remind him that it’s okay to struggle and that you’re there to support him, not to “fix” him.

---

### 9. **Take Care of Yourself**
   - Supporting someone who’s struggling can be emotionally draining. Make sure you’re also taking time for self-care and setting boundaries when needed.
   - Consider talking to a therapist or trusted friend about your own feelings and experiences.

---

### 10. **Know When to Seek Help**
   - If his depression or anger becomes severe, or if he expresses thoughts of self-harm, seek professional help immediately. You can contact a crisis hotline or mental health professional for guidance.

33,"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",There is no such thing as too many issues for counseling. Many issues are often interrelated and can all be worked on with some time and patience.,"First, I want to acknowledge the strength and resilience it takes to carry so much and still keep moving forward. Your experiences—surviving sexual abuse, battling breast cancer, managing lifelong insomnia, and coping with depression and anxiety—are deeply significant, and it’s understandable that they’ve shaped your life in profound ways. The fact that you’re considering counseling is a courageous and important step toward healing and self-care.

To answer your question: **No, you don’t have too many issues to address in counseling.** Counseling is a space where you can explore and process all of these experiences at your own pace. A skilled therapist will help you prioritize and address what feels most pressing while also supporting you in understanding how these issues may be interconnected. Here are a few things to consider:

1. **Counseling is a Safe Space for All Your Concerns:** Therapists are trained to work with clients who have complex histories and multiple challenges. You don’t have to “fix” everything at once. The process is about understanding, healing, and building tools to cope.

2. **Prioritizing Your Needs:** You and your therapist can work together to identify which issues are most affecting your daily life and start there. For example, if anxiety is becoming overwhelming, that might be a good starting point. Over time, you can explore other areas as you feel ready.

3. **Healing is Holistic:** Your experiences—both traumatic and triumphant—are part of your story. Counseling can help you see how these pieces fit together and how they’ve shaped your self-esteem, relationships, and overall well-being. It’s not about “fixing” everything but about finding understanding, peace, and growth.

4. **Your Marriage is a Strength:** The fact that you’ve been happily married for 35 years is a testament to your capacity for connection and love. This can be a source of support as you work through other challenges in counseling.

5. **You’re Not Alone:** Many people come to counseling with multiple concerns, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed at first. A therapist’s role is to help you navigate these feelings and create a path forward that feels manageable and empowering.

If you’re feeling unsure about where to start, you might consider reaching out to a therapist who has experience in trauma, chronic illness, and mental health. Many therapists offer free consultations, which can help you find someone who feels like the right fit.

Remember, seeking counseling is a gift to yourself. It’s not about having too many issues—it’s about giving yourself the space to heal and grow. You’ve already shown incredible strength in surviving and thriving through so much. Counseling can be the next step in honoring your journey and finding greater peace and self-compassion.

### 2. **Seek Professional Help**
   - **Therapist or Counselor:** A mental health professional can provide support, guidance, and tools to help you cope. If you don’t have a therapist, you can search for one online or ask your doctor for a referral.
   - **Hotlines or Crisis Support:** If you’re feeling overwhelmed, consider reaching out to a crisis hotline. They’re available 24/7 and are staffed by trained listeners:
     - **National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (U.S.):** Call or text 988
     - **Crisis Text Line:** Text “HELLO” to 741741 (U.S. and Canada)

3000,My fiancé and I broke up. He cheated on me numerous times. I kept forgiving but questioning his every move. He got tired and left.,if he as cheated on you multiple times it is not healthy for you to continue seeing him.  However It takes time to heal your pain. You are not a robot that can just switch off your emotions.  Please surround yourself with people who can support and empower you. ,"I'm so sorry you're going through this. It sounds like you've been carrying a heavy emotional burden for a while. Infidelity and mistrust can deeply wound a relationship, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling hurt and conflicted. While it’s painful now, it’s important to remember that his actions and choices are not a reflection of your worth or value.

Forgiving someone repeatedly takes immense strength, but it’s also essential to prioritize your own well-being and self-respect. A relationship built on mistrust and repeated betrayal can be exhausting and emotionally draining. His decision to leave may feel like a loss, but it could also be an opportunity for you to heal and rebuild your sense of self.

Take time to grieve the relationship and process your emotions. Surround yourself with supportive friends or family, and consider seeking therapy or counseling if you feel overwhelmed. Healing from this will take time, but you deserve a relationship built on trust, respect, and mutual care—one where you don’t have to question your partner’s every move.

358,"I have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.","Something to remember about anxiety is that it's a useful and necessary response to stressors, and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming. Anxiety is our brain's way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action. Some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. The first I'd recommend is a calm breathing technique - breathe in for 4-5 seconds, and then out for 7-8 seconds. Try to repeat this for 3-5 minutes. Another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe - without judging - the sensations to yourself. Try to be very specific, such as ""my palms are feeling very sweaty, and I can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies."" Then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad - just experiencing them as intentionally as possible.  Combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful. If you feel that these techniques don't help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to, then I'd highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional. This professional can help you determine if therapy/counseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms.","It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed by the demands of daily life, especially when juggling finances, work, relationships, parenting, and household responsibilities. These stressors can feel heavy, but there are strategies to help manage them and reduce anxiety. Here are some practical steps you can take:

### 1. **Break Things Down**

   - Focus on small, achievable financial goals rather than feeling overwhelmed by the big picture.

### 5. **Communicate in Relationships**
   - Share your feelings with trusted loved ones. They may not realize how much you’re carrying.
   - Seek support or counseling if relationship dynamics are a significant source of stress.

### 6. **Take Care of Your Physical Health**
   - **Exercise regularly:** Even a short walk can reduce anxiety.
   - **Eat well and stay hydrated:** Proper nutrition supports mental health.
   - **Sleep:** Prioritize rest to recharge your mind and body.

### 7. **Practice Mindfulness and Relaxation**
   - Try deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to calm your mind.
   - Set aside a few minutes daily for activities that bring you joy or relaxation.

### 8. **Seek Support**
   - Talk to a therapist or counselor to explore coping strategies tailored to your needs.
   - Join a support group or connect with others facing similar challenges.

### 9. **Focus on What You Can Control**

How can I get more confident?","I can offer you hypnosis for confidence in presentations, via Skype, if you're in Cali.","It’s completely normal to feel stressed and less confident when it comes to presentations, especially if you’re naturally shy. The good news is that confidence can be built over time with practice and the right strategies. Here are some practical tips to help you feel more confident during presentations:

### 1. **Prepare Thoroughly**
   - **Know your material inside and out.** The more familiar you are with your content, the more confident you’ll feel.
   - Practice your presentation multiple times, ideally in front of a mirror, a friend, or even record yourself to identify areas for improvement.
   - Anticipate potential questions and prepare answers in advance.

### 2. **Start Small**
   - Begin by presenting to smaller, more familiar groups (e.g., classmates or friends) to build your comfort level.
   - Gradually work your way up to larger audiences as your confidence grows.

### 3. **Focus on Your Audience**
   - Remember that your audience wants you to succeed. They’re there to learn from you, not to judge you.
   - Shift your focus from yourself (e.g., “What if I mess up?”) to the value you’re providing to your audience.

### 4. **Use Positive Self-Talk**
   - Replace negative thoughts (“I’m going to fail”) with positive affirmations (“I’m prepared, and I can do this”).
   - Remind yourself that it’s okay to make mistakes—nobody is perfect.

### 5. **Practice Relaxation Techniques**
   - Deep breathing exercises can help calm your nerves before and during your presentation. Try inhaling for 4 counts, holding for 4 counts, and exhaling for 8 counts.
   - Progressive muscle relaxation (tensing and releasing muscles) can also reduce physical tension.

### 6. **Visualize Success**
   - Spend a few minutes before your presentation imagining yourself delivering it confidently and receiving positive feedback. Visualization can help reduce anxiety and boost confidence.

### 7. **Improve Your Body Language**
   - Stand tall, maintain eye contact, and use open gestures to project confidence.
   - Smile occasionally—it can make you feel more relaxed and help connect with your audience.

### 8. **Engage Your Audience**
   - Ask questions, use humor (if appropriate), or share relatable stories to make your presentation more interactive and less intimidating.
   - Interaction can take the focus off you and make the experience more conversational.

### 9. **Start with a Strong Opening**
   - Begin with a confident and engaging introduction to set the tone for your presentation. This can help you feel more in control right from the start.

### 10. **Seek Feedback and Reflect**
   - After each presentation, ask for constructive feedback from peers or professors. Use this to improve for next time.
   - Reflect on what went well and celebrate small victories, even if it’s just making it through without panicking.

### 11. **Join a Public Speaking Group**
   - Consider joining a group like Toastmasters, where you can practice public speaking in a supportive environment and receive constructive feedback.

### 12. **Be Kind to Yourself**
   - Remember that confidence takes time to build. It’s okay to feel nervous—many people do, even experienced speakers.
   - Acknowledge your progress, no matter how small, and keep pushing yourself out of your comfort zone.

### 13. **Use Notes as a Safety Net**
   - Having notes or an outline can help you stay on track and reduce anxiety about forgetting what to say. Just don’t rely on them too heavily.

### 14. **Practice Regularly**
   - The more you present, the more comfortable you’ll become. Look for opportunities to speak in class, at meetings, or in other settings.

### 15. **Celebrate Your Efforts**
   - Recognize that stepping up to present, even when it’s uncomfortable, is a sign of courage. Reward yourself for your efforts, whether it’s treating yourself to something you enjoy or simply acknowledging your growth.

Remember, confidence isn’t about being perfect—it’s about being okay with imperfection and focusing on progress. With consistent effort, you’ll find yourself feeling more at ease and capable in no time. You’ve got this!",0.49886012077331543
1457,What makes a healthy marriage last?,"Thank you for your question.  A good Marriage is one that takes hard work and commitment.  Being in a good marriage does not always mean good times because let's face it; we are dealing with 2 unique individuals with differences.  A good spouse or partner knows to be patient and accepting.  Knowing each other's strengths and imperfections and working with them to lift each other is how you strengthen your love for one another.  A good spouse sacrifices their needs to see the other person happy.  Don't get me wrong, that also means that it is important to have alone time to re-charge and re-focus our purpose in the marriage.  In all, there is not a magic recipe for a successful marriage, but with time, work and purpose one can have a happy one.","A healthy, lasting marriage is built on a foundation of mutual respect, trust, communication, and commitment. While every relationship is unique, there are several key factors that contribute to a strong and enduring marriage:

### 1. **Effective Communication**
   - Open and honest dialogue is essential. Partners should feel safe expressing their thoughts, feelings, and concerns without fear of judgment.
   - Active listening—truly understanding and validating each other’s perspectives—strengthens the bond.

### 2. **Trust and Honesty**
   - Trust is the cornerstone of any healthy relationship. Being reliable, transparent, and truthful builds a sense of security.
   - Honesty, even in difficult situations, fosters mutual respect and understanding.

### 3. **Mutual Respect**
   - Respecting each other’s individuality, boundaries, and opinions is crucial. This includes valuing differences and supporting each other’s goals and dreams.
   - Avoiding contempt, criticism, or belittling behavior helps maintain a positive dynamic.

### 4. **Commitment and Dedication**
   - A lasting marriage requires a shared commitment to weathering challenges together. This means prioritizing the relationship and working as a team.
   - Partners should be willing to invest time, effort, and energy into nurturing their bond.

### 5. **Emotional Intimacy**
   - Deep emotional connection fosters closeness and understanding. Sharing vulnerabilities, dreams, and fears strengthens the relationship.
   - Regular expressions of love, appreciation, and affection help maintain intimacy.

### 6. **Conflict Resolution Skills**
   - Disagreements are natural, but how they are handled matters. Healthy couples address conflicts constructively, focusing on solutions rather than blame.
   - Compromise, empathy, and forgiveness are key to resolving issues without damaging the relationship.

### 7. **Shared Values and Goals**
   - Having common values, beliefs, and life goals creates a sense of unity and direction.
   - While individual interests are important, aligning on major decisions (e.g., finances, parenting, lifestyle) reduces friction.

### 8. **Quality Time Together**
   - Spending meaningful time together strengthens the connection. This can include shared hobbies, date nights, or simply enjoying each other’s company.
   - Prioritizing the relationship over external distractions (e.g., work, technology) is essential.

### 9. **Flexibility and Adaptability**
   - Life brings changes, and a healthy marriage requires adaptability. Being open to growth and willing to adjust to new circumstances helps the relationship evolve.
   - Supporting each other during transitions (e.g., career changes, parenting, aging) fosters resilience.

### 10. **Physical Intimacy**
   - A healthy physical connection is an important aspect of marriage. This includes not only sexual intimacy but also affectionate gestures like holding hands or hugging.
   - Open communication about needs and desires helps maintain a fulfilling physical relationship.

### 11. **Appreciation and Gratitude**
   - Regularly expressing gratitude for each other’s efforts and qualities reinforces positivity and connection.
   - Small acts of kindness and recognition go a long way in nurturing the relationship.

### 12. **Shared Laughter and Fun**
   - Humor and joy are vital to a lasting marriage. Sharing laughter and creating happy memories together strengthens the bond.
   - Maintaining a sense of playfulness and lightness helps navigate life’s challenges.

### 13. **Support During Tough Times**
   - Life can be unpredictable, and a strong marriage involves being there for each other during hardships.
   - Offering emotional support, encouragement, and understanding during difficult moments deepens the partnership.

### 14. **Continuous Growth**
   - A healthy marriage evolves over time. Partners should be committed to personal growth and growing together as a couple.
   - Seeking opportunities to learn, improve, and strengthen the relationship ensures it remains vibrant.

### 15. **Seeking Help When Needed**
   - Recognizing when outside help is needed—such as couples therapy or counseling—is a sign of strength, not weakness.
   - Professional guidance can provide tools and insights to overcome challenges and enhance the relationship.

Ultimately, a healthy marriage is a dynamic, ongoing process that requires effort, patience, and love from both partners. By prioritizing each other and nurturing the relationship, couples can build a lasting and fulfilling partnership.",0.5364152789115906
2671,"He isn't violent, but he has anger issues and deep insecurities. He's working on them and has improved. We started counseling, and he participated in one or two individual sessions, but we broke up again shortly thereafter. Now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining.","From what you write, you're not too happy with how your boyfriend treats you and how he handles his own life.What keeps you feeling connected to him in positive ways?If you're truly not happy most of the time in this relationship, then you're at the time of asking why you'd want to remain in a relationship which is draining.","It sounds like you're in a challenging situation, and it's understandable that you're feeling drained. Here are some thoughts and suggestions that might help you navigate this:

### 1. **Set Boundaries**
   - His constant questions and accusations can be emotionally exhausting. It’s important to establish clear boundaries about what you’re willing to discuss and when. For example, you could say, “I’m happy to talk about this, but if it turns into accusations, I’ll need to step away.”
   - Protect your mental health by limiting interactions that feel toxic or draining.

### 2. **Focus on Your Well-Being**
   - It’s great that he’s working on his issues, but you can’t take responsibility for his progress. Prioritize your own emotional and mental health.
   - Consider individual counseling for yourself to process your feelings and gain clarity on what you need moving forward.

### 3. **Communicate Calmly and Clearly**
   - When addressing his behavior, use “I” statements to avoid sounding accusatory. For example, “I feel drained when the conversations turn into constant questions and accusations.”
   - Encourage open, honest communication, but don’t engage in arguments or defensive exchanges.

### 4. **Evaluate the Relationship**
   - Reflect on whether this relationship is healthy for you. If his behavior continues to be draining or if progress is inconsistent, it might be worth considering whether this is the right dynamic for you.
   - Relationships should feel supportive and nurturing, not consistently exhausting.

### 5. **Encourage Continued Growth**
   - If you’re open to continuing the relationship, encourage him to stay committed to his personal growth and counseling. However, make it clear that his progress is his responsibility, not yours.
   - Suggest couples counseling if you both feel it could help address underlying issues together.

### 6. **Know When to Walk Away**
   - If his behavior doesn’t improve or if it continues to take a toll on you, it’s okay to prioritize your own well-being and walk away. You deserve a relationship that feels safe, respectful, and fulfilling.

3025,"Sometime when small thing happen, like losing a comb, I get furious.  I even start throwing things. Do I have a problem?","I don't like the word ""problem"".  It is such a strong word.  However I would say that you have an issue that needs to be addressed and controlled before it directed at the wrong person and gets totally out of control.  I have found that anger management classes has been helpful for my clients.  Try and see if it will help.  You will be surprised at what you learn about your self.","It sounds like you're experiencing intense emotional reactions to relatively small events, which can be distressing and disruptive. While it's normal to feel frustrated or upset from time to time, reacting with fury or physical outbursts (like throwing things) might indicate that there’s something deeper going on. Here are a few possibilities to consider:

1. **Stress or Overwhelm**: If you're under a lot of stress or feeling overwhelmed in other areas of your life, small inconveniences can feel much bigger than they are. This can lead to disproportionate reactions.

2. **Emotional Regulation Challenges**: Some people struggle with regulating their emotions, which can make it harder to manage frustration or anger in the moment. This could be due to personality traits, past experiences, or even mental health conditions.

3. **Underlying Mental Health Issues**: Conditions like anxiety, depression, or intermittent explosive disorder (IED) can lead to intense emotional outbursts. If this happens frequently, it might be worth exploring with a mental health professional.

4. **Unmet Needs or Expectations**: Sometimes, small triggers can bring up deeper feelings of frustration, disappointment, or unmet needs. For example, losing a comb might symbolize a lack of control or order in your life.

### What Can You Do?
- **Pause and Reflect**: When you feel the anger rising, try to pause and take a few deep breaths. Ask yourself why this is triggering you so intensely.
- **Practice Healthy Coping Strategies**: Techniques like mindfulness, journaling, or physical exercise can help manage stress and emotions more effectively.
- **Seek Support**: If these reactions are frequent or affecting your life, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you explore the root causes and develop strategies to manage your emotions.
- **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. It’s okay to feel upset, but it’s also important to work on healthier ways to express and process those feelings.

976,I recently lost a friend to suicide. I'm smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it. How can I handle this better?,"Suicide is a very traumatic loss and affects survivors significantly. Everyone deals with their grief in different ways. One way I recommend to deal with the loss of a loved one is to write letters to them. Some people like to keep the letters in a jar, maybe fill the jar with sand so the letters are buried. I recommend writing the letters as often as you need to. You will notice over time the need to write the letters will decrease and the intense feelings of loss will decrease. I also recommend finding a survivors support group in your area. You can find more information on www.afsp.org.","I’m deeply sorry for the loss of your friend. Losing someone to suicide is incredibly painful, and it’s understandable that you’re struggling to cope. While it’s natural to seek ways to numb the pain, relying on substances like marijuana and alcohol can make it harder to process your emotions and may lead to additional challenges in the long run. Here are some healthier ways to navigate this difficult time:

### 1. **Acknowledge Your Grief**
   - Allow yourself to feel the pain, sadness, anger, or confusion that comes with this loss. Grief is a natural process, and suppressing it can prolong the healing journey.
   - Journaling or talking to someone you trust about your feelings can help you process them.

### 2. **Seek Support**
   - Reach out to friends, family, or a therapist who can provide emotional support. You don’t have to go through this alone.
   - Consider joining a grief support group, especially one focused on suicide loss, where you can connect with others who understand your experience.

### 3. **Practice Self-Care**
   - Prioritize basic needs like eating well, sleeping, and staying hydrated. Grief can take a toll on your physical health, so taking care of your body is essential.
   - Engage in activities that bring you comfort or peace, even if it’s something small like listening to music, taking a walk, or spending time in nature.

### 4. **Find Healthy Coping Mechanisms**
   - Replace substance use with healthier ways to cope, such as exercise, meditation, or creative outlets like art, music, or writing.
   - Mindfulness practices, such as deep breathing or yoga, can help you stay grounded and manage overwhelming emotions.

### 5. **Honor Your Friend’s Memory**
   - Find meaningful ways to remember your friend, such as creating a memorial, writing them a letter, or doing something they loved.
   - Celebrating their life and the positive impact they had on you can help you find a sense of closure.

### 6. **Limit Substance Use**
   - Be mindful of how much you’re using substances to cope. While they might provide temporary relief, they can interfere with your ability to process grief and may lead to dependency.
   - If you’re struggling to cut back, consider reaching out to a counselor or support group for help.

### 7. **Be Patient with Yourself**
   - Grief is not linear, and there’s no “right” way to heal. Allow yourself the time and space to grieve without judgment.
   - Remember that it’s okay to have good days and bad days—what matters is that you’re taking steps to care for yourself.

### 8. **Consider Professional Help**
   - If you’re feeling overwhelmed, stuck, or unable to cope, a therapist or counselor can provide guidance and tools to help you navigate your grief.
   - If you’re having thoughts of self-harm or suicidal ideation, reach out to a crisis hotline or mental health professional immediately. You are not alone, and help is available.

You’re already taking a brave step by recognizing that you need to handle this differently. Healing from such a profound loss takes time, but with support and self-compassion, you can find a way to move forward while honoring your friend’s memory.

2871,"Maybe this is a stupid question, but I sometimes don't know what's real or not. If feel at times like everyone's lying. How do I know if God is one of those lies?","  It is not a stupid question, it is very basic. To help answer your question, let me begin with the premise that you will never have absolute proof. With that being said, one can look at different phenomena in nature and history and figure what is the statistical probability that they happened randomly. If one comes to the logical conclusion that many are quite improbable, then there must be a guiding force and plan.  May you be successful in your journey.","Your question is not stupid at all—it’s deeply human and reflects a desire for truth and understanding. Many people grapple with questions about faith, reality, and trust, especially in a world that can feel uncertain or overwhelming. Here are some thoughts to consider as you explore your question:

### 1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**
   - It’s okay to feel unsure or skeptical. Doubt is a natural part of the human experience, and it can even lead to deeper understanding if you approach it with curiosity and openness.
   - If you feel like everyone is lying, it might be helpful to reflect on what’s causing this distrust. Are there specific experiences or patterns that have led you to feel this way?

### 2. **Explore the Concept of God**
   - The idea of God varies across cultures, religions, and philosophies. Some see God as a personal being, others as an abstract force or principle, and some reject the concept entirely.
   - Take time to explore different perspectives. Read about various religions, philosophies, and spiritual traditions. This can help you understand how people have conceptualized God throughout history.

### 3. **Reflect on Your Own Experiences**
   - Have you ever had moments that felt meaningful, transcendent, or connected to something greater? These experiences might offer clues about what resonates with you spiritually.
   - On the other hand, if you’ve never felt such a connection, that’s okay too. Your personal experiences are valid and can guide your understanding.

### 4. **Consider the Role of Faith**
   - Faith often involves belief in something that can’t be proven empirically. For some, this is a source of comfort and purpose; for others, it feels uncertain or unconvincing.
   - Ask yourself: What do I need to believe in? What gives my life meaning? These questions can help you clarify your own values and beliefs, whether or not they involve God.

### 5. **Seek Dialogue and Support**
   - Talk to others about your questions—friends, family, spiritual leaders, or even a therapist. Hearing different perspectives can help you process your thoughts and feelings.
   - If you’re struggling with trust or feeling disconnected, consider seeking support from a counselor or support group. They can help you navigate these emotions in a healthy way.

### 6. **Be Patient with Yourself**
   - Questions about God and reality are profound and complex. It’s okay if you don’t have all the answers right now. Allow yourself the space to explore and grow at your own pace.

### 7. **Focus on What You Can Know**
   - While the existence of God may be uncertain, there are things you can know and trust in your daily life—like the love of those who care about you, the beauty of nature, or the values you hold dear.
   - Grounding yourself in these tangible truths can help you feel more secure as you explore deeper questions.

Ultimately, whether or not God is “real” is a question that each person must answer for themselves. What matters most is that you approach the question with honesty, openness, and compassion for yourself and others. Your journey to understanding is valid, and you’re not alone in seeking answers.",0.5261456370353699
564,"I feel that I need to end my present relationship. He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.","It sounds like you have some insight into the cycle that you describe with your current relationship and at the same time you are still feeling stuck. It also sounds like the distressing feelings that you experience, when you imagine what will happen for you and your current partner, are pretty overwhelming. A competent therapist may be able to help you work through these difficult thoughts and feelings and find a resolution to this cycle that will feel right to you.","It sounds like you’re in a very difficult and emotionally draining situation. You’ve clearly put a lot of thought into your relationship and your needs, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling conflicted. Here are some thoughts and steps that might help you navigate this:

### 1. **Acknowledge Your Needs**
   - You’ve identified that you want a more present and life-companion type of relationship. This is a valid and important need. If your current relationship isn’t fulfilling this, it’s worth considering whether it’s sustainable for you in the long term.

### 2. **Recognize the Cycle**
   - You’ve mentioned that you’ve gone through the cycle of breaking up and reconciling multiple times. This pattern can be emotionally exhausting and can make it harder to move forward. Recognizing this cycle is a crucial step in breaking it.

### 3. **Understand Your Anxiety**
   - The anxiety and depression you feel when thinking about him being with someone else, or about not finding someone else, are natural but intense emotions. These feelings are often rooted in fear of the unknown and fear of loneliness. It’s important to address these emotions directly, perhaps with the help of a therapist or counselor.

### 4. **Seek Support**
   - Talking to a therapist can help you work through your anxiety, depression, and the fear of being alone. They can also help you develop strategies for coping with these feelings and for making decisions that are in your best interest.

### 5. **Consider the Long-Term**
   - Think about what you want your life to look like in the next 5, 10, or 20 years. Does this relationship align with that vision? If not, it might be time to consider ending it, even though it’s painful.

### 6. **Take Small Steps**
   - If you decide to end the relationship, take it one step at a time. You don’t have to have everything figured out immediately. Allow yourself to grieve the relationship and to feel the emotions that come with it.

### 7. **Focus on Self-Care**
   - During this time, prioritize self-care. Engage in activities that bring you joy, spend time with friends and family, and take care of your physical and mental health.

### 8. **Trust in the Future**
   - It’s natural to fear that you won’t find someone else, but it’s important to remember that ending a relationship that isn’t meeting your needs opens the door to new possibilities. Trust that you can and will find someone who aligns more closely with what you want in a partner.

### 9. **Set Boundaries**
   - If you do decide to end the relationship, it might be helpful to set clear boundaries to prevent the cycle of breaking up and reconciling. This could mean limiting or cutting off contact for a period of time to allow both of you to move on.

### 10. **Reflect on the Relationship**
   - Take some time to reflect on the relationship as a whole. What have you learned from it? What do you want to carry forward into future relationships? What do you want to leave behind?

Ultimately, the decision to stay or leave is deeply personal and should be based on what you believe is best for your long-term happiness and well-being. It’s okay to feel scared and uncertain, but it’s also important to prioritize your own needs and desires. You deserve a relationship that brings you joy and fulfillment.",0.46306276321411133
812,How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,"That's a loaded question.  Typically, if we are contemplating if we should or not, it is for a reason.  To really come to a place of decision, you need to know where you are right now, what is not working, what the potential resolution would be and if it is realistic.  If you can answer those questions, you may gain some insight.   If it is realistic and your boyfriend is on the same page, seek help putting a plan in motion for resolution.  And I mention him being on the same page because if he is not, then it will never come to fruiting.  Without much other information, this is this is a solid approach.","Deciding whether to end a relationship is a deeply personal and often difficult decision. Here are some steps and considerations to help you reflect and make the best choice for yourself:

### 1. **Evaluate Your Feelings**
   - Are you happy in the relationship most of the time, or do you feel drained, unfulfilled, or unhappy?
   - Do you still feel love, respect, and connection with your boyfriend, or have those feelings faded?

### 2. **Assess the Relationship Dynamics**
   - Are your needs (emotional, physical, intellectual) being met?
   - Is there mutual respect, trust, and open communication?
   - Do you share similar values, goals, and visions for the future?

### 3. **Identify Patterns**
   - Are there recurring issues or conflicts that haven’t been resolved despite efforts?
   - Do you feel supported, or do you often feel criticized, neglected, or misunderstood?

### 4. **Consider Effort and Growth**
   - Are both of you willing to work on the relationship and grow together?
   - Have you tried to address problems through communication, counseling, or other means?

### 5. **Reflect on Your Independence**
   - Do you feel like you can be your authentic self in the relationship?
   - Are you staying because you truly want to, or out of fear, obligation, or comfort?

### 6. **Envision the Future**
   - Can you see yourself happy and fulfilled in this relationship long-term?
   - Are there deal-breakers or incompatibilities that you can’t overlook?

### 7. **Seek External Perspectives**
   - Talk to trusted friends, family, or a therapist for an outside perspective.
   - Be cautious of biases, but consider whether others have noticed issues you might be minimizing.

### 8. **Trust Your Gut**
   - Deep down, do you feel this relationship is right for you, or do you have persistent doubts?
   - Listen to your intuition, as it often knows what’s best for you.

### 9. **Take Time**
   - Don’t rush the decision. Take time to reflect, journal, or meditate on your feelings.
   - Consider taking a break if needed to gain clarity.

### 10. **Be Honest with Yourself**
   - If you’re staying out of fear of being alone, guilt, or societal pressure, those aren’t healthy reasons to remain in a relationship.
   - Remember, ending a relationship doesn’t mean you’ve failed; it can be an act of self-love and growth.

### Final Thoughts:
If you’ve tried to work on the relationship and still feel unhappy, unfulfilled, or unsupported, it may be time to consider ending it. On the other hand, if you believe the relationship is worth fighting for and both of you are committed to growth, it might be worth continuing.

2995,I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.,"The older I get, the more I believe that our real task isn't to 'find' ourselves. We're already 100% ""there."" What we do have to do is become more mindful of the times when we feel the most alive, most happy, most creative, and most fully engaged with life. It is in those moments that we find ourselves.For example, I couldn't help loving the people or things I loved, no matter who tried to talk me out of them. All I needed to do was notice when my heart opened and I felt the most alive--not because I was afraid or addicted, but because in those moments, I was in contact with my highest self. On the flip side, I needed to recognize the people and activities that consistently brought out the worst in me--the ones that made me feel controlled, constricted, dishonest, resentful, or afraid--and be honest about them. Mindfulness of ""what already is"" is the key to finding yourself. Align yourself with the people and activities that matter most to you. Don't let old habits, crappy jobs, or mean-spirited people define you. Just stumble your way forward as best you can, with greater self-awareness followed by affirmative action..   ","It’s okay to feel this way. Many people go through periods of questioning and uncertainty about their identity. Not knowing who you are can be unsettling, but it’s also an opportunity for self-discovery and growth. Here are a few thoughts and suggestions that might help:

### 1. **Be Patient with Yourself**
   - Discovering who you are is a lifelong journey, and it’s okay not to have all the answers right now. Give yourself permission to explore without pressure.

### 2. **Reflect on What You Value**
   - Think about the things that matter most to you—your beliefs, passions, and what brings you joy or fulfillment. These can offer clues about your core self.

### 3. **Explore Your Interests**
   - Try new activities, hobbies, or experiences. Sometimes, stepping outside your comfort zone can help you uncover aspects of yourself you didn’t know existed.

### 4. **Ask Yourself Questions**
   - Journaling or simply reflecting on questions like “What makes me feel alive?” or “What do I want my life to stand for?” can help you gain clarity.

### 5. **Connect with Others**
   - Talk to people who know you well or seek out communities where you feel accepted. Sometimes, others can see things in us that we can’t see in ourselves.

### 6. **Embrace the Process**
   - Identity isn’t fixed—it evolves over time. It’s okay to be a work in progress. Focus on who you are becoming rather than feeling like you need to have it all figured out.

2461,"Whenever I run into a situation that makes me upset or angry, I tend to start cursing and badly offending the person I am confronting. I say mean things to let my anger out. Whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship (like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship) I lash out not just them but at my boyfriend. I feel like I keep causing drama due to my personality. I want to be a better person and learn to let things not get to me and be happy and graceful. I hurt the ones I love with my words. I want to be better for myself and them.","Congratulations on making your way to Step One, self-observation and deciding to change a feature about how you understand and relate to others.There is extraordinary strength in being willing to notice your effect on others and consider what changes are possible.Start on the inside track of your own heart and mind.  Once you're able to understand what is driving your emotions to the point where the only reasonable way of handling them is to curse and offend people, you'd have gotten a long way in knowing your own expectations of others and how far off the mark from this in your mind, they are.For example, if you expect others to always be accepting, tolerant and happy about situations with your boyfriend, and you're hearing otherwise from people, then you can prepare yourself for possible, less than positive comments about your relationship, or you can ask people to not comment to you about your relationship at all.Basically, the more you know about yourself and are willing to accept your right to ask others to respect your views, the easier and calmer time you'll have in handling comments from others that you're not glad hearing.Also, this is a long process because you'd be trying to change long time and deep patterns of interacting.Be patient with your own learning curve and certainly consider therapy for yourself in order to have some outside guidance and support for the process you're placing yourself.","It’s really commendable that you’re reflecting on your behavior and want to make positive changes. Acknowledging the impact of your actions on yourself and others is a crucial first step toward growth. Here are some strategies to help you manage your emotions, respond more constructively, and build healthier relationships:

---

### 1. **Pause and Breathe**
   - When you feel anger rising, take a moment to pause. Deep breathing can help calm your nervous system and give you a chance to think before reacting.
   - Try counting to 10 or repeating a calming phrase like, “I can handle this calmly.”

---

### 2. **Identify Triggers**
   - Reflect on what specifically triggers your anger or frustration. Is it feeling disrespected, misunderstood, or judged? Understanding your triggers can help you prepare for how to respond in the future.

---

### 3. **Practice Self-Awareness**
   - Pay attention to the physical and emotional signs that you’re getting upset (e.g., racing heart, clenched fists, feeling defensive). Recognizing these signs early can help you intervene before you lash out.

---

### 4. **Develop Healthier Outlets for Anger**
   - Instead of directing anger at others, find constructive ways to release it. This could include journaling, exercising, or talking to a trusted friend or therapist.
   - Write down what’s upsetting you and then tear it up or burn it (safely) as a symbolic release.

---

### 5. **Communicate Assertively, Not Aggressively**
   - Learn to express your feelings without attacking others. Use “I” statements, such as, “I feel hurt when I hear rumors about my relationship,” instead of blaming or insulting.
   - Focus on the issue at hand rather than making personal attacks.

---

### 6. **Practice Empathy**
   - Try to see things from the other person’s perspective. Are they acting out of insecurity, misunderstanding, or their own pain? Empathy can help soften your anger and foster compassion.

---

### 7. **Apologize and Repair**
   - If you’ve hurt someone with your words, take responsibility and apologize sincerely. Let them know you’re working on improving and ask how you can make things right.

---

### 8. **Set Boundaries**
   - If people are spreading rumors or saying negative things, calmly set boundaries. For example, “I’d appreciate it if you wouldn’t comment on my relationship.”
   - Limit your exposure to toxic or drama-inducing people when possible.

---

### 9. **Work on Self-Esteem**
   - Sometimes lashing out stems from feeling insecure or threatened. Build your self-confidence by focusing on your strengths and practicing self-compassion.

---

### 10. **Seek Professional Support**
   - A therapist or counselor can help you explore the root causes of your anger, develop coping strategies, and improve your communication skills.

---

### 11. **Practice Gratitude and Mindfulness**
   - Cultivate a mindset of gratitude by focusing on the positive aspects of your life and relationships.
   - Mindfulness practices, such as meditation or yoga, can help you stay grounded and less reactive.

---

### 12. **Be Patient with Yourself**
   - Changing deeply ingrained habits takes time. Celebrate small victories and remind yourself that progress, not perfection, is the goal.

---

### Example Scenario:
If someone spreads a rumor about your relationship, instead of lashing out, you could say:
- **Calmly:** “I heard you’ve been saying things about my relationship. I’d appreciate it if you’d stop, as it’s hurtful and untrue.”
- **To Your Boyfriend:** “I’m feeling really upset about what’s being said, but I want to handle this in a way that doesn’t hurt us. Can we talk about it?”

By practicing these strategies consistently, you’ll gradually become more in control of your emotions and reactions. Remember, growth is a journey, and every step you take toward being the person you want to be is a step in the right direction. You’ve got this!",0.4611835479736328
