"We weren't long distance until he joined the military.  I love him and I know he loves, me but it's complicated. He said he's not going to find someone else, but I'm afraid. How do I keep our relationship going?","You're wise to be aware of possible changes to your relationship once your bf is away from you for extended time periods.All you both can do is state your intentions and wishes, keep in contact as much as possible, and wait to see how your relationship unfolds.To a large degree, each of you is relying on faith that if the relationship is meant to last for a while, then it will.   The military may add stress.This doesn't necessarily mean the stress will dissolve the relationship.Sometimes all anyone is able to do, is try.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, but a *very* common one for people with partners in the military. It's good you recognize the love is there on both sides, but the ""complicated"" part and your fears are totally valid. Here's a breakdown of how to navigate this, combining practical advice with emotional support. I'll break it down into sections: Communication, Building Trust (Especially with His Statement), Managing Your Fears, Self-Care, and Long-Term Expectations.  It's long, but this is a complex situation!

**1. Communication: The Lifeline**

*   **Scheduled Check-ins:** This is *huge*.  Military life is unpredictable.  You can't just rely on spontaneous calls. Agree on a realistic schedule for communication. This could be:
    *   **Daily Texts/Messages:** Even a quick ""thinking of you"" goes a long way.
    *   **Regular Calls/Video Chats:**  Consider time zone differences and his availability (training, duty, etc.).  ""Date nights"" via video chat can be special.
    *   **Letters/Care Packages:**  A tangible connection can be incredibly meaningful.  It shows effort and provides something to hold onto.
*   **Be Realistic:** There *will* be times when communication is limited or impossible.  Accept this upfront.  Don't take it personally when he can't respond immediately. Understanding his operational tempo is key.
*   **Be Open and Honest:** This is where the ""complicated"" part comes in.  Talk about your feelings, your fears, your needs.  Don't bottle things up.  He needs to know what's going on with you, and you need to know what's going on with him (as much as he can share).
*   **Active Listening:** When you *do* connect, really listen. Ask questions, show genuine interest in his experiences (even the mundane ones).
* **Communicate Your Love Languages:** Knowing how each of you best receives love can help bridge the distance. (Words of affirmation, acts of service, gifts, quality time, physical touch - look up ""5 Love Languages"" if you're unfamiliar).  Find ways to express love in ways he can *receive* it, even from afar.



**2. Building Trust (Addressing His ""I Won't Find Someone Else"" Statement)**

This is tricky.  His statement is meant to be reassuring, but it can also feel...almost like a preemptive defense. Here's how to approach it:

*   **Acknowledge & Validate:** ""Thank you for telling me that. It means a lot to hear you say that, and it does make me feel more secure.""  (This acknowledges his effort without immediately pressing for more).
*   **Gently Explore (Later, when you both have time and are calm):** *Don't* immediately interrogate him.  After a while, and when the timing is right, you could say something like, ""I was thinking about what you said about not finding someone else, and I appreciate you sharing that.  Is there anything that prompted you to say that?  I just want to understand where you're coming from.""  This opens the door for him to explain any anxieties *he* might be feeling.
*   **Focus on *Your* Trust:** His statement is about *his* actions.  Your trust needs to be built on his consistent behavior, honesty, and commitment to the relationship *over time*.  Look for evidence of that.
*   **Understand the Context:** Military culture can sometimes encourage this type of statement. It's not necessarily a sign of dishonesty; it could be his way of demonstrating loyalty in a setting where temptations might exist. (Not to excuse anything, but to understand the environment.)
* **Don't fish for reassurance constantly**: While it's okay to need it sometimes, continually asking ""Do you still love me?"" can create anxiety for both of you and undermine your own confidence.

**3. Managing Your Fears**

Your fear is completely understandable.  Distance changes things. Here's how to cope:

*   **Identify the Root of Your Fear:** What specifically are you afraid of? Is it infidelity? Is it him changing and growing apart from you?  Is it the uncertainty of the future?  Knowing the specific fear allows you to address it.
*   **Challenge Negative Thoughts:**  When you have a fearful thought, ask yourself: ""Is this based on fact, or is it just anxiety talking?""  ""What evidence do I have to support this fear?""  ""What's the worst that could happen, and could I cope with it?""
*   **Focus on What You *Can* Control:** You can't control his actions, but you can control your own. You can control how you spend your time",0.48042574524879456,6.056789437004879e-79,0.08557457212713936,0.24820429950091769
"I have no real friends. I have a girlfriend who irritates me but loves me to death. I push her away and pushes me away. We’re going through a breakup, and I have nobody.","Having time all to yourself may be necessary so you have time to reflect on your own identity and values, become more clear on what matters most to you, and with this increased self-understanding, be able to attract people who will feel like satisfying friends.Having a relationship with someone whom you push away and are pushed away, with someone who is irritating, seems to have limited benefit for each of you.Maybe you are together from fear of being alone, and being alone is exactly what you may now need in your life in order to draw more favorable people to you.","Okay, that sounds incredibly tough. It's a really painful situation to be in – ending a relationship *and* feeling like you have no solid support system. It's understandable you're feeling lost and probably quite lonely right now. It takes courage to even acknowledge that, so good on you for doing that. Let's break this down and think about some things.  I'll try to offer some support and potential paths forward.  This will be a longer response, because it's a complex situation.

**First, validating your feelings:**

* **It's okay to grieve:** Even if the relationship was frustrating and you were pushing each other away, it's still a loss. Grief isn't just for ""good"" breakups.  You're losing a companion, a routine, a future you imagined, and a source of connection, even a flawed one. Allow yourself to feel sad, angry, confused, whatever comes up. Don't try to suppress it.
* **It's okay to feel scared:**  Facing the void of no close friends *while* going through a breakup is terrifying.  It's natural to feel vulnerable and alone.
* **It's okay that she irritates you AND you're sad:**  Relationships are messy. It's very common to feel a mix of relief and sadness, annoyance and affection, even when ending something that isn't healthy. The fact that she loves you deeply doesn't negate your valid feelings of irritation.
* **You're not weak for feeling this way:**  Many people struggle with loneliness and difficulty forming connections. It doesn't mean there's something wrong with you.



**Let's look at the situation with your girlfriend:**

The push-pull dynamic you describe – where you both push and pull – is a sign of an unhealthy relationship pattern. It's often rooted in insecurity, fear of vulnerability, or differing needs.  Breaking up is likely the right thing, even if it hurts.  

* **No Contact (Really):**  This is *crucial* right now.  I know it's hard, especially because she loves you so much, but constant contact will just prolong the pain and prevent both of you from healing.  This includes texting, social media stalking, calling, or asking mutual friends about her.  Give both of you space to process.  It’s okay to feel the urge to reach out, but resisting it is an act of self-respect.
* **Focus on *Your* Healing:**  Instead of focusing on what she's doing or feeling, direct all your energy towards yourself.




**Now, the biggest issue:  The Lack of Friends**

This is the core of what's making this so hard, and it's what needs the most attention.  Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, and it's going to take effort and time.

* **Understand *Why* You Have No Friends:**  Be honest with yourself.  Is it:
    * **Social Anxiety?**  Do you feel uncomfortable around people?
    * **Lack of Opportunity?** Have you moved a lot?  Do you work remotely?
    * **Difficulty Initiating?**  Do you struggle to start conversations or make plans?
    * **Difficulty Maintaining?**  Do you let relationships drift?
    * **High Standards/Perfectionism?**  Are you overly critical of potential friends?
    * **Past Hurt?**  Have you been hurt by friends in the past, making you hesitant to open up?
    * **Focus on other things?** Have you been so focused on work, hobbies or relationships that you haven't made time for friendships?

    Identifying the root cause is the first step.
* **Small Steps to Connection:** Don't try to build a whole social circle overnight. That’s overwhelming. Start *small*.
    * **Reconnect with Acquaintances:**  Think about people you've enjoyed spending time with in the past – former colleagues, classmates, people you've met through hobbies.  Send a simple text: ""Hey, how are you doing? It's been a while."" Don't put pressure on it.
    * **Shared Activities:** This is the best way to form connections. Join groups or classes based on your interests:
        * **Hobbies:**  Book clubs, hiking groups, photography classes, cooking classes, sports teams (even recreational ones).
        * **Volunteering:**  A great way to meet like-minded people and do something meaningful.
        * **Work/Professional Groups:**  Networking events, industry workshops.
        * **Community Events:**  Festivals, concerts, farmers markets.
    * **Online Groups (with offline potential):**  Meetup.com is a great resource for finding local groups",0.4909672141075134,2.4275757697266645e-155,0.08489388264669165,0.23748395378690632
I feel like my time is going too fast,"Thank you for reaching out! That is a great question! As an American, I can truly say that I spend way too much time on the go! It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe! I often ask myself, what if I only had one day left on this Earth? What would I do? Well, that is an easy question. I would spend it with my family! Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World, right? Its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring.Time management is a very important factor when learning to ""live life to the fullest""! In fact, this is a required course in undergraduate college now. Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this. Personally, for myself I like to keep a calendar with a to-do list. I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list. That way, if I do not get through the list, I am not stressing over the little things. When planning your day, it is important you schedule work, eat and play. A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. There is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this, then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse/partner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there. Again, everyone has their own style on time management. I hope this was helpful for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out for anything further!","Okay, you're definitely not alone in feeling that way! It's a *very* common feeling, especially as we get older. It's like time speeds up as we go. Let's break down why you might be feeling this and, more importantly, what you can *do* about it.  I'll try to be thorough, so this might be a bit long, but hopefully helpful.  I'll categorize it into sections: **Why it feels this way, what you can do to *feel* like you have more time, and what you can do to *make* the time you have more meaningful.**

**1. Why Does Time Feel Like It's Speeding Up?**

* **The ""Proportion Theory"":** This is a popular idea. When you're young, a year is a significant portion of your life.  When you're 5, a year is 20% of your life! When you're 50, it's only 2%.  Each year feels smaller in proportion to your overall experience.
* **Habit & Routine:**  We tend to remember novel experiences more vividly.  When days blend together in routine, they don't leave as strong a mark on our memory.  Our brains essentially compress those similar days.
* **Busy-ness & Overstimulation:**  Modern life is *full*.  We're bombarded with information, tasks, and distractions.  This constant stimulation can make time feel like it's slipping through our fingers.  It's harder to be present when you're always thinking about the next thing.
* **Aging & Cognitive Changes:** As we age, our brains process information slightly differently. Some theories suggest this impacts our perception of time.
* **Focus on the Future:** Constantly planning and worrying about what's next prevents us from fully experiencing the present moment.
* **Lack of Mindfulness:**  Simply not paying attention to *how* time is passing. We're on autopilot a lot of the time.



**2.  How to *Feel* Like You Have More Time (Psychological Tricks & Practicalities)**

These won't *add* hours to the day, but they can change your *perception* of time, making it feel less rushed.

* **Mindfulness & Presence:** This is huge.  
    * **Meditation:** Even 5-10 minutes a day can make a difference. Apps like Headspace, Calm, or Insight Timer are great for beginners.  Focus on your breath, your senses, and the present moment.
    * **Single-Tasking:**  Stop multitasking! It's a myth that it's efficient.  Focus on one thing at a time, and give it your full attention. You'll likely get more done *and* feel less stressed.
    * **Sensory Engagement:** Really *experience* things.  When you're eating, savor the flavors. When you're walking, notice the sights, sounds, and smells around you.
* **Break Down Tasks:**  Large, overwhelming tasks feel like they take up a lot of time. Break them into smaller, manageable steps.  You'll feel a sense of accomplishment with each step, and the overall task will seem less daunting.
* **Time Blocking:** Schedule specific blocks of time for specific activities.  This helps you prioritize and allocate your time intentionally.  (Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, or even a paper planner can work).
* **Digital Detox:**  Limit your screen time. Social media, endless scrolling, and constant notifications are time-sucks.  Designate specific times for checking email and social media, and disconnect the rest of the time.
* **Create Rituals:**  Rituals (morning coffee, evening reading, weekend hikes) provide structure and a sense of groundedness. They can make time feel more deliberate.
* **Keep a Time Journal:** For a few days, track how you spend your time *honestly*. You might be surprised at where the hours go. This can help you identify time-wasting activities.
* **Embrace ""Slow Living"":**  Intentionally slow down your pace.  This might mean taking a longer route to work, preparing meals from scratch, or simply spending more time in nature.




**3.  How to *Make* the Time You Have More Meaningful**

This is about shifting your focus from just *having* time to *using* time in a way that aligns with your values.

* **Identify Your Priorities:** What truly matters to you?  What are your values?  Spend your time on activities that align with these.  This is *crucial*.  
* **Say ""No"" More Often:**  Protect your time by saying no to commitments that don't align with your priorities or that you simply don't have time for",0.5213494896888733,4.0132523660962505e-155,0.1359605911330049,0.2725738677417625
"He wants to wear makeup and heels. He even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina. He wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him. I have tried this for him, but I don’t like it and have told him so. He keeps making comments about it and says he can't live without it.","It sounds like you may be asking two different questions.With regard to what you said about your husband dressing as a female in your bedroom, I wonder if you would consider asking him more about this. If you choose to do that, I would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience. This can be difficult to do at times, particularly when you may want to offer your own opinions or become very anxious or of type. Consider thinking of a phrase that may help you to stay calm during the discussion. It may be helpful to think of yourself as asking questions as if you were an investigative reporter and using questions that start with words like ""what, how, who, where, when."" Questions that start with ""why,"" can be very difficult to answer for some people and can be overwhelming because it often links to answers involving emotions that may or may not be understood. Also try restating what your husband is saying to make sure that you are understanding correctly. If what he is telling you is different than what you have heard or thought of for many years, it may be challenging to follow his meaning initially. Remember that listening to your husband does not imply agreement with what he is saying, just that you are following and looking to understand what he is experiencing. I also recommend sticking to one topic for the conversation, but this could be done with many different topics over time.You could also see if he would be willing to have a discussion where he listens like an investigative reporter to learn more about the experience that you are having.As far as what you mentioned about the sexual experience, maybe if you can discuss what it is that you don't like and/or understand what it is that he does like, you could see if there is some middle ground here. It depends on what you both prefer.These types of conversations can be difficult to have for some couples, at least initially. Having structured conversations, such as the ones I've described briefly above, can feel awkward initially, but the reason it can be helpful is because it can lead to further understanding in a way that decreases the chances of having an argument.Also consider seeing a therapist in your area who specializes in couples to discuss some of these ideas.","Okay, this is a complex situation with a lot to unpack. It sounds like you're in a difficult position, feeling pressured and uncomfortable, and it's good you're reaching out. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, why it's concerning, and what you can do, focusing on your well-being and safety.  I will cover this in sections: Understanding the Situation, Your Feelings & Boundaries, His Behavior, and Seeking Help & Resources.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end as this is not a substitute for professional advice.**

**1. Understanding the Situation**

* **Gender Expression vs. Sexual Preference:**  His desire to wear makeup, heels, and tuck his genitals suggests exploration of gender expression. This is a personal journey and perfectly valid. *However*, it doesn't automatically dictate his sexual preferences or give him the right to pressure you into sexual acts you don't enjoy.  The two are separate.  He may be exploring his identity, and that's his process, but it doesn't impact your boundaries.
* **Fetish and Compulsion:** His insistence on the specific act you've described (strap-on and anal sex) and his statement ""he can't live without it"" strongly suggests this has become a central, potentially compulsive, part of his sexual desire.  This isn't necessarily *wrong* in itself, but the compulsion is problematic, especially when it disregards your feelings.
* **Power Dynamics & Control:** The fact that he continues to bring it up *after* you've clearly stated you don't like it is a red flag. It demonstrates a lack of respect for your boundaries and a potential attempt to control the sexual dynamic.
* **Potential Underlying Issues:**  His behavior *could* be linked to deeper issues like anxiety, depression, past trauma, or a poorly understood sexual identity.  It's not your job to diagnose him, but it's important to recognize that there might be more going on than simply a sexual preference.



**2. Your Feelings & Boundaries**

* **Your Feelings are Valid:**  It's *absolutely* okay that you don't enjoy this activity.  You are not obligated to do anything sexually that makes you uncomfortable, regardless of his identity or feelings. Your pleasure and comfort are just as important as his.  Don't let him make you feel guilty or selfish for expressing your needs.
* **You've Already Done the Right Thing:** You *have* communicated your boundaries by telling him you don’t like it.  The problem isn't that you haven't spoken up; it's that he's not respecting your communication.
* **Reinforce Your Boundaries:**  You need to consistently and firmly reinforce your boundaries.  ""I have told you before that I am not comfortable with this activity, and I will not be doing it.""  Avoid getting drawn into arguments or explanations beyond that.  Keep it simple and direct.
* **Self-Care is Crucial:**  This situation is emotionally draining.  Prioritize your self-care.  Spend time doing things you enjoy, connect with supportive friends and family, and focus on your own well-being.



**3. His Behavior – What's Concerning**

* **Disregard for Your Boundaries:** This is the most critical issue.  Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect and consent.  His continued pressure shows a lack of respect for you and your feelings.
* **Emotional Manipulation:**  Saying ""he can't live without it"" is a form of emotional manipulation. It's an attempt to guilt you into doing something you don't want to do by making it about his well-being instead of his desire.
* **Potential for Escalation:** If he continues to ignore your boundaries, the behavior could escalate.  It's important to be aware of this possibility and to protect yourself.
* **Unhealthy Sexual Dynamic:** This dynamic is not healthy or sustainable. It is creating resentment and discomfort, and it's unlikely to lead to a fulfilling relationship for either of you.

**4. Seeking Help & Resources**

* **Couple's Counseling (If you both want to work on the relationship):**  A therapist can provide a safe space to discuss these issues, help him understand his desires and your boundaries, and facilitate healthy communication. *However*, couple's counseling is only effective if both parties are willing to participate honestly and respectfully.  If he refuses to go or dismisses the therapist's guidance, it's unlikely to be helpful.
* **Individual Therapy for Him:**  He might benefit from individual therapy to explore his gender identity, sexual preferences, and any underlying emotional issues contributing to his behavior.
* **Individual Therapy for You:**  Talking to a therapist can help you process your feelings, develop stronger boundaries, and navigate this challenging situation. It can also",0.5467044115066528,1.0426214788922377e-78,0.14297729184188393,0.2776548149470434
"I am a really shy person. I'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?","First of all, way to go in stretching yourself out of your comfort zone! You are sure to grow through all of this practice presenting to your peers, and that in itself will help to grow your confidence over time. In the meantime, do whatever you can to help yourself feel prepared for each presentation. Do your work ahead of time so that you feel well-informed on your topic, and then spend the days leading up to your presentation practicing. Do your presentation in the mirror, while you are driving (if it won't distract you from the road), and practice in front of a friend. On the day of the presentation, eat a balanced meal, get a pep talk from a supportive friend, use deep breathing to keep your body calm, and remind yourself that you are prepared. You got this!","Okay, it's *totally* understandable that presentations are tough when you're naturally shy, especially in a demanding grad program. It's great that you're recognizing this and actively wanting to build your confidence. It's not a quick fix, but absolutely achievable with consistent effort. Here's a breakdown of strategies, broken down into preparation, during the presentation, and long-term confidence building.  I'll also categorize things by how much effort/time they take.  I'll try to give you a lot of options so you can find what resonates with you.

**I. Preparation is Key (High Effort, High Reward)**

This is where you'll get the biggest bang for your buck.  The more prepared you are, the less anxiety you'll feel.

*   **Know Your Material *Inside and Out*:** This sounds obvious, but go beyond just knowing *what* you're saying. Understand the *why*.  If you can anticipate questions, it's less stressful.
    *   **Deep Dive:**  Don't just read your notes.  Explain the concepts to a friend, family member, or even your pet.  Teaching it to someone else forces you to truly understand it.
    *   **Anticipate Questions:**  Brainstorm potential questions your audience might ask. Write out answers, even if brief. This is *huge* for calming nerves.
*   **Practice, Practice, Practice:** Seriously. This is the biggest one.
    *   **Start Small:** Don’t jump straight into a full run-through. Start by practicing just the introduction, then key sections.
    *   **Full Run-Throughs:**  Record yourself (audio or video). It's painful to watch/listen to at first, but it's incredibly helpful.  Pay attention to pacing, filler words (""um,"" ""like""), and body language.
    *   **Practice in Front of Others:**  Start with people you trust – friends, family. Then, maybe a small study group. Ask for *constructive* feedback, not just ""it was good!""  (Example: ""Was my explanation of X clear?"").
    *   **Time Yourself:** Ensure you're within the allotted time. Rushing or going over time adds to stress.
*   **Structure for Clarity (and Your Comfort):**
    *   **Detailed Outline:**  Don't write a script (unless that really helps you – some people benefit from this, but it can make you sound robotic). Instead, create a detailed outline with key points and supporting information.
    *   **Storytelling:**  Frame your presentation as a story. Stories are more engaging and easier to remember – for you *and* the audience.  This can take the pressure off memorizing facts.
    *   **Visual Aids (Well-Designed):**  Slides should *support* your presentation, not *be* your presentation.  Use images, charts, and minimal text.  Well-designed slides can act as prompts for you and reduce reliance on notes.
* **Rehearse the Space:** If possible, practice in the actual room where you'll be presenting.  Get comfortable with the layout, the podium, the technology.



**II. During the Presentation (Medium Effort, Immediate Impact)**

These are things you can do *while* you're speaking to manage anxiety and project confidence.

*   **Deep Breathing:** Before you start and during pauses, take slow, deep breaths.  This physiologically calms you down. (Box breathing - inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4 is great).
*   **Grounding Techniques:**  If you feel overwhelmed, try grounding techniques:
    *   **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    *   **Feel Your Feet:**  Focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground.
*   **Focus on Your Message, Not Yourself:**  Shift your attention from your anxiety to the information you're sharing.  You're contributing valuable knowledge.
*   **Make Eye Contact (Strategically):**  Don't scan the room frantically. Pick a few friendly faces and make brief eye contact with them.  It feels more conversational.  If eye contact is *really* difficult, look just above people's heads.  (They won't notice!)
*   **Slow Down:**  Nervousness often makes people rush. Consciously slow your pace. Pause between sentences.
*   **Embrace Imperfection:**  You *will* stumble. You *will* say ""um."" It's okay!  The",0.5172735452651978,3.4372975016158994e-155,0.11097099621689785,0.3034426361427484
"I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental.
   I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?","It is very good news that you realize the risks of smoking cigarettes while pregnant and are willing to stop.Thinking about smoking is a typical and frequent reaction to being without the substance.Be creative with what you know about yourself to distract you when this psychological urge comes up.  My suggestions are to imagine smoking if you find this would relieve the sense of wanting to smoke.Or, do the opposite and remind yourself of all the good reasons to not smoke.Also, since you're planning pregnancy then ask your partner for ideas on how to make the psychological feeling to want to smoke, feel less intense.Another suggestion is that your partner is your texting buddy to stop smoking.   With AA groups, a sponsor is always available for the alcoholic who feels distress about the urge to drink.   Having a trusted and caring person to tell about your problem helps in many situations.  Maybe it will help you to stop smoking.Good luck!","Okay, congratulations on deciding to quit for your future baby! That's a *huge* and incredibly important step, and acknowledging it's hard is also really important. You're right to identify that a lot of it is mental - that's incredibly common.  It's fantastic you're proactively looking for strategies. Here's a breakdown of approaches, focusing on the mental side, and combining them with addressing the physical.  I'll categorize them for clarity, and *please read the disclaimer at the end* as I'm not a medical professional.

**1. Understanding the Mental Addiction (and Being Kind to Yourself)**

* **Recognize the Triggers:** This is *key*.  What situations, feelings, or times of day make you *think* about smoking? Is it after a meal? When stressed? While driving?  With coffee?  Boredom?  Write these down.  Knowing your triggers lets you plan.
* **Identify the ""Routine"":**  Smoking is often deeply woven into routines.  What does your smoking ""ritual"" look like?  Do you always go outside?  Have a drink with it?  Scroll through your phone?  Breaking these associations is crucial.
* **Challenge Your Thoughts:** When you have the thought of smoking, don't just automatically act on it.  Pause.  Ask yourself:
    * ""Is this thought helpful?"" (It's definitely not!)
    * ""Is this thought true?"" (You *can* live without smoking, even if it feels impossible now.)
    * ""What's the *real* benefit of smoking right now?"" (Often, it's just temporary relief from discomfort, which can be addressed in other ways).
* **Self-Compassion:**  You *will* have slip-ups.  Seriously.  Don't beat yourself up over them.  View them as learning opportunities.  ""Okay, I had a cigarette. Why? What triggered it? What can I do differently next time?""  Shame and guilt can lead to more smoking.



**2.  Strategies to Disrupt the Mental Cycle**

* **Distraction Techniques (The ""5 D's""):**  These are your immediate go-to's when a craving hits.
    * **Delay:** Tell yourself you'll wait 10 minutes.  Often, the intensity will fade.
    * **Drink Water:**  Sip slowly. The act of drinking and the hydration help.
    * **Deep Breathe:**  Slow, deep breaths (box breathing is great: inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4) calm your nervous system.
    * **Do Something Else:**  This is where knowing your triggers comes in. If it's after a meal, get up and wash dishes *immediately*. If it's boredom, start a quick chore, listen to music, or call a friend.
    * **Discuss:**  Talk to someone about what you're feeling.
* **Mental Imagery:** Visualize yourself as a non-smoker.  Imagine how good you'll feel, how healthy you'll be, and how happy your baby will be.
* **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  Even a few minutes a day can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings *without* reacting to them.  There are tons of free guided meditation apps (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer).  Focus on the sensations in your body, your breath, and notice cravings as simply sensations, not emergencies.
* **Journaling:** Write down your thoughts and feelings about quitting.  This can help you process emotions and identify patterns.
* **Change Your Environment:**  Remove ashtrays, lighters, and anything else that reminds you of smoking.  Clean your car and house to eliminate the smell.  Avoid places where you used to smoke, at least initially.
* **Reward Yourself (Non-Smoking Rewards!):**  Set small goals (a day, a week, a month) and reward yourself with something you enjoy that *isn't* smoking.  A massage, a new book, a movie night, etc.




**3. Addressing the Physical Addiction (Important to Do Alongside Mental Strategies)**

* **Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT):**  This is *very* effective and safe for most people, *especially* when planning a pregnancy.  Talk to your doctor about:
    * **Patches:** Provide a steady dose of nicotine.
    * **Gum/Lozenges:**  Help with oral fixation and allow you to control the dose.
    * **Inhaler/Nasal Spray:**  Deliver nicotine more quickly, mimicking the feeling of smoking.
* **Prescription Medications:** Your doctor might recommend bupropion (Zyban) or varenicline (Chantix",0.5158776640892029,2.916729226408947e-155,0.12269938650306747,0.28460769138024133
"I found the guy I’m dating on dating websites. He was telling women that they were beautiful. He said it wasn’t him and that the phone was hacked. It has since happened two other times. He says he loves me and I’m the only girl he wants to be with, but I feel he is not telling me the truth.","I would suggest possibly talking about the type of relationship that both of you want to create. For example, you may want a relationship where honesty, listening, compassion, and romanticism are major parts. You could also see what your boyfriend wants.You may also consider taking five minutes to see if he will listen to your feelings about him being on the dating site and whether he can work to learn more about what you are experiencing with asking open-ended questions (not being answered with yes or no) and restating what you are saying to see if he has it right. After that, perhaps you could switch so that you can listen to his perspective for five minutes and learn more about what he is doing by asking open-ended questions.Remember that it takes two people to have  a relationship, so the choice is yours as to whether you choose to stay in the relationship and what kind of relationship you would like to have.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and your feelings of distrust are *completely* valid. This is a major red flag and it's good you're recognizing that. Let's break down why this is concerning and what you can consider doing.

**Why This Is Concerning (and why ""hacked"" doesn't hold water):**

* **Pattern, Not a One-Off:** The ""hacked"" excuse once *might* be believable, but happening *three* times is incredibly suspicious.  It's statistically improbable to have your account repeatedly compromised in that way, especially with the security measures most dating platforms have.
* **The Nature of the Action:**  Actively telling other women they are beautiful isn't something a random hacker would typically do. It's a deliberate act. Hackers usually go for financial information or to spread malware, not to give compliments.
* **Gaslighting:** He's essentially telling you what you're seeing isn't real and trying to convince you to doubt your own perception. This is a form of manipulation called gaslighting.  Even if he *believes* it's not him, the fact he defaults to a lie instead of genuine accountability is problematic.
* **Broken Trust:**  Even if you want to believe him, the repeated incidents and explanations erode the foundation of trust in the relationship. Trust is *essential* for a healthy connection.
* **Disrespectful Behavior:**  Regardless of the 'hacking' claim, the behavior itself is disrespectful to you. It implies he feels the need to seek validation from others while claiming exclusivity with you.



**What You Can Do:**

1. **Direct, Firm Conversation (Again):** You've likely already talked about this, but you need another conversation.  This time, approach it less as trying to get him to *explain* and more as stating *your feelings and boundaries*. Here's how you could phrase it:

   *  ""I need to talk about the messages you've sent to other women.  The 'hacked' explanation doesn't feel true, especially since it's happened multiple times.  It makes me feel disrespected and like my trust is being broken. I need honesty, and I'm finding it very hard to believe what you're telling me.""
   *  ""Regardless of *how* those messages were sent, the fact that they *were* sent is a problem for me. I need to know what's going on, and I need to understand why you would be communicating with other women in that way while we are dating.""
   * **Avoid getting drawn into arguing about the *hacking*.**  Focus on the *impact* on you.

2. **Observe His Reaction:** Pay *very* close attention to how he responds.
   * **Does he get defensive and blame you for not believing him?** (Red flag)
   * **Does he offer a genuine apology and take responsibility, even if he can't explain *how* it happened?** (Slightly better, but still needs follow-through - see #4)
   * **Does he try to deflect and change the subject?** (Red flag)
   * **Does he get angry or accuse you of being ""crazy"" or overreacting?** (Major red flag – this is manipulative behavior.)

3. **Consider Asking for Proof (Carefully):** This is tricky and might not be productive, but you could ask him to show you his account settings, security features enabled, and any steps he's taken to secure his accounts.  *However*,  be prepared that he may refuse, and that refusal itself is telling.  Don't get into a tech battle trying to ""prove"" it. You are not an IT expert.

4. **Set Clear Boundaries & Consequences:**  This is the most important part.  You need to decide what you're willing to accept.  Examples:

   * ""I need complete honesty and exclusivity in this relationship. If this happens again, I will need to end things.""
   * ""I cannot be in a relationship where I feel like I'm constantly questioning your honesty. I need to feel secure and respected.""
   *  ""I need you to be proactive about securing your accounts and demonstrating your commitment to our relationship.""

5. **Trust Your Gut:** This is *huge*. You are feeling a sense of unease and distrust, and you're right to listen to that. Your intuition is picking up on something.  Don't dismiss your feelings.

6. **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** This is the hardest part, but the most important. If he continues to lie, deflect, or manipulate, you need to be prepared to end the relationship. You deserve someone who is honest, respectful, and trustworthy.  Staying with someone who repeatedly breaks your trust will",0.49542632699012756,7.737567963932882e-79,0.11185682326621924,0.29837088739573686
"After I told them, they yelled at me.","It's most important that you accept yourself and surround yourself with a group of friends who are kind to you and love you. Family hearing news of any kind for the first time if they are an anxious type of character, will always be tough to digest. Time is important to let it all settle in and also making sure you're taking good care of yourself... I think you're brave and I give you a lot of credit for not denying who you are -- you will inspire so many people to do the same in your life. Wishing you all the best. Gina","Okay, that sounds really upsetting. It's awful to be yelled at, especially *after* you were brave enough to tell someone something. Here's a breakdown of how to process this, and some things to consider, broken down into sections.  I'll cover feelings, what might be happening, and what you can do.  This is a long response, because this situation deserves a thorough look.  **Please read the section at the very end about getting help if you feel unsafe.**

**1. Acknowledging Your Feelings:**

First and foremost, it's *okay* to feel however you're feeling right now. Some common reactions to being yelled at after sharing something vulnerable are:

* **Hurt:**  It's incredibly painful when someone responds to your honesty with anger.
* **Shock:** You likely weren't expecting that reaction.
* **Fear:**  You might be afraid of them, or of similar reactions in the future.
* **Anger:** You're justified in feeling angry that you were treated that way.
* **Confusion:** You might be wondering *why* they reacted like that.
* **Shame/Guilt:**  (This is *their* fault, but it's common to internalize it) You might unfairly feel like *you* did something wrong by telling them.
* **Sadness:**  A feeling of disappointment and loss, especially if it was someone you trusted.
* **Anxiety:**  Worrying about what happens next, or replaying the situation in your head.

**Don't dismiss these feelings.**  Let yourself feel them.  It's healthy to acknowledge your emotional response.  Writing down your feelings can help, or talking to a trusted friend or family member (someone *other* than the people who yelled at you).



**2. Understanding What Might Have Happened (Why They Yelled):**

Their reaction is about *them*, not about *you*. While it doesn't make it okay, understanding the possible reasons behind their behavior can help you process it. Here are some possibilities:

* **They were unprepared:**  What you told them might have been something they didn't want to hear, or weren't ready to face. They may have reacted impulsively.
* **They are dealing with their own issues:** People often lash out when they are stressed, overwhelmed, or struggling with their own problems.  It doesn't excuse their behavior, but it might explain it.
* **Poor communication skills:** Some people simply don't know *how* to respond to difficult information in a healthy way. They might resort to yelling because they lack the tools to handle the situation constructively.
* **They are trying to control you:** Yelling can be a form of intimidation and a way to exert power over someone else.  This is a red flag and potentially abusive behavior (see section 4).
* **They feel defensive:** Perhaps what you said challenged their beliefs or actions, and their anger is a way of defending themselves.
* **They lack empathy:**  They may be unable or unwilling to understand your perspective.
* **They are intentionally being hurtful:** Sadly, some people intentionally try to hurt others, and yelling is a tactic they use.

**Important:  None of these explanations *justify* their yelling at you.  It was still wrong and unacceptable.**  However, understanding the potential reasons can help you detach emotionally and avoid blaming yourself.



**3. What You Can Do Now:**

* **Create Distance:**  If possible, create some space between yourself and the people who yelled at you. You need time to process your emotions and protect yourself. This might mean physically leaving the situation, or limiting contact for a while.
* **Don't Engage (Right Now):**  Trying to reason with someone who is yelling is usually unproductive. It's likely to escalate the situation.  Wait until they are calm (and even then, you're not obligated to engage).
* **Set Boundaries (Eventually):**  Once you've had time to calm down, think about what boundaries you need to set with these people.  This could include:
    *  ""I will not tolerate being yelled at.""
    *  ""If you raise your voice at me, I will end the conversation.""
    *  ""I need you to speak to me respectfully.""
* **Write a Letter (You Don't Have to Send It):** Sometimes, writing down your thoughts and feelings can be cathartic, even if you don't share the letter.  You can express how their behavior made you feel and what you need from them in the future.
* **Focus on Self-Care:**  Do things that help you feel safe and grounded. This could include:
    *  Spending time in nature
    *  Listening to music
    *  Taking",0.47415995597839355,2.2122576942880196e-155,0.08980582524271845,0.23543990086741018
"I’ve been on 0.5 mg of Xanax twice a day for the past month. It hasn't been helping me at all, but when I take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack, it calms me down. I was wondering how I can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking I'm abusing them. I just have very big anxiety attacks. Should I stay on the 0.5mg and deal with the attacks or should I ask to up the dose? I'm afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else.","Do you think you're abusing xanax?It is a highly addictive drug so maybe one reason you feel compelled to take more is bc you already are addicted.Drugs don't do anything helpful in solving life's problems.   Once the effect wears off, the stressful situation is once again waiting for you to address it.Think over your reason for not directly asking your psychologist about upping your dose.Also, do you ever talk about your life problems with this psychologist or only your need for drugs?    The more gradual path to a better life is to not need drugs in the first place. This consists of your willingness to face the matters that are creating such terrible feelings inside you.","Okay, this is a really valid concern, and it's good you're thinking through this carefully. You're right to be worried about how your psychologist might perceive your request, given the sensitivities around benzodiazepines like Xanax. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering what to say, what to emphasize, and how to prepare for different responses.  I will also add a *very important disclaimer* at the end.

**Understanding the Situation**

* **Xanax & Tolerance:** Your experience is common.  Xanax can build tolerance quickly, meaning the same dose becomes less effective over time.  That's why 0.5mg twice a day might not be cutting it anymore, but 1mg *during* an attack still works.  This suggests it's still effective, but you need a higher baseline level in your system, or more readily available medication.
* **Psychologist's Perspective:** Your psychologist will be concerned about:
    * **Dependence:**  Benzodiazepines are habit-forming.  Increasing the dose increases that risk.
    * **Withdrawal:**  Stopping Xanax abruptly after regular use can cause unpleasant and potentially dangerous withdrawal symptoms.
    * **Underlying Issues:** They want to address the *cause* of your anxiety, not just mask the symptoms.  Medication is often seen as part of a broader treatment plan, alongside therapy.
    * **Best Practice:** Current guidelines generally recommend *against* long-term, regular use of benzodiazepines due to the risks. They'll be aware of this.
* **Your Goal:** You want relief from your anxiety attacks, and you've found Xanax *can* provide that relief, but the current dosage isn't preventative enough.



**How to Talk to Your Psychologist - A Script Framework**

Here's a way to structure the conversation.  Don't read this verbatim, but use it as a guide:

1. **Start by Acknowledging Concerns (This is crucial!)**
   * ""I wanted to talk about my Xanax dosage. I understand you're cautious about increasing it, and I appreciate that, because I know there are risks with benzodiazepines.""
   * “I’ve been reading more about anxiety management, and I understand the concerns around long-term Xanax use, which is why I want to discuss this carefully with you.”

2. **Clearly Describe Your Experience (Be Specific)**
   *  “The 0.5mg twice a day hasn’t been consistently helpful in preventing my anxiety attacks. I still experience them, and they're quite debilitating when they happen.”
   *  ""What I've noticed is that when I *do* have an attack, 1mg is effective in bringing me down.  It's not a complete fix, but it significantly reduces the intensity and duration.""
   *  Give *examples* of recent attacks.  ""Last week, during [specific situation], I had an attack that lasted for [duration] and really interfered with [activity].""

3. **State Your Request (Clearly and Reasonably)**
   * ""I'm wondering if we could discuss increasing the dosage to 1mg twice a day.  I'm hoping this might provide a more consistent level of relief and potentially reduce the frequency and severity of the attacks.""
   * **Or (alternative phrasing, if you're hesitant):** ""I'm wondering what your thoughts are on potentially adjusting the dosage, given my experience. I’m open to hearing all the options.""

4. **Emphasize Your Commitment to Therapy (Very Important)**
   * ""I'm committed to continuing therapy and addressing the root causes of my anxiety. I see the Xanax as a tool to help me function while we work on those deeper issues.""
   * ""I understand medication isn’t a long-term solution, and I'm actively working on the skills we've been discussing in therapy to manage my anxiety in the long run.""

5. **Ask About Alternatives (Shows You're Open-Minded)**
   * ""I'm also open to discussing other options if you feel increasing the Xanax isn't the best course of action.  Are there other medications or therapies we could explore?""




**What to Expect & How to Respond**

* **She Might Say No:** Be prepared for this.  She may explain her concerns and suggest sticking with the current dose and focusing on therapy, or she might suggest a different medication entirely (like an SSRI/SNRI).  *Listen* to her reasoning. Ask clarifying questions.  ""Can you help me understand the specific risks you see with increasing the dose?""
* **She Might Suggest a Trial:**  She might agree to a *short-term* trial of 1mg twice a day, with frequent check-ins to",0.5043236613273621,2.762645038775362e-155,0.08948004836759371,0.22660388463802233
We've been dating for two months now. I have a heavy past that gets him angry. Does he have a right to penalize me for things I did before I met him?,"How is he penalizing you?Have you asked for his reasons for wanting to know about your heavy past?His answers may be very different than that he would like penalizing you.What you can do is explain how pressured you feel by his questions.Ideally, the two of you will become much closer by talking openly about your respective discomforts and wishes from the other.","Okay, this is a really common and important question in relationships, and it's good you're thinking about it. Here's a breakdown of the situation, covering his feelings, your rights, and how to navigate this, broken down into sections.  It's a long answer, because it's a complex issue!

**1. Understanding His Anger (Without Excusing It)**

First, let's acknowledge *why* he might be getting angry. It's likely not about the past events themselves, but about what they *represent* to him. It could be:

*   **Broken Trust:** Even if he logically understands it happened before him, discovering a difficult past can shake his sense of trust. He's building a future with *you now*, and past actions might feel like a betrayal of the person he *thought* he knew, or a potential indicator of future behavior.
*   **Fear of Recurrence:** He might be afraid that patterns from your past will repeat themselves in the relationship. If your past involved infidelity, for example, he might be hyper-vigilant or anxious about that happening again.
*   **Feeling Deceived (If He Found Out Later):** If you didn't disclose your past upfront, he might feel hurt and like you weren't being fully honest with him.  The *way* he found out matters a lot.
*   **His Own Insecurities:** Sometimes, a partner's reaction is more about their own issues with insecurity, control, or past experiences than about what you did.
* **Discomfort with the Unknown:** A heavy past can feel like a large, unknown entity in the relationship. He may be struggling to understand it and how it impacts you and your relationship.

**It's crucial to understand that *feeling* angry is a valid human emotion. His feelings are his. However, *how he acts on that anger* is what matters.**



**2. Does He Have a Right to ""Penalize"" You?**

This is the core of your question, and the answer is **no, not really.**  ""Penalize"" implies holding your past actions against you *now* in a way that is unfair or controlling. Here's why:

*   **You Weren't His Responsibility Then:** You were a different person, in a different context, making different choices. He wasn't there to influence those choices.  Holding you accountable *now* for something that happened then is fundamentally unfair.
*   **People Change and Grow:** Everyone makes mistakes.  People learn from them, and they evolve.  If you've done the work to address your past, he should acknowledge that.
*   **Focus on the Present Relationship:** A healthy relationship is built on the foundation of who you are *now* – your current behavior, values, and commitment to each other.  Dwelling excessively on the past undermines that foundation.
*   **Controlling Behavior:** ""Penalizing"" you can quickly slip into controlling behavior. This could look like constantly bringing up the past during arguments, withholding affection, or making you feel like you're always walking on eggshells.  That's not healthy.

**What *is* reasonable:** He has a right to:

*   **Ask Questions:**  He's allowed to ask about your past to understand you better, *especially* if it directly impacts the relationship.
*   **Express His Feelings:** He can say, ""I'm struggling with this information,"" or ""I feel a little insecure when I think about this.""
*   **Set Boundaries:** He can say, ""I need some time to process this,"" or ""I need reassurance in certain areas.""  (But boundaries should be about protecting *himself*, not controlling *you*.)
* **To assess compatibility:** He has a right to decide if your past is something he can navigate with you, and if the relationship is a good fit.



**3. What Does ""Addressing Your Past"" Look Like?**

Before we go further, let's clarify what it means to have ""addressed"" your past. It's not just about saying ""I'm sorry.""  It involves:

*   **Taking Responsibility:** Acknowledging your role in what happened, without making excuses.
*   **Understanding the Root Causes:**  Exploring *why* you made those choices.  (Therapy is incredibly helpful here.)
*   **Making Amends (Where Possible):**  If you hurt someone, have you attempted to make amends?
*   **Changing Your Behavior:**  Demonstrating through your actions that you've learned and grown.
*   **Self-Forgiveness:**  While not forgetting, learning to forgive yourself is crucial for moving forward. (This is also something therapy can help with.)

Every winter I find myself getting sad because of the weather.  How can I fight this?,"Sometimes its quite literally the lack of sunshine that can affect our mood - in these cases it can be worth experimenting with a sun lamp, to boost your dose of vitamin D, when the sun isn't naturally out. Also consider, what is it that the change in weather, changes in your life? If for example, when its sunny you are an outdoorsy, active person and when the weather changes, you're whole activity level changes along with it, you could explore how to get some of that activity replicated indoors in the winter months.","Okay, it's super common to feel down during the winter months! It's often referred to as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) or just the ""winter blues."" It's good you're recognizing it and wanting to do something about it. Here's a breakdown of things you can try, ranging from simple lifestyle adjustments to things you might discuss with a doctor. I'll categorize them for clarity.  I'll also add a ""Level of Effort"" scale (Low, Medium, High) to give you an idea of how much work each suggestion might be.

**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. If your sadness is severe, interfering with your daily life, or you are having thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out to a mental health professional or crisis hotline (numbers at the end of this response).



**I. Light & Environment (Low - Medium Effort)**

*   **Light Therapy:**  This is often the *first line of defense* for SAD.  A light therapy box emits bright, full-spectrum light that mimics sunlight. You sit in front of it for a specific amount of time each day (usually 20-30 minutes) during the winter.  *Important:* Talk to your doctor before starting light therapy, especially if you have any eye conditions or are on certain medications. (Effort: Medium - cost of box, daily commitment)
*   **Maximize Natural Light:** Open curtains and blinds as soon as it's light. Sit near windows when possible. Even on cloudy days, there's *some* light getting through. (Effort: Low)
*   **Brighten Your Space:** Use brighter light bulbs in your home, especially in rooms where you spend a lot of time. Consider a ""daylight"" bulb.  (Effort: Low)
*   **Color Therapy (a bit of a boost):** Surround yourself with cheerful colors. Add colorful throws, pillows, artwork, or even paint an accent wall. (Effort: Low)
*   **Declutter:** A cluttered space can contribute to a feeling of being weighed down. (Effort: Medium - can be overwhelming for some)



**II. Lifestyle & Self-Care (Low - Medium Effort)**

*   **Stay Active:** Exercise is a *huge* mood booster.  Even a 20-30 minute walk can make a difference. If it's too cold or dark to go outside, find indoor activities you enjoy – dancing, yoga, gym, etc. (Effort: Medium - requires discipline)
*   **Maintain a Routine:**  When the days are shorter and darker, it's easy to let routines slide.  Try to stick to regular sleep and wake times, meal times, and activities. (Effort: Low - Medium)
*   **Healthy Diet:**  Focus on a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  Avoid excessive sugar and processed foods, which can lead to energy crashes and mood swings. Vitamin D is especially important in winter (see ""Supplements"" below). (Effort: Medium)
*   **Stay Socially Connected:**  Isolation can worsen SAD.  Make an effort to connect with friends and family, even if it's just a phone call or video chat.  Plan social activities. (Effort: Low - Medium)
*   **Engage in Hobbies:**  Do things you enjoy! Read, listen to music, paint, knit, cook, bake, play games – whatever makes you happy.  (Effort: Low)
*   **Practice Mindfulness & Relaxation:**  Stress can exacerbate SAD.  Try meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga to calm your mind. There are many free apps available (Headspace, Calm, etc.). (Effort: Low - Medium)
*   **Prioritize Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night.  Create a relaxing bedtime routine. (Effort: Low - Medium)
*   **Plan Something to Look Forward To:** Having a vacation, event, or even a small treat scheduled can give you something positive to anticipate. (Effort: Low)

**III. Supplements & Nutrition (Low - Medium Effort - *Consult your Doctor First!*)**

*   **Vitamin D:** Many people are deficient in Vitamin D, especially during the winter months when sun exposure is limited.  Talk to your doctor about getting your Vitamin D levels checked and whether supplementation is right for you. (Effort: Low - Medium - requires doctor visit & daily supplement)
*   **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Found in fatty fish, flaxseed, and walnuts, these can support brain health and mood. (Effort: Low - Medium)
*   **Magnesium:**  Plays a role in mood regulation. (Effort: Low - Medium)
    * *Always discuss supplements",0.48040661215782166,3.969901054374602e-79,0.08168642951251645,0.25218765192027226
"I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental.

I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?","Hi. Good for you in planning ahead to do what's healthiest for your baby (and yourself). That's a great first step! It's also good that you are able to identify that it's not always a physical need that's driving the addiction.For the next steps, I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological (or mental) cravings are usually based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if you're consciously trying to quit, you'll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. Well, if I'm on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually I'll give in and eat it.You're going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. That's normal and, for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. That's what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it (""Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now.""), but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.I've suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they're going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.Best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby!","Okay, you're incredibly brave to recognize this and proactively address it *before* starting a family. That's a huge step, and acknowledging the mental side of the addiction is really important – you're right, it's often more than just physical! It's amazing you're already aware that the thoughts themselves are a big trigger. Here's a breakdown of strategies, geared towards the mental/emotional aspects, and practical things to do, broken down into sections.  I'll also include a *very important disclaimer* at the end.

**1. Understanding the Mental Addiction - What's Going On?**

* **Habit Loops:** Smoking is often tied to routines and feelings. Think about *when* you smoke. Is it with coffee? After meals? When stressed? When bored? When socializing?  These are habit loops – cue, routine, reward.  Breaking these requires identifying the cues and changing the routine.
* **Emotional Connection:**  You've likely associated smoking with managing emotions – stress relief, calming anxiety, even just a moment of peace.  That's a powerful link. The craving isn’t necessarily for nicotine, but for *that feeling* you associate with smoking.
* **Thought Patterns:** The very *thought* of smoking releases dopamine, even without the act itself.  This reinforces the craving. It's like your brain is getting a little ""reward"" for just *thinking* about it.
* **Fear of Withdrawal (even mental):**  You might be unconsciously fearing the discomfort of withdrawal, even if it's just feeling irritable or restless.



**2. Strategies to Tackle the Mental Addiction**

* **Thought Stopping & Reframing:** This is *huge*.
    * **Thought Stopping:** When you have a thought about smoking, immediately say ""STOP!"" (either out loud or in your head).  Visualize a stop sign, or snap a rubber band on your wrist (gently!). The goal is to interrupt the thought pattern.
    * **Reframing:**  After stopping the thought, *replace* it with a positive thought. Examples:
        * ""I am strong and I can do this for my baby.""
        * ""I deserve to be healthy.""
        * ""This craving will pass.""
        * ""I'm choosing health and happiness over a temporary fix.""
        * ""I'm building a better future for my child.""
* **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  This helps you become aware of your thoughts *without* getting carried away by them.
    * **Craving Surfing:**  Imagine a craving as a wave.  It builds, peaks, and then subsides.  Just observe it without acting on it.  Notice the physical sensations, the thoughts, and acknowledge them, but don’t fight them.  Let the wave pass. (There are guided meditations specifically for craving surfing).
    * **Daily Meditation:** Even 5-10 minutes a day can help you develop a more detached relationship with your thoughts.
* **Visualization:**  Regularly visualize yourself as a non-smoker. Imagine how good you'll feel, how healthy you'll be, and how happy your baby will be.  Make it vivid and detailed.
* **Journaling:** Write down your thoughts and feelings about smoking. Explore *why* you smoke, what triggers you, and how you feel when you have cravings. This can bring unconscious patterns to light.
* **Identify and Challenge Beliefs:** What do you *believe* about smoking?  ""It helps me relax?"" ""I need it to cope with stress?"" Challenge these beliefs. Are they truly true? Are there other ways to relax or cope?

**3.  Practical Strategies & Replacement Behaviors**

* **Identify Your Triggers:**  Make a list of situations, places, people, and emotions that make you want to smoke.  Once you know them, you can plan ahead.
* **Change Your Routine:** If you always smoke with coffee, switch to tea. If you smoke after meals, go for a walk. Disrupt the habit loops.
* **Distraction Techniques:** When a craving hits:
    * **The 4 D's:** Delay (wait 10-15 minutes, cravings often fade), Deep Breathe (slow, deep breaths), Drink Water, Do Something Else.
    * **Engage Your Senses:**  Listen to music, smell a pleasant scent (lavender, citrus), take a warm bath, chew gum, eat a healthy snack (fruit, vegetables).
    * **Physical Activity:** Exercise is fantastic for stress relief and can distract you.
    * **Call a Friend:**  Talk to someone supportive.
* **Create a Smoke-Free Zone:**  Make your home and car smoke-free.
* **Reward Yourself (non-smoking related):**  Set",0.5612903237342834,9.677989484715536e-79,0.15384615384615385,0.3144841113238833
"I'm transgender, I know I am, but I've only told a few friends. I know I can't tell my family because of previous conversations we've had. They just wouldn't accept it.
My gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own. I need some strategies for dealing with it. What should I do?","Hello, and thank you for your question. I am so glad that you reached out for help. I know that the dysphoria can feel nearly impossible to handle, especially since you have limited support from people who accept who you are. You may already know some of these resources, but I am going to share a few. 1. The website www.letsqueerthingsup.com is a blog from a very good writer that I know. His name is Sam Dylan Finch, and he is transgender. He writes about mental health, transgender issues, and many other topics. I know he has frequently written about gender dysphoria and ways to manage it. You may want to check out his site and do a search on there. 2. The website www.everydayfeminism.com employs many transgender writers and several have written about gender dysphoria and have given ideas for managing it. If you search for gender dysphoria on their site, many articles pop up. It may be a good resource for you, especially if you ever feel lonely and start to forget that there are others out there who are like you and have your back. 3. I am not sure where you live, but there are counselors who specialize in affirmative therapy, which is what is recommended for folks who are part of the LGBTQ community. So, if you decide to see a counselor about the dysphoria, try to find one that specifically says they have been trained in the affirmative approach. In addition, feel free to ask questions of the counselor before agreeing to see them for counseling. An ethical counselor would have no problem answering them before having you come in. 4. If there are some LGBTQ resource centers in your area, try to reach out to them and see if there are support groups. Gaining more support from others would be helpful. Sometimes LGBTQ-friendly counselors leave their contact information for people in resource centers. 5. Finally, I know you have not mentioned being depressed or suicidal, but I also know that it is very common for people to consider suicide when they are struggling with dysphoria, dealing with transphobia, etc. If this ever happens to you, please call 911 or the Trans Lifeline. It's free at 877-565-8860. Visit their site at www.translifeline.org. I hope some of these ideas help. Feel free to send another message if you have a follow-up question.Be well....be YOU.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC ","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge what you're going through and to reach out for help, even in this anonymous way. It's completely understandable that you're struggling with dysphoria, especially when you feel you can't be open with your family.  Here's a breakdown of strategies, broken down into categories, to help you cope, focusing on safety and self-care.  I'll also include resources at the end.  **Please read the disclaimer at the very end, as this is not a substitute for professional help.**

**1. Self-Soothing & Grounding Techniques (For Immediate Relief)**

These are things you can do *in the moment* when dysphoria is peaking.  Think of them as a first-aid kit for your feelings.

*   **Grounding Exercises:** These help bring you back to the present moment.
    *   **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    *   **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system.  Try box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4).
    *   **Physical Sensations:** Hold an ice cube, take a warm shower, pet an animal, or wrap yourself in a blanket. Focus on the *feeling* of the sensation.
*   **Distraction (Healthy Distraction):**  This isn't about ignoring your feelings forever, but about giving yourself a break when they become overwhelming.
    *   **Hobbies:**  Engage in something you enjoy – reading, art, music, gaming, cooking, etc.
    *   **Mindful Activities:**  Coloring, puzzles, knitting, or anything that requires focused attention.
    *   **Watch Something Comforting:** A favorite movie or TV show.
*   **Affirmations:**  Even if you don't fully *believe* them yet, repeating positive statements can help challenge negative self-talk. Examples: ""I am valid,"" ""My feelings are real,"" ""I deserve to be happy,"" ""I am worthy of respect.""
*   **Journaling:**  Writing down your feelings can be incredibly cathartic.  You don't have to write perfectly, just get your thoughts out.

**2.  Safe Exploration of Gender Expression (Within Your Boundaries)**

This is about finding ways to feel more aligned with your gender *safely*, given your family situation.  This will look different for everyone.

*   **Clothing:**  Experiment with clothing that feels more authentic to you, even if it's just in your room or when you're with supportive friends.  Thrift stores can be a great, low-pressure place to explore.
*   **Hair:**  Experiment with hairstyles.
*   **Makeup/Grooming:**  If these feel right for you, practice them when you have privacy.
*   **Name/Pronouns (with trusted friends):**  Using your preferred name and pronouns with your friends is a powerful affirmation.
*   **Online Spaces:**  Creating an online persona where you can express your gender freely can be incredibly validating. (Be mindful of online safety, of course – see resources below).
*   **Voice Training (if desired):** There are many free online resources for voice feminization or masculinization. (Again, do this in private if needed).

**3. Building Your Support System**

You've already taken a great step by confiding in friends.  Expanding that support is crucial.

*   **Lean on Your Friends:**  Talk to them about how you're feeling, and let them support you. Don't be afraid to ask for what you need.
*   **Find Online Communities:**  There are countless online forums, Discord servers, and social media groups for transgender and non-binary people.  This can be a lifeline.  (See resources below).
*   **LGBTQ+ Centers:**  Even if you can't access in-person services, many LGBTQ+ centers offer online support groups and resources.
*   **Consider a Therapist (if possible):** A therapist specializing in gender identity can provide a safe and confidential space to explore your feelings and develop coping mechanisms.  (See resources below for finding affordable options).

**4.  Managing Family Interactions**

This is the hardest part, given your situation.

*   **Grey Rocking:**  This is a technique where you become emotionally unresponsive to your family's negativity. You answer questions with brief, neutral statements.  The goal is to discourage them from engaging in triggering conversations.  (Example:  ""How was your",0.5262351632118225,1.0422979437645458e-78,0.13075506445672191,0.278352374243285
"Whenever I leave my girlfriend I get panic attacks. I'm taking medications to control them, but I'm thinking of moving in with her since I get so anxious.","I’m sorry to hear that you are currently experiencing panic attacks. I hope that the medication you have been prescribed has provided you with some relief. Unfortunately, I don’t feel that moving in with your girlfriend would alleviate your anxiety. Although you may feel very anxious about leaving her, your body is reacting to this stressful event in your life in an unhealthy manner. You may be able to render this particular situation but it’s likely that you may experience another panic attack when an additional stressful event arises. Therefore, it is essential that you address the reason for why you are experiencing panic attacks in the first place followed by practicing coping mechanisms in the case that one would arise in the future.Talk therapy has shown to be effective with those affected by anxiety along with breathing exercises and yoga. A trained therapist will be able to assist you in finding the right stress reducing method so that you can reduce the chance of another attack occurring.I wish you the best of luck! It sounds like you are very happy in your relationship and I hope you are able to reduce your anxiety so that you are able to enjoy one another.","Okay, this is a really important and complex situation, and it's good you're thinking it through. It's also good you're already addressing the panic attacks with medication – that's a really positive first step. Let's break down the thoughts and feelings here, and look at this from a few angles.  I'm going to give a fairly detailed response, covering a lot of considerations.  Because this involves mental health and a significant relationship decision, **please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is not a substitute for professional advice.**

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **You're Experiencing Separation Anxiety:** What you're describing sounds very much like separation anxiety. It's not uncommon, and it's often more intense than people realize. It's not just ""missing someone,"" it's a genuine fear and panic response triggered by being apart.  It's great that you've identified this as being linked to leaving your girlfriend.
* **The Medication is Managing Symptoms, Not Addressing the Root Cause:** Medication is *helpful* in controlling the panic attacks, but it's generally not a *cure*. It's managing the *symptoms* of the underlying anxiety.  You need to address *why* you're feeling this anxiety in the first place.
* **Moving In Is a Potential Avoidance Strategy:**  This is the core of what we need to discuss. Moving in together to *avoid* panic attacks is a very different reason than moving in because the relationship is ready for that step.  Avoidance can provide short-term relief, but it can actually *worsen* anxiety in the long run. It reinforces the idea that being apart is dangerous or unbearable.
* **Potential for Codependency:** While not necessarily the case, consistently structuring your life around avoiding your anxiety could inadvertently foster codependent patterns in the relationship. This isn't about blaming anyone, but recognizing a dynamic where your well-being becomes overly reliant on her presence.



**Why Moving In *Might* Not Be the Best Solution (Right Now)**

* **It Masks the Problem:** If the anxiety isn't addressed, it will likely manifest in other ways, even *while* living together.  It might show up as irritability, difficulty with individual hobbies, or a feeling of being ""suffocated"" even with constant proximity.
* **Increased Pressure on the Relationship:**  Moving in is a big step, and it adds new layers of complexity to any relationship.  Adding the pressure of *also* being the solution to your anxiety could be unfair to both of you.  The relationship should be able to stand on its own, independent of managing your panic.
* **Loss of Independence:**  Both individuals need to maintain a sense of self and independence within a relationship. Constant togetherness, driven by anxiety, can erode that.
* **Difficulty Identifying Your Own Needs:**  If you're constantly seeking reassurance and proximity, it can become harder to identify what *you* truly want and need, separate from your fear of being alone.
* **What happens if you *have* to be apart?**  Life inevitably involves separation - work trips, family emergencies, even just needing personal space. If the panic is tied to any separation, moving in doesn’t solve that and could create bigger problems down the road.

**What You Should Do Instead (or Alongside Moving In Considerations)**

1. **Therapy is Crucial:** This is the *most* important step.  Find a therapist specializing in anxiety disorders, ideally one with experience in separation anxiety.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is often very effective for panic attacks and anxiety.  Therapy can help you:
    * **Identify the Root Causes:**  Explore *why* you experience this anxiety.  Is it related to past experiences?  Attachment style? Fears of abandonment?
    * **Develop Coping Mechanisms:** Learn techniques to manage your anxiety *without* relying on proximity to your girlfriend.  This could include breathing exercises, mindfulness, grounding techniques, and cognitive restructuring (challenging anxious thoughts).
    * **Gradual Exposure:**  A therapist can guide you through a process of gradually increasing your tolerance for being apart, starting with small steps and building up over time.  This is key to breaking the cycle of avoidance.
    * **Address Underlying Issues:**  There may be other emotional factors contributing to your anxiety that need to be addressed.

2. **Communicate Openly with Your Girlfriend:**  Talk to her about what you're experiencing, and *why* you're considering moving in. Be honest about the fact that it's partially driven by your anxiety, and that you're committed to addressing the anxiety through therapy.  She needs to understand this isn't about solely wanting to be with her, but about a deeper issue you're working on.

**1. Self-Help Strategies – Building a Foundation**

These are things you can build into your daily or weekly routine. They may seem small, but consistently doing them can make a significant difference.

*   **Routine & Structure:**  Depression often thrives in chaos.  Even if you don't *feel* like it, try to establish a simple daily routine.  This could include:
    *   Waking up at a similar time each day (even weekends).
    *   Scheduled mealtimes.
    *   Dedicated time for work/study/chores.
    *   A consistent bedtime.
*   **Physical Activity:**  This is *hugely* important, even if it's just a little. Exercise releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects.
    *   **Start small:** A 10-15 minute walk.  Dancing to music in your room.  Stretching.
    *   **Find something you (slightly) enjoy:**  It doesn’t have to be a grueling workout.
    *   **Consistency is key:**  Aim for something most days of the week.
*   **Healthy Diet:**  What you eat impacts your mood.
    *   **Focus on whole foods:** Fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains.
    *   **Limit processed foods, sugar, and excessive caffeine/alcohol:** These can worsen mood swings.
    *   **Stay hydrated:** Drink plenty of water.
*   **Sleep Hygiene:**  Poor sleep can exacerbate depression.
    *   **Regular Sleep Schedule:** (mentioned above in routine).
    *   **Relaxing Bedtime Routine:**  Warm bath, reading (not on a screen!), calming music.
    *   **Optimize Your Sleep Environment:** Dark, quiet, and cool room.
*   **Mindfulness & Relaxation Techniques:**  These can help you manage stress and anxiety, which often accompany depression.
    *   **Deep Breathing Exercises:**  Plenty of free guided breathing exercises are available on YouTube or apps (see Resources below).
    *   **Meditation:**  Start with short guided meditations (5-10 minutes). Apps like Headspace, Calm, or Insight Timer are great.
    *   **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:**  Tense and release different muscle groups to reduce tension.
    *   **Grounding Techniques:**  If you're feeling overwhelmed, try the 5-4-3-2-1 method: Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
* **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a great way to process them.  You don't have to write perfectly, just get things *out*.  No one needs to read it.

"I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.
I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. While your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard. Talk to them during a non-emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as ""you NEVER listen,"" ""you ALWAYS say..."" and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with ""you"" try using ""I"" by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist, teacher, or school counselor if possible. Most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help.Best of luck to you.","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult and isolating. It's really brave of you to articulate all of this – it takes strength to admit when you're hurting and feeling alone. It’s completely understandable why you're feeling overwhelmed with stress and anxiety given the situation you've described. Let's break this down and explore some ways to approach these challenges.

**First, validating your feelings:**

* **Your feelings are *completely* valid.** Feeling unheard, unsupported, and distrusted by both your parents *and* friends is deeply painful.  It's okay to grieve the childhood you feel you missed and the relationships you wish you had.
* **It's not selfish to need support.** You are a good person for being there for your friends, but you deserve that same support in return.  It's not about keeping score, but about reciprocal care in a friendship.
* **Your identity is important.**  Being pansexual is a part of who you are, and wanting to share that with your parents, and to have them accept and understand, is a fundamental need.  It’s incredibly disheartening when that's met with disbelief or dismissal.
* **Overcoming depression is a huge accomplishment.** You’ve already shown incredible resilience. That strength is *still* within you, even when you feel exhausted and overwhelmed.



**Let's look at each part of this, and then talk about potential next steps:**

**1. Your Parents & Lack of Trust:**

This is the core issue, and it's a tough one, especially given their age and established patterns.  It's likely their behavior is deeply ingrained.  Here's what's happening:

* **Invalidation:** When your dad dismisses you, and your mom follows suit, it's a form of emotional invalidation. This is incredibly damaging because it tells you your feelings and experiences aren't important or real.
* **Generational Differences:** Sometimes, older generations struggle with understanding concepts like pansexuality due to different cultural norms and limited exposure. This doesn’t excuse their reaction, but it might offer *some* context.
* **Power Dynamic:**  The parent-child dynamic, especially with a teenager, can sometimes be about control.  Dismissing your experiences might be their (unhealthy) way of maintaining control.
* **Communication Styles:** Some families simply don’t *know* how to have open, vulnerable conversations.

**What can you *try* (understanding it may not work, and that's okay):**

* **Choose Your Battles:**  You might need to accept that you can't force them to understand everything.  Focus on sharing information when it feels *safe* and when you're prepared for a potentially negative reaction.
* **""I Feel"" Statements:** Instead of saying ""You never believe me,"" try ""I feel hurt and dismissed when my experiences are questioned."" This focuses on *your* feelings, which is harder to dismiss.
* **Written Communication:**  Sometimes, writing a letter or email can be easier than a face-to-face conversation.  It allows you to carefully articulate your thoughts and gives them time to process.  (Be prepared for them to not respond well even to this.)
* **Lower Expectations:** This is hard, but it might protect you.  If you consistently expect them to be dismissive, it will hurt less when they are.
* **Acceptance (for *your* sake):** Accepting that they *may not* be the emotionally supportive parents you need can be painful, but it frees you to seek support elsewhere.

**2. Friendships & Lack of Reciprocity:**

It's draining to always be the supporter and not receive that in return.

* **Unbalanced Dynamics:** Healthy friendships are about give and take.  If you're consistently giving and not receiving, it's an unbalanced dynamic.
* **Their Capacity:** Your friends might be going through their own struggles and genuinely lack the emotional bandwidth to support you right now. This doesn't excuse their lack of support, but it might explain it.
* **Communication:** Have you directly told your friends what you need? Sometimes people don't realize you're struggling unless you tell them.

**What can you try:**

* **Direct Communication:**  “Hey, I’ve been really struggling lately, and it would mean a lot to me if you could just listen without offering advice right now.”  Or, ""I'm here for you when you need to talk, and I'm hoping you can be there for me too.""
* **Observe Patterns:** Are there certain friends who are consistently less supportive?  You might need to adjust your expectations for those relationships.
* **Expand Your Circle:**  Don’t rely on just a few friends for all your emotional needs.  Try to meet new people through hobbies,",0.5259455442428589,0.024144595890224916,0.13293650793650794,0.28839922229423204
"My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the ""straight and narrow"" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that I'm not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others.    His insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","You might ask your fiance about people who have let him down in the past; past hurts from parents, friends, people he has dated. If you are speaking about jealousy he may come from a divorced parent upbringing, may have seen parents cheat on one or the other, may have had partners cheat on him in the past.  He may have fears that you may go off the ""straight and narrow"" once you get married. Listen to any concerns with patience and understanding, avoid being defensive. I would highly encourage pre-marital counseling to explore these things and individual counseling for himself to work on fears and anxieties. If he refuses and things do not improve I would consider postponing the wedding, things will not get better once you get married, only magnified.  Finally show him Bible passages about forgiveness and worry and leaning on God with faith and hope for the future.    God bless.","Okay, this is a really common and deeply sensitive issue, especially within a Christian framework where premarital purity is often emphasized. It's good you're recognizing this pattern of insecurity in him, as that's key to addressing it. Here's a breakdown of how you can approach this, broken down into sections.  It's going to require patience, honesty, and potentially professional guidance.  I'll also include a section on setting boundaries because your well-being is paramount.

**1. Understanding the Roots of His Struggle**

* **His Own Past:** You mentioned he also went ""off the straight and narrow.""  His difficulty with *your* past could be a projection of his own guilt, shame, or regret. He might be judging you based on standards he’s not fully meeting himself, and that's incredibly uncomfortable.  He may be wrestling with his own choices and finding it easier to focus on yours than to confront his own.
* **Religious Teachings (and Interpretation):** The way he was taught about sex and purity likely plays a massive role.  Some interpretations are very rigid and unforgiving. It’s crucial to understand *his* specific understanding of those teachings. Is he holding onto a legalistic view, or a more grace-based one?
* **Insecurity & Control:**  His inability to accept others *in general* points to deeper insecurities. Sometimes, trying to control a partner’s past (which is unchangeable) is a way to feel more secure in the present. He might be fearing future infidelity or feeling inadequate if he perceives your past as ""more experienced.""
* **Shame & Vulnerability:**  Talking about these things requires vulnerability, and that can be scary. He might be shielding himself by focusing on you, avoiding his own internal work.



**2. Communication Strategies: Approaching the Conversation**

* **Choose the Right Time & Place:** *Never* try to have this conversation during an argument.  Pick a calm, private setting where you both feel safe and relaxed.  Avoid distractions.
* **""I Feel"" Statements:** This is *crucial*. Instead of saying ""You make me feel bad when you..."", say ""I feel hurt and discouraged when my past is brought up."" Focus on your feelings, not his actions.
* **Empathy, But Not Apology:**  You can *empathize* with his struggle (""I understand this is difficult for you, given your beliefs...""). But *do not apologize* for your past.  You are not wrong for being human and making choices.  Apologizing reinforces the idea that your past is something to be ashamed of.
* **Focus on the Present & Future:** Gently steer the conversation towards your commitment to *each other* now. ""What matters to me is our relationship *now* and building a future together. My past doesn't define who I am today.""
* **Ask Open-Ended Questions:**  Instead of accusing (""Why can't you let this go?""), try ""What specifically about my past is hardest for you to accept?"" or ""What are your fears about our future together?""  Listen actively to his response *without interrupting* (as much as possible).
* **Shared Values:** Remind him of the values you *do* share—love, commitment, forgiveness, a desire to build a life together within your faith.
* **Be Firm but Kind:** You can be understanding while still firmly stating your boundaries (see section 4).




**3. Addressing the Religious Aspect**

* **Grace & Forgiveness:** If you both are genuinely committed to your Christian faith, emphasize the concepts of grace, forgiveness, and new beginnings.  Discuss how God offers forgiveness and the opportunity for a fresh start.  (Romans 3:23-24, 1 John 1:9 are relevant verses).
* **Different Interpretations:** It's okay to acknowledge that people have different interpretations of scripture.  You don’t have to agree on everything, but you need to be able to discuss differences respectfully.
* **Counseling (Pastoral or Christian):**  Consider couples counseling with a pastor or Christian counselor who is experienced in these issues.  A neutral third party can help facilitate a healthy dialogue and offer guidance rooted in your faith. *This is a really strong recommendation.*  A good counselor can help him work through his own issues and understand a more balanced theological perspective.
* **Focus on Redemption:** Frame your past not as a stain, but as a part of your journey that has brought you to where you are today – a person who is now choosing him and committed to a loving relationship.




**4. Setting Boundaries (This is VITAL)**

This is the hardest part, but the most important for your emotional well-being.

* **Limit Dwelling on the Past:** ""I’m happy to talk about this once, to",0.5102061033248901,0.012251866401688127,0.09608938547486033,0.25000000000000006
My fiancé and I broke up. He cheated on me numerous times. I kept forgiving but questioning his every move. He got tired and left.,"Cheating on you shows a lack of commitment, in addition to the emotional hurt it creates.Probably you didn't actually forgive him because if you did, then you wouldn't have been asking questions of his every move.Maybe you were open to forgiving him.   In order for forgiveness to be effective, the person who has done the injuring must first show some understanding and empathy for the great pain the person caused in you.From what you write, your fiancé didn't seem to have much interest in earning back your trust or in empathizing with the way his cheating effected you.It is very likely his tiredness is also tiredness you feel, of having to watch him all the time.As uncomfortable as adjusting with the disappointment of him leaving you, the situation you describe sounds like it was unsatisfying for both of you.","Okay, this is incredibly painful, and I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's a really tough situation, and it sounds like you've been carrying a lot of hurt for a long time. It's completely understandable that you're feeling a mix of emotions right now - grief, anger, confusion, perhaps even a bit of relief mixed with the pain.  Let's break down what you've shared and talk about how to navigate this.

**First, acknowledging the pain:**

* **You are allowed to grieve.** Even though he was the one who was unfaithful, and even though it ultimately led to this, ending a relationship is *always* a loss. You're grieving the future you imagined, the commitment that was broken, and the person you thought he was.  Don't minimize your feelings.
* **It's valid to feel confused.**  You kept forgiving him, and that's a testament to your love and hope.  It's confusing when someone you love repeatedly breaks your trust, and it's even *more* confusing when the outcome is him leaving, making it feel like *you* did something wrong.  You didn't.
* **His leaving doesn't negate the hurt he caused.**  His getting ""tired"" of the situation doesn't excuse his actions. It's a statement about *his* inability to deal with the consequences of *his* choices, not a reflection of your worth.

**Let's unpack what you said about forgiving and questioning:**

This is a really important part. You repeatedly forgave him, but it came at a cost.  That constant questioning, that needing to check up on him, that lack of trust... that was exhausting for *you*.  That's not a healthy way to live, even if it felt like you were trying to protect yourself. 

* **Forgiveness doesn't require staying.** You can forgive someone for your own peace of mind, but that doesn't mean you have to continue to subject yourself to their behavior.  Forgiveness is for *you*, not for them.
* **The questioning was a symptom, not a cause.**  His actions *caused* you to question him. It wasn't your fault you were trying to protect yourself from further pain. It's a natural response to repeated betrayal.  You were trying to manage an unmanageable situation.
* **He created this dynamic.** He broke the trust. He created the environment where you felt you *needed* to question him. He's responsible for that.



**What now? (Some ideas for moving forward):**

* **No Contact:** This is *crucial*.  I know it's hard, but you need space to heal.  That means no calls, no texts, no social media stalking.  Block him if you need to.  Every interaction will pull you back and prevent you from moving on.  This includes ""checking in"" to see how *he's* doing.
* **Lean on Your Support System:** Talk to friends, family, a therapist – anyone you trust.  Don't isolate yourself.  Let people care for you.  Let them remind you of your worth.
* **Therapy:**  Seriously consider therapy.  A therapist can help you process your emotions, understand the patterns that led you to stay in this situation, and develop healthy boundaries for future relationships.  They can also help you rebuild your self-esteem.  Look for someone specializing in relationship trauma or infidelity.
* **Self-Care:**  This isn't just bubble baths (though those are nice too!). It's about actively doing things that nourish your mind, body, and soul.  Exercise, eat healthy, spend time in nature, pursue hobbies, read, meditate – whatever brings you joy and helps you reconnect with yourself.
* **Focus on Rebuilding Yourself:** This is a time to rediscover who *you* are, independent of him. What are your passions? What are your goals? What makes you happy? Invest in yourself.
* **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be incredibly therapeutic.
* **Be Kind to Yourself:**  There will be good days and bad days.  Don't beat yourself up for feeling sad or angry.  Allow yourself to feel what you need to feel, and remember that healing takes time.

**Addressing the feeling of responsibility:**

You mentioned he ""got tired"" and left, and that might make you feel like you drove him away with your questioning.  That's not true.  He left because he was unwilling to change his behavior and accept the consequences of his actions. He chose to end the relationship rather than address the root cause of the problems *he* created.

"My girlfriend and I have broken up and gotten back together numerous times in the past two years. We recently just broke up again last night on New Year’s Eve. When we break up, the very next day, she calls me and acts as if nothing has happened. She acts like everything is alright. This has been going on for two years. I do love her and care about her and her children a lot, but she seems really demanding as far as what she deserves from a man. She is always telling me that she deserves this and that from a man. It makes me feel like crap because I cannot give her everything that she wants. She told me one time that she wants a man who is going to be afraid to lose her. Is that a normal thing that women want, or should I just move on already? I am in my 30s and she is in her 40s.","Love is not enough to keep a relationship together.The people need to get along happily too.Let's start with knowing more about your happiness in being with your partner.The frequent break ups happen for a reason.  Try understanding more of why you go back together again.You state a few very clear reasons to not continue this relationship, such as ""feeling like crap"" and not liking that your girlfriend hopes her  partner will feel afraid to leave her.Trust your intuition telling you that these feelings matter.Sometimes men aren't sure whether following their instinct is a right action to take.It is.Also, hoping a partner will fear losing them, shows a wish to control a person.Control has nothing to do with love and trust, and these are basics of a relationship.Good luck!","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and you're right to question it. You're caught in a cycle, and it's exhausting and damaging to your self-worth. Let's break down what's happening and then address your question about whether her desires are ""normal"" and what *you* should do.

**Understanding the Cycle**

What you're describing is a classic push-pull dynamic. She breaks up with you (the push), then immediately reverts to normalcy (the pull). This is incredibly confusing and emotionally manipulative, even if she doesn't intend it to be. Here's what's likely going on *from her side* (though remember, you can't know her motivations for sure - this is educated guessing based on the pattern):

* **Testing:** She might be testing your investment and how much you'll chase. The quick ""everything is fine"" call could be to see if you'll immediately try to win her back.
* **Control:**  The cycle gives her a sense of control. She initiates the break, then dictates the terms of re-engagement.
* **Avoidance of Vulnerability:** Truly confronting the issues in the relationship and working through them is *hard*. Breaking up and then quickly smoothing things over avoids the discomfort of genuine vulnerability.
* **Fear of Being Alone:** This is a possibility. Breaking up and then reaching out quickly can be a way to alleviate loneliness.
* **Unrealistic Expectations:** Her focus on what she ""deserves"" suggests a rigid idea of what a relationship *should* look like, and potentially an unwillingness to compromise.

**The ""Afraid to Lose Me"" Statement**

You asked if wanting a man who is afraid to lose her is normal. It's...complicated. Here's a nuanced answer:

* **Wanting to feel desired and valued is *absolutely* normal.** Every person wants to feel like their partner cherishes them and would be upset if they were gone.
* **Wanting a partner to be *afraid* is a red flag.**  That phrasing implies a need for control, and it's rooted in insecurity. A healthy relationship isn't about fear; it's about *choice*.  A partner should *want* to be with you, not feel trapped or fearful of losing you.  It's the difference between ""I want you to stay because I love and appreciate you"" versus ""You better stay, or I'll be devastated.""  The latter creates an unhealthy dynamic.

**Why This Is Especially Problematic**

* **It's exhausting for you:** Constantly trying to meet demands you can't or don't want to meet will deplete your emotional energy.
* **It erodes your self-respect:**  Being put in a position where you feel inadequate because you don't fit her ideal is damaging.
* **It prevents genuine connection:** The cycle prevents you from having a truly honest and equal partnership.
* **The age difference *can* play a role:**  While not definitive, the age difference could contribute to different life stages and expectations.  She may have a clearer idea of what she wants, or be less willing to compromise.
* **Her children:** You mention caring for her children. Be careful not to fall into the role of a parental figure if that’s not what you signed up for. Your relationship with her is separate from her parental responsibilities.



**Should You Move On?**

This is the hardest question, and the answer is...probably, yes.  Here's a breakdown of why, and what to consider:

1. **The Pattern:** Two years of this is a *long* time. Patterns rarely change without both people actively working on them with the help of a therapist.  She hasn’t shown any indication of recognizing the pattern or wanting to change it.
2. **Your Feelings:** You say she makes you feel ""crap."" That’s a HUGE indicator. You deserve to be with someone who makes you feel good about yourself, not someone who consistently diminishes your worth.
3. **Her Demands:** Her focus on what she ""deserves"" is a warning sign. It suggests a lack of reciprocity and a potential for continued dissatisfaction.
4. **The New Year's Eve Breakup:**  Breaking up on a significant occasion like New Year's Eve is often a sign of emotional immaturity. The immediate follow-up call reinforces the cycle.

**What to do *Now*:**

* **No Contact (This is Crucial):**  This is the hardest part, but it's essential.  Do *not* respond to her calls, texts, or attempts to re-engage.  Block her number if necessary. You need space to heal and gain clarity.  The ""everything is fine"" call is designed to pull you back in. Don'",0.5304917693138123,2.684766723895875e-155,0.09223847019122611,0.23500810372771477
"My coworkers are making false statements about me to the boss, saying I have mood swings. They have no proof to back it up. Can my employer make me see a therapist of their choice?","If this is a concern of a few coworkers, make sure it is not something they see but you don't admit to.  Employers can ""suggest"" or something ""stipulate"" in continued employment with them  for you to go to their Employment Assistance Provider (EAP) if they have noticed the same behavior and concerned of how it is effecting productivity or employee relationships.  No one wants to work in a environment which they consider hostile.  Employers can be held responsible if they do not take action.Couple of things you can do...Ask a coworker in which you trust and respect if what others are saying is true?Seek professional help from your primary care provider or counselor if mood swings do exist.      ","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and you're right to be concerned about your rights. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, what your employer can and can't do, and what steps you should take, covering the legal aspects as well as practical advice.  I'll also include a disclaimer at the end, as I'm not a lawyer.

**1. Understanding the Situation: Defamation & Potential Discrimination**

* **Defamation (Libel/Slander):** What your coworkers are doing *could* be defamation.  Specifically, it's likely *slander* (spoken defamation). To prove defamation, you generally need to show:
    * **False Statement:** The statements are factually untrue.  ""Mood swings"" without specific examples or evidence is a gray area, but if they are presenting it as an established fact when it's not, that's a problem.
    * **Publication:** The statement was communicated to a third party (your boss).
    * **Harm:** The statement harmed your reputation. This is where it gets tricky.  If it's affecting your work, opportunities, or how you're treated, that's harm.
    * **Fault:**  The level of fault required depends on whether you are a public figure.  Generally, for a private employee, you need to show negligence on the part of your coworkers – they didn't take reasonable care to determine if the statement was true.  Sometimes, if the statement is made with malice (knowing it's false or with reckless disregard for the truth), the standard is higher.
* **Potential Discrimination:** If the accusations of ""mood swings"" are being used to justify adverse employment actions (demotion, termination, denial of promotion, etc.), and those accusations are related to a protected characteristic (like a mental health condition, even if you haven't disclosed one), it *could* be discrimination.  Even *perception* of a mental health condition can be protected.
* **The Core Issue:** Your coworkers are creating a potentially damaging narrative, and your employer is receiving it.  The employer has a duty to investigate reasonably and not act on unsubstantiated claims.



**2. Can Your Employer Make You See a Therapist? (The Short Answer: Usually No, But It's Complicated)**

This is the crucial question. Here's a detailed breakdown:

* **Generally, No.**  In most cases, an employer *cannot* force you to undergo a psychological evaluation or therapy.  This is a violation of your privacy and can be seen as discriminatory.  The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) protects employees from being subjected to medical examinations unless they are job-related and consistent with business necessity.
* **Exceptions – When It *Might* Be Permissible (and even then, it's risky for the employer):**
    * **Job-Related & Consistent with Business Necessity:**  The employer has a *very* high bar to clear here. They would need to demonstrate a legitimate, objective reason to believe your behavior is impacting your ability to perform your essential job functions *and* that a psychological evaluation is the *least intrusive* way to address the concern.  Simply stating ""mood swings"" is *not* enough.  They need specific, documented examples of problematic behavior that directly affect your work.  (e.g., losing control in client meetings, making significant errors due to inability to focus, etc.).  The evaluation must be directly tied to those specific concerns.
    * **Safety Concerns:** If your behavior poses a *direct threat* to yourself or others, the employer might have more leeway, but even then, it's a delicate situation involving legal and ethical considerations.  This is usually in cases of demonstrable violence or threats.
    * **Voluntary Referral:**  The employer can *offer* an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) or suggest counseling, but it must be *voluntary* on your part.  They cannot pressure or coerce you into attending.
    * **Last Chance Agreement:**  In rare cases, if there *are* documented performance issues and you've been given warnings, an employer might offer a ""last chance agreement"" where agreeing to counseling is a condition of continued employment.  This agreement needs to be carefully reviewed by an attorney.

* **What an Employer *Cannot* Do:**
    * **Mandatory, Unrelated Evaluations:**  They can't demand you see a therapist simply because of rumors or unsubstantiated claims.
    * **Punish You for Refusing:** They can't retaliate against you (demote, fire, etc.) for refusing a mandatory evaluation that isn't legally justified.
    * **Base Decisions Solely on Speculation:** They can't make employment decisions based solely on the opinions of your coworkers without a proper investigation.




**3. What You Should Do –",0.5263033509254456,4.6644728539134206e-79,0.10071942446043165,0.28042490778991336
"My ex-boyfriend and I have been back and forth for over a year now. He's in his late 20s, divorced for like five years now with two kids. He has a lot of narcissistic behaviors. He lies and cheats, but I love him. I've tried to date other people, but I always go back to him.","There are a lot of pieces to the decision of whether to stay or leave. Can you have open conversations about your concerns? Is he able to listen to that? I'm not sure how you know for sure that he lies and cheats, but does he recognize these things as problems? Which part of you is bigger: the part of you that wants to stay or the part of you that wants to leave? Can you consider what you want, wish for, and desire while also considering the same for him? Can he do that for you?","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and you're being very honest about it, which is a good first step. It's clear you're caught in a painful cycle, and acknowledging the problematic behaviors *and* your own feelings is important. Let's break down what's happening and explore some ways to think about this.  I'm going to give a fairly lengthy response because this is complex, and I want to cover a lot of ground.  **Please read the disclaimer at the very end – I am not a therapist, and this is not therapy.**

**Understanding the Dynamic**

* **The Pull of Familiarity:** Even a *painful* familiar pattern can be incredibly strong. It's comfortable, in a twisted way. You know his buttons, he knows yours.  There's a predictability, even if it's negative predictability, that can feel safer than the uncertainty of something new.
* **Trauma Bonding:**  This is very common in relationships with narcissistic individuals. The cycle of idealization (love bombing, making you feel amazing), devaluation (criticism, put-downs, lies), and discard (or threats of discard) creates a strong emotional bond that's *addictive*.  The intermittent reinforcement – the occasional good times mixed with the bad – keeps you hooked, hoping for the ""good"" him to return.  This isn't love, it's a chemical reaction in your brain.
* **The ""Fixer"" Tendency:** You mentioned you love him. Often, people who are drawn to partners with narcissistic traits have a strong desire to ""fix"" them, to see the good they believe is hidden inside. This is exhausting and ultimately futile.  Narcissism is a deeply ingrained personality pattern.
* **Low Self-Esteem (potentially):** This isn't a judgment, but it's something to consider.  People with lower self-esteem can be more vulnerable to narcissistic abuse because they may feel they don't deserve better.  They may also be more likely to accept mistreatment.
* **His Circumstances:**  His divorce and having children add layers. He might present himself as needing you, or use his children as leverage (consciously or unconsciously). This isn’t about *you* rescuing him or his family, though.
* **Lies and Cheating:** These are *serious* breaches of trust.  They are not things to be tolerated or excused. They are indicative of a deep disrespect for you and the relationship.



**Why You Keep Going Back**

You've already identified a key reason: you love him. But let's unpack that ""love."" Is it love for *who he is now*, or love for the *potential* you see in him, or a memory of who he *used* to be?  Often, it's the latter.  

* **Hope:** You’re likely holding onto hope that he will change, that he'll finally see you and treat you the way you deserve.  
* **Fear of Being Alone:**  This is a very common fear.  The thought of being without him, even with all the pain, can feel scarier than staying.
* **Familiarity and Comfort (even negative):** As mentioned before, even a bad situation can be more comfortable than the unknown.
* **Emotional Investment:** You've invested a lot of time and emotion into this relationship.  It's hard to walk away from that.




**What You Can Do – It's About *You***

This is the hardest part, and it requires a lot of courage and self-compassion.

1. **Accept That You Cannot Change Him:** This is the most crucial step.  He has to *want* to change, and even then, it requires extensive therapy and consistent effort.  You are not his therapist, and you cannot fix him.  Focus on what *you* can control: your own actions and boundaries.

2. **No Contact (Seriously):**  This is incredibly difficult, but it's often the only way to break the cycle.  This means:
   * **No texting, calling, emailing.**
   * **No social media stalking.**  Unfollow, block if necessary.
   * **No ""checking in"" on him through mutual friends.**
   * **No responding to attempts to contact you (even if they're manipulative or guilt-tripping).**
   * **This includes “soft contact” like liking posts.**

   No contact isn’t about punishing him; it’s about protecting *yourself*. It gives you the space to heal, to rediscover who you are, and to break the trauma bond.  Expect him to try to hoover (suck you back in) – especially during no contact. Be prepared for this and resist.

3. **Focus on Yourself:**",0.474184513092041,4.0775800625245246e-79,0.09641532756489493,0.26559360190274767
"Whenever I don't tell my friends or anyone what I did or stuff that's not really important, I feel terrible, like there’s a hole in my stomach. It only goes away when I hurt myself.","Hi Kansas, I feel strongly that the help of a professional therapist is important here. Feelings are never wrong, but it can help to understand where they come from and talk to someone who can teach you healthy ways to cope. Self-harm is not the answer to managing those emotions you feel in your stomach. Although I'm glad you said something here, a professional would need to spend some time with you and get a deep understanding of your life in order to help you sort all these reactions out effectively. I hope you reach out to someone soon. ","Okay, this sounds really tough, and I want you to know you're incredibly brave for sharing this. It takes a lot of courage to talk about something like this, and I'm glad you reached out.  What you're describing – feeling a physical discomfort and then finding that self-harm alleviates it – is a really serious sign that you're struggling with a lot.  It's *not* a solution, even though it feels like it in the moment, and it's a pattern that needs to be addressed.  Let's break down what's happening and what you can do.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Emotional Numbing & Avoidance:** The discomfort you feel when you *don't* share things, even small things, suggests you might be experiencing emotional numbing.  You might be used to seeking external validation or feeling defined by what you *do* and what others know about you.  When that's taken away (by keeping things private), it can feel incredibly unsettling.  This can stem from a lot of things, like past experiences where your feelings weren't validated, or a learned pattern of needing to control how others perceive you.
* **The Connection Between Emotional Pain and Physical Pain:**  The ""hole in your stomach"" is a physical manifestation of emotional distress.  Our brains sometimes have trouble processing intense emotions directly, so they can translate them into physical sensations.
* **Self-Harm as Coping Mechanism:**  The fact that self-harm temporarily relieves the discomfort is a key indicator that it's become a coping mechanism.  It's likely providing a release of pent-up emotions, a sense of control, or even a way to *feel* something when you feel numb.  However, it's a very dangerous and damaging coping mechanism. It's important to understand that the relief is temporary, and it doesn't address the underlying issues.  It's a way of dealing with the *symptom* (the emotional pain) rather than the *cause*.
* **Possible Underlying Issues:**  This pattern could be connected to several things, including:
    * **Anxiety:**  Perhaps anxiety about what others think, or a fear of being judged.
    * **Depression:**  Feeling emotionally empty or numb is common in depression.
    * **Attachment Issues:**  Difficulty with intimacy and a need for reassurance can contribute.
    * **Trauma:** Past traumatic experiences can significantly impact emotional regulation and coping mechanisms.
    * **Personality Traits:**  Perfectionism, high sensitivity, or a strong need for approval can also play a role.



**What You Can Do (and *Please* Read This Carefully)**

1. **Safety First:**  **If you are in immediate danger of harming yourself, please reach out for help right now.**  I'm going to list resources at the end of this response.  Don't hesitate to use them.  Your life is valuable, and there are people who want to help you.

2. **Talk to Someone (a Professional):**  This is the *most* important step.  What you're experiencing is complex, and you deserve professional support. A therapist can help you:
    * **Understand the root causes** of your feelings and behaviors.
    * **Develop healthier coping mechanisms** to manage emotional distress.
    * **Process any underlying trauma** that might be contributing.
    * **Challenge negative thought patterns.**
    * **Improve your self-esteem and self-worth.**
    * **Learn emotional regulation skills.**

3. **Start Small with Sharing:**  Instead of feeling like you have to share *everything*, start with small, low-risk disclosures.  Tell a trusted friend or family member something small about your day.  Practice sharing your *feelings* (e.g., ""I felt a little frustrated when..."") rather than just facts.  This can help you build trust and reduce the anxiety around sharing.

4. **Journaling:**  If you're not ready to talk to someone, journaling can be a safe outlet for your emotions.  Write down what you're feeling, even if it doesn't make sense.  Don't censor yourself.

5. **Mindfulness and Grounding Techniques:**  When you start to feel that ""hole in your stomach,"" try some mindfulness or grounding exercises. These can help you stay present in the moment and reduce anxiety.  Examples include:
    * **Deep breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system.
    * **5-4-3-2-1 technique:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Progressive muscle relaxation:**  Tense and",0.5172919034957886,6.871104085125214e-79,0.09181141439205955,0.29449097938144336
"My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board—no more drinking every night.
 The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.  I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. I just feel like I'm so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty. He is a good husband in every other regard.","As exasperated as you feel, and as obvious it is to you that your husband cares more about drinking than being honest with you, changing this is up to him.Does he care that you're upset with him for drinking more than he can handle?Does he care about you more than drinking?Living with an alcoholic, which is how his behavior sounds, is lonely and frustrating.Concentrate on what you like about him as he is now with his drinking.Your happiness matters.  His ignoring of what you're talking about, doesn't mean your requests are unreasonable.Be prepared to learn to live with and accept how he behaves, or not.Avoid the expectation that you can convince him to change.People change only when they realize their life can improve by changing.  He doesn't sound like this, at least now.","You are absolutely *not* overreacting. Your feelings are completely valid and understandable. This isn't about the alcohol itself, as much as it is about the dishonesty and the broken trust. You're right to feel hurt and frustrated. Here's a breakdown of why, and what you can consider doing:

**Why You're Right to Feel This Way:**

* **Repeated Pattern of Deception:** This isn't a one-time slip-up. This is a pattern. He agreed to limit drinking, then drank secretly, lied about it, and you *caught* him. It's happened before, and now it's happening again. The pattern is what's so damaging.
* **Erosion of Trust:** You’ve explicitly stated you value honesty, and he's repeatedly violating that. Trust is the foundation of any strong relationship, and his behavior is chipping away at it.  The fact that you feel the need to *count* beers is a clear sign the trust is gone.
* **The Snapping & Denial:** His quick, angry denial, and the slurring, are classic indicators he *was* drinking. The snapping isn’t a sign of innocence; it's a sign of defensiveness and guilt.
* **Impact on You:** His drinking directly impacts your quality of life. You’re unable to sleep peacefully because of his snoring when he's intoxicated. That's a legitimate concern.
* **Underlying Issue (Potential Addiction):** While he may not label it as addiction, his behavior strongly suggests a problem.  The secrecy, the denial, the continued drinking despite agreements – these are hallmarks of struggling with substance use.



**What You Can Consider Doing:**

1. **Choose a Calm Time to Talk (Not in the Moment):**  Confronting him while he's already intoxicated, or immediately after, rarely goes well.  Wait until he’s sober and you both have time for a serious conversation.
2. **""I"" Statements:** Focus on how *his* actions make *you* feel, rather than accusing him. For example:
   *  Instead of: ""You lied to me again!""
   *  Try: ""I feel hurt and betrayed when I discover you’ve been drinking and then denied it. It makes it hard for me to trust you.""
   *  Instead of: ""You're drinking too much!""
   *  Try: ""I'm worried about your drinking, and I'm concerned about how it impacts our relationship and my sleep.""
3. **Be Specific:**  Refer to the evidence (the missing beers, the vodka, the slurring).  ""I noticed several beers were missing from the fridge, and then I found a shot glass. When I asked if you had been drinking, you slurred your speech.""
4. **Express Your Needs:** Clearly state what you need from him.  ""I need to be able to trust you. I need you to be honest with me, even when it's difficult. I need a partner who keeps their word.""
5. **Set Boundaries:**  This is crucial.  Decide what you are and are not willing to tolerate. This might include:
   *  ""If you continue to drink and lie about it, I will need to re-evaluate our relationship."" (This is a tough one, but important to consider.)
   *  “I will not continue to police the beer fridge. I need you to take responsibility for your choices.”
6. **Suggest Professional Help (Gently but Firmly):** This is the hardest part.  Say something like, ""I'm worried that this might be more than just a casual drinking habit.  Would you be open to talking to a therapist or counselor with me, or on your own, to explore this?""  **Do not diagnose him.** Just express your concern and suggest help.
7. **Consider Al-Anon:**  Even if he refuses to get help, *you* can benefit from support. Al-Anon is a support group for families and friends of alcoholics. It can provide you with coping strategies, validation, and a safe space to share your experiences. (https://al-anon.org/)
8. **Be Prepared for Resistance:** He may get defensive, angry, or minimize his behavior. Try to remain calm and reiterate your needs and boundaries.



**Important Considerations:**

* **You Are Not Responsible for His Behavior:** You cannot *make* him stop drinking.  You can only control your own actions and responses.
* **This is Not Your Fault:**  His dishonesty and potential addiction are *his* issues, not something you caused.
* **Protect Yourself:**  Prioritize your own well-being.



It's incredibly difficult to deal with a loved one who is struggling with alcohol, especially when they are in denial",0.5135895013809204,3.0450054283332047e-155,0.10867052023121389,0.28446001136444354
I have this weird fetish that I'm afraid to open up about it. What should I do?,"This is difficult to answer because you don’t tell us what the fetish is.  I do understand that this is something that is bothering you though. The first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not.  If this is illegal to engage in, then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urges.However, if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd, a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings.  You may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of.  You may find other people have the same interest as you.  Find a therapist that you can trust and tell them.  Don’t hold back with your therapist.  Trust me, they have heard and seen it all by now, and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress, or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are.  There is no need to suffer with this alone. ","Okay, this is a really brave step, even just *asking* about it. It's completely understandable to feel afraid to open up about a fetish, especially if you're unsure how others will react. It takes courage to confront these things within yourself, and even more to consider sharing them. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering self-exploration, safety, and potential avenues for sharing, along with a lot of emphasis on self-compassion.  I'll break it down into sections.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is a complex topic and I'm an AI, not a therapist.**

**1. Self-Reflection & Understanding (The Most Important First Step)**

*   **What specifically feels ""weird"" about it?**  Is it the content itself?  Is it a fear of judgment? Is it because it feels unusual or different from what you perceive as ""normal""?  Pinpointing *why* you're afraid is crucial.
*   **What is the fetish?**  (You don't have to tell *me* specifically, but you need to be clear with yourself).  Understanding the exact nature of the attraction helps you understand its roots and potential impact.
*   **How does it affect you?** Is it causing you distress? Is it interfering with your life, relationships, or ability to function?  Or is it a relatively harmless, private interest?  The level of impact is very important.
*   **Explore the origins (gently).** This isn't about blame, but understanding.  Were there any experiences, thoughts, or influences in your life that might have contributed to this attraction?  This could be anything from early experiences, media consumption, or even just the way your brain is wired.  *Don't get stuck in self-analysis here; just gentle curiosity.*
*   **Is it causing harm to yourself or others?**  This is the most critical question.  If the fetish involves anything non-consensual, illegal, or harmful (to yourself or anyone else), seeking professional help is *essential* (see section 4).  Even if it's not directly harmful, if it leads to risky behavior, that's a red flag.
* **Distinguish between Fantasies and Desires:** It's okay to *have* fantasies. Fantasies are common and don't necessarily mean you want to act on them. Understanding whether this is a passive fantasy or an active desire is important.



**2. Normalizing & Education**

*   **Human Sexuality is Diverse:**  The range of human sexual interests is *vast*. What one person finds unusual, another may not.  Many fetishes are more common than people realize.  The stigma around sexuality makes it hard to talk about these things.
*   **Research:**  (Be careful with this – see safety notes below).  If you're comfortable, you can research the fetish (using discreet search terms).  Understanding that others share similar interests can be validating.  Look for information from reputable sources (see below).
*   **Recognize the Spectrum:**  Attraction isn't always straightforward.  There's a difference between a mild interest and a strong compulsion. Understanding where your interest falls on that spectrum is helpful.

**3.  Considering Sharing (and Who to Share With - if at all)**

This is the hardest part, and you are *not* obligated to share with anyone.  It's okay to keep this private if that feels safest for you.  If you *do* decide to share, choose very carefully.

*   **Start Small:** If you want to test the waters, consider confiding in someone you deeply trust and who has demonstrated open-mindedness and non-judgmental behavior.
*   **Potential Safe People:**
    *   **A Therapist (Highly Recommended - see section 4):**  A therapist is the *safest* and most professional option. They are bound by confidentiality and trained to help you explore your feelings without judgment.
    *   **A Long-Term, Understanding Partner:**  If you have a partner you trust implicitly, and you believe they will be accepting, you might consider sharing.  But be prepared for a range of reactions, and don't feel pressured.
    *   **A Close Friend (with caution):**  Only share with a friend who is known for being open-minded, non-judgmental, and trustworthy.
*   **People to *Avoid* Sharing With (Initially):**
    *   Family members (unless you are absolutely certain they will be accepting).
    *   Casual acquaintances.
    *   People who are known to be judgmental or gossipy.
    *   Anyone you suspect might react negatively or try to control you.
* **Prepare for Reactions:**  Even with a",0.5354970693588257,7.789385052938354e-79,0.13439635535307518,0.3296329209963408
I'm 15 and my girlfriend is 14. Am I a pedophile because I'm attracted to her and she's under 18?,"No. You are not a pedophile. You are both under the appropriate age where it would be seen so. Your both only a year a part so this shouldn't a worry to you. Like Frank said below, Pedophelia is a problem that won't apply to this situation.","Okay, this is a really important question, and it's good you're asking it. It shows you're thinking about whether your feelings are appropriate, and that's a positive step.  Let's break this down very carefully.

**You are almost certainly *not* a pedophile.**

Here's why, and why your worry is understandable, but likely misplaced.  The key is understanding what pedophilia *is*, and it's much more specific than simply being attracted to someone under 18.

* **Pedophilia is a paraphilia:** It's a *specific* and *persistent* sexual attraction to *children* who are *prepubescent* (before puberty). This means generally before the age of 10-12.  It's a clinical diagnosis made by professionals.  Attraction to someone who is going through or has gone through puberty is very different.
* **Age of Consent:** Laws recognize that as people mature, their capacity to consent to a relationship changes.  This is why there are ages of consent, which vary by location.  The age of consent is the age at which someone is legally considered capable of consenting to sexual activity.  (I will discuss the legal implications further down.)
* **Normal Adolescent Attraction:** It's *very common* for teenagers to develop romantic and sexual feelings for people close to their own age, even if there's a slight age difference like one year.  This is a normal part of adolescent development.  Experiencing attraction itself doesn't mean anything is wrong.
* **Power Dynamics:** The concern with age differences, especially when one person is significantly older, is about *power dynamics* and the ability to truly consent.  A 15-year-old and a 14-year-old are both still developing emotionally and are potentially vulnerable to coercion, even if it's unintentional.  This is why relationships with large age gaps are often problematic, even if legal.

**However, your feelings *do* raise some important flags that need to be considered, and your concern is valid. Here's why, and what you need to think about:**

* **The Age Gap:** While one year might not seem like a lot, it *can* be significant at these ages.  A 15-year-old is generally more mature emotionally and socially than a 14-year-old.
* **Legality:**  Regardless of your feelings, *sexual activity* with someone under the age of consent is illegal.  The age of consent varies by state/country.  Even if you don't *have* sexual relations, a significant age difference can raise legal concerns depending on the specific laws in your area. You need to be aware of the laws where you live.
* **Potential for Harm:** Even if not illegal, a relationship with a significant age or maturity difference can be harmful.  It can create an imbalance of power, and potentially lead to emotional manipulation or unhealthy dynamics.
* **Exploring Your Feelings:** It's important to understand *why* you are attracted to someone younger. Are you seeking a sense of control? Are you feeling pressure from peers?  Are you simply experiencing normal adolescent attraction?



**What you should do now:**

1. **Talk to a Trusted Adult:** This is the most important step. Talk to a parent, a school counselor, a trusted teacher, a relative, or another adult you trust.  Explain your feelings and your concerns.  They can offer guidance and support.  Don't be afraid to be honest.  They are there to help, not to judge.
2. **Focus on Emotional Maturity:**  Instead of focusing on age, think about emotional maturity. Are you and your girlfriend on a similar level emotionally? Can you both communicate openly and honestly?  Are you both comfortable setting boundaries?
3. **Respect Boundaries:**  Respect her boundaries, and be aware of your own.  Don't pressure her into anything she's not comfortable with.
4. **Educate Yourself:** Learn more about healthy relationships, consent, and age of consent laws in your area.
5. **Consider Taking a Break:**  It might be helpful to take a step back from the relationship to give both of you space to mature and develop individually.
6. **If you are struggling with intrusive thoughts or urges:**  If you are experiencing unwanted or disturbing thoughts, or if you feel compelled to act on them, please reach out for professional help immediately (see resources below).

"I have been feeling more and more down for over a month. I have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks, but they are almost never triggered by something that I know of.","Answers about our inner lives are most successfully reached from a sense of feeling grounded in oneself.First step is to accept your nervousness and restless sleep.  As often as possible, sleep during daytimes in order for your body to catch up on its need for rest.Accept too about feeling down.  It is normal to feel down once in a while.  From this place of self-acceptance, trust any answers which come up to your mind.  Often answers about complicated topics come in small pieces, not all at once as a whole unit.Also, your description about panic attacks is also completely normal.   They often arise unrelated to particular conditions at a given moment.  They are a healthy symptom your body is trying to expel bad feelings and does this by having the anxiety erupt at times.So, self-acceptance, tolerance of being on a process of clearing out worn out emotional clutter, and sleep at odd times if possible, are all ways to stabilize yourself, which will also feel calm and good!","Okay, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time. Feeling down for over a month, coupled with panic attacks, even without a clear trigger, is definitely something to take seriously. It's good you're recognizing this and reaching out, even if it's just to express it here.  Here's a breakdown of what might be going on, what you can do, and why seeking professional help is important.  I'll try to be thorough, but *please read the disclaimer at the end* as I am not a medical professional.

**Understanding What You're Describing**

* **Persistent Low Mood:**  ""Feeling down for over a month"" suggests you might be experiencing symptoms of depression.  It's more than just a bad day or a temporary slump.  The duration is a key factor.
* **Panic Attacks:** These are sudden episodes of intense fear that cause physical symptoms like a racing heart, shortness of breath, dizziness, trembling, and a feeling of impending doom.  The fact that they're happening *without* obvious triggers is significant.  This can point to a few things:
    * **Generalized Anxiety:** Anxiety that isn't tied to specific situations.
    * **Panic Disorder:** A condition where you experience recurrent, unexpected panic attacks.
    * **Underlying Depression:** Panic attacks are common in people with depression, even when the depression itself doesn't *feel* anxious.
    * **Physiological Factors:**  Sometimes, physical health issues (see below) can manifest as panic attacks.
* **Sleep Disturbance:**  Panic attacks definitely disrupt sleep.  The anticipation of another attack can also create anxiety that makes it hard to fall asleep or stay asleep.  Sleep deprivation then worsens both mood and anxiety, creating a vicious cycle.
* **Spontaneous Panic:**  The lack of clear triggers is concerning. While triggers exist for everyone, the absence of easily identifiable ones suggests the anxiety might be more deeply rooted or related to internal factors.



**What You Can Do *Right Now* (Self-Help - These are good starting points, but *not* replacements for professional help):**

* **Prioritize Sleep Hygiene:**  This is crucial, even though it's hard when anxious.
    * **Regular Schedule:** Go to bed and wake up around the same time every day, even on weekends.
    * **Relaxing Bedtime Routine:**  Warm bath, reading (not on a screen!), gentle stretching, meditation.
    * **Sleep Environment:** Dark, quiet, cool room.
    * **Avoid:** Caffeine, alcohol, and large meals close to bedtime.  Also, limit screen time for at least an hour before bed.
* **Breathing Exercises:**  These can help calm you *during* a panic attack and also as a preventative measure.  Look up ""diaphragmatic breathing"" or ""4-7-8 breathing"" online.  Practice them regularly, even when you're not feeling anxious.
* **Grounding Techniques:** When you feel a panic attack coming on, try to ground yourself in the present moment.  Examples:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Method:**  Name 5 things you can *see*, 4 things you can *touch*, 3 things you can *hear*, 2 things you can *smell*, and 1 thing you can *taste*.
    * **Focus on Physical Sensations:**  Feel your feet on the ground, the texture of your clothes, or the temperature of the air.
* **Gentle Exercise:**  Physical activity can release endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects.  Even a short walk can help.  Don't push yourself too hard.
* **Mindfulness and Meditation:**  These practices can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without getting carried away by them.  There are many apps and guided meditations available (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer).
* **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a helpful way to process them.  Don't worry about grammar or structure; just write whatever comes to mind.
* **Limit Stimulants:** Reduce or eliminate caffeine and alcohol.
* **Healthy Diet:** Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.  Avoid sugary drinks and excessive sugar intake.
* **Social Connection:**  Spend time with people you trust and who make you feel good.  Even a phone call can help.



**Why Professional Help is *Essential***

You've been feeling this way for over a month and are experiencing panic attacks.  This is beyond what self-help alone can usually address.  Here's why you need to see a professional:

* **Accurate Diagnosis:** A doctor or therapist can properly diagnose what's going on (depression, anxiety disorder, panic disorder, etc.).  There could be underlying medical conditions contributing",0.5012406706809998,2.4415947611089185e-155,0.08745684695051784,0.24356617647058826
"I am currently suffering from erectile dysfunction and have tried Viagra, Cialis, etc. Nothing seemed to work. My girlfriend of 3 years is very sexually frustrated. I told her that it is okay for her to have sex with other men. Is that really okay?","Hi, First and foremost, I want to acknowledge your efforts to gain (your) ideal erectile function. If the medications are not working and you have taken them as prescribed, I would encourage you to seek the help of a sex therapist as the dysfunction may be due to a psychological and/or relational issue rather than a physical/medical one. As for your question, only you can answer this. Is it OK? Are you OK with her sleeping with others? Have you thought through what this may look like, feel like, become for you and her? Opening up a relationship is a choice only the people in the relationship can answer. Even then, the answer may change at any point by either of you. I encourage you to also determine what the intention is underneath your telling your girlfriend she could sleep with others. Be clear with the intention and then together have continuous conversations about the expectations of opening up (i.e.: are there any kinds of sex that is off limits, areas of the body where touch or intimacy is not allowed, are uses of safer sex required or not, do you want to know the details or not, so forth). An excellent resource would be the book ""Opening Up"" by Tristan Taormino. I wish you the best of luck!Dr. Lily Zehner, MFT-C","Okay, this is a really complex situation, and you're right to question whether what you've done is ""okay."" It's incredibly brave of you to even ask this question. It shows you care about your girlfriend's needs and your relationship, even while navigating a difficult personal struggle. Here's a breakdown of why this is complicated, things to consider, and why professional help is *strongly* recommended.  I'll cover a lot here, so it will be lengthy, but thoroughness is important.

**First, let's acknowledge the core issues:**

* **Your Erectile Dysfunction (ED):** You've sought medical help, which is good. The fact that common treatments haven't worked suggests you may need further investigation.  There are many potential causes for ED, both physical and psychological, and it's vital to explore those.
* **Your Girlfriend's Sexual Frustration:** Three years is a significant relationship.  Unmet sexual needs can build resentment and significantly damage intimacy over time. Her frustration is *completely* understandable.
* **Your Proposal (Open Relationship):** This is a massive shift in the relationship dynamic.  It's not a simple solution, and it's not something to be entered into lightly.



**Is it ""Okay""?  A Nuanced Answer:**

There's no simple yes or no.  Whether it's ""okay"" depends *entirely* on these things:

1.  **Her Genuine, Enthusiastic, and Ongoing Consent:**  This is paramount.  Did she actively *choose* this, or did she feel pressured, or did she agree because she felt she had no other options to save the relationship?  Consent must be freely given, informed (she understands all the implications), and *revocable at any time*.  If there's any doubt about her genuine desire, this is a huge problem.  It's not okay if she agreed to avoid hurting *you* or because she feels trapped.
2.  **Clear Boundaries and Agreements:**  Has *everything* been discussed in detail?  What are the rules?  Safe sex practices?  Disclosure of partners?  Emotional involvement?  What happens if either of you develops feelings for someone else?  Without clearly defined boundaries, this will likely lead to more pain and conflict.
3.  **Your Motivations:** *Why* did you suggest this? Was it truly about wanting her to be fulfilled, or was it driven by your own guilt, shame, or fear of losing her?  If your motivation is primarily to alleviate your own discomfort, it's not a healthy basis for an open relationship.
4. **Both of your emotional capacity:** Are you both emotionally prepared for this kind of relationship? Open relationships require a very high degree of emotional maturity, self-awareness, and communication skills.



**Why This is Potentially Problematic (Even With Consent):**

* **It can mask underlying issues:**  The ED is a symptom.  The core problem is a disruption in intimacy and sexual connection.  Opening the relationship doesn’t *fix* that; it potentially sweeps it under the rug.
* **It can create emotional complications:**  Jealousy, insecurity, and feelings of inadequacy are common, even in well-managed open relationships.  These feelings can be devastating.
* **Power Imbalance:** Even if she's currently agreeing, there's an inherent power imbalance here. You're the one with the ED; you're the one who suggested this. This can unconsciously influence her decision-making and make her feel less able to express her true feelings.
* **It can change the nature of the relationship:** The dynamic shifts from a dyadic (two-person) relationship to something far more complex. It can erode the sense of exclusivity and emotional safety.
* **Risk of STIs:** Even with safe sex practices, the risk of sexually transmitted infections increases.

**What You Should Do Now (Crucially Important):**

1.  **Individual Therapy (For You):**  You *need* to explore your feelings about the ED, your masculinity, your self-worth, and your motivations for suggesting an open relationship. A therapist can help you unpack these issues in a safe and supportive environment.  This is not about ""fixing"" the ED (though that may be a part of it); it's about understanding yourself and your emotional needs.
2.  **Couples Therapy (Essential):**  This is *critical*. A couples therapist can facilitate a safe and honest conversation between you and your girlfriend. They can help you:
    *   Explore her feelings about the situation.
    *   Determine if she truly consents and feels empowered in this arrangement.
    *   Establish clear boundaries and agreements (if you both decide to proceed).
    *   Address the underlying issues in your relationship that contribute to the sexual difficulties.",0.5290816426277161,3.3968641899135147e-155,0.11974789915966387,0.28426769923000167
"I have these dreams of men, and they always seem to try to hurt me. It's gotten so bad that I first wake at 4:30, then 4:45, and finally stay awake by 6:00.

The longest I've went without sleep is three days.","The good news about your dreams is that your fears are right at the surface of your mind so you can study them and release some of the harm from the terrifying experiences you had which created these bad memories in the first place.The bad news is the feelings themselves are sickening.Probably a therapist would be very helpful for guiding you to unfold these uneasy feelings and their source.This type of deep work is easier with emotional support from someone.  A therapist can give you this plus is knowledgeable about dynamics of someone having been emotionally harmed by another.Or, read a lot online and find out which articles resonate with your emotions.Luckily people are willing to express personal stories of recuperating a sense of peace and safety after being violated by someone.","Okay, this sounds incredibly distressing and is significantly impacting your life. It's really brave of you to share this, and it's important that you know you're not alone, and help is available.  Here's a breakdown of what's happening, why it's happening, and what you can do, along with a *very strong* recommendation to seek professional help.  I'll cover a lot, so please read through it all.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Nightmares and Sleep Disturbances:**  Recurring nightmares, especially those with a consistent theme of being threatened or harmed, are a serious sign.  The fact that these specifically involve men is also a significant detail.  They're not just ""bad dreams""; they're likely indicative of underlying distress.
* **Sleep Fragmentation & Insomnia:** The pattern you describe – waking repeatedly during the night and struggling to fall back asleep – is called sleep fragmentation.  This can quickly lead to insomnia.  Your body is essentially stuck in a heightened state of alert.  Your body is responding to something as if it is in danger.
* **Fear of Sleep:**  This is a natural consequence of having terrifying nightmares.  It's called sleep anxiety.  You're associating sleep with the fear of experiencing those dreams again.  This creates a vicious cycle.
* **Physical & Emotional Exhaustion:** Three days without sleep is *extremely* dangerous.  Prolonged sleep deprivation can have severe consequences for your physical and mental health, impacting your mood, cognitive function, immune system, and overall well-being.
* **Possible Underlying Causes:** The nightmares could stem from a variety of sources, potentially including:
    * **Past Trauma:** This is the most important thing to consider.  Have you experienced any past trauma, especially involving men, such as abuse (physical, emotional, sexual), harassment, or threatening experiences? Even if the memory feels distant or repressed, it can manifest in nightmares.
    * **Anxiety & Stress:**  High levels of anxiety, even if not directly related to a specific trauma, can trigger nightmares.  Stressful life events, ongoing worries, and general anxiety disorders can all contribute.
    * **PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder):** If the nightmares are related to a traumatic event, you may be experiencing symptoms of PTSD.
    * **Depression:** Depression and sleep disturbances often go hand-in-hand, and nightmares can be a symptom of depression.
    * **Medical Conditions:**  While less likely, certain medical conditions or medications can sometimes contribute to nightmares.



**What You Can Do *Right Now* (Immediate Steps)**

1. **Prioritize Safety:**  If you feel unsafe in your home, even if it's just a feeling connected to the dreams, explore options for increasing your sense of security.  This might include locking doors and windows, having a friend or family member stay with you, or temporarily staying elsewhere.
2. **Emergency Sleep Support (Short-Term - not a solution, but for tonight):**
   * **Warm Milk/Herbal Tea:** A warm, caffeine-free drink can be mildly relaxing. (Chamomile, lavender)
   * **Relaxation Techniques:**  Try deep breathing exercises (box breathing is good: inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4), progressive muscle relaxation (tensing and relaxing different muscle groups), or guided meditation specifically for sleep.  There are many free apps and videos available (Calm, Headspace, YouTube).
   * **Avoid Screens:**  Turn off all screens (phone, TV, computer) at least an hour before bed.  The blue light emitted from screens interferes with melatonin production.
   * **Quiet Environment:**  Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.
3. **Journaling:** Keep a dream journal. Write down as much as you can remember about the nightmares as soon as you wake up.  This can help you identify patterns and potential triggers.  Even just writing down your feelings of fear and anxiety can be helpful.
4. **Self-Care During Waking Hours:**  Engage in activities that help you relax and de-stress during the day. This could include exercise, spending time in nature, listening to music, or pursuing hobbies.



**Crucially:  Professional Help - This is essential.**

* **Therapist/Counselor:**  This is the *most important* step.  A therapist specializing in trauma (look for EMDR, Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), or Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)) can help you process the underlying causes of the nightmares.  They can provide a safe space to explore your experiences and develop coping mechanisms. *Specifically* tell the therapist about the male figures in your dreams and the fear they evoke.

What makes a healthy marriage last?,It's surprising how many folks talk too much on the subject;It's the same three things that make all relationships work:HonestyTrustRespect(in that order)Most folks fall down on the first :) (*coughcough* THERAPISTS!  Heh heh heh...),"Okay, this is a big question! There's no single magic formula, but a *lot* of research and observation has gone into understanding what makes marriages thrive. Here's a breakdown, categorized for clarity, of the key ingredients for a lasting, healthy marriage.  I'll try to be thorough.  It's a long answer, because it's a complex topic!

**I. Foundational Elements (The Bedrock)**

These are the things that need to be present from the start, or developed early on.

*   **Mutual Respect:** This is HUGE.  It means valuing your partner's opinions, feelings, needs, and perspectives *even when you disagree*. It involves politeness, consideration, and avoiding belittling or contempt.  Contempt (mocking, sarcasm, eye-rolling) is a marriage killer.
*   **Trust:**  Believing in your partner's honesty, integrity, and loyalty.  Trust is earned over time through consistent actions and broken by betrayals (which can be big or small).  It's also about feeling safe enough to be vulnerable with your partner.
*   **Shared Values:**  While you don't need to agree on *everything*, having core values aligned (about things like family, finances, religion, life goals, parenting) makes navigating life together much smoother. Significant value clashes can create constant friction.
*   **Compatibility:** This isn’t about having identical interests, but a general alignment in lifestyle, temperament, and social needs.  Are you both introverts who enjoy quiet nights in, or extroverts who thrive on social events?  Major mismatches can be challenging.
*   **Commitment:** A conscious decision to prioritize the marriage and work through challenges, even when it's difficult.  This is more than just ""not wanting to get divorced""; it's an active, ongoing choice.  It's believing in ""us"" over just ""me.""
*   **Love & Affection:** This seems obvious, but it's more than just romantic love. It’s showing affection regularly - physically (hugs, kisses, touch) and emotionally (words of affirmation, acts of service).  Love needs to be *expressed*.

**II. Communication & Emotional Connection (The Glue)**

These are the daily practices that keep the connection strong.

*   **Open & Honest Communication:**  Being able to talk about anything – your hopes, fears, dreams, frustrations – without fear of judgment. This includes both positive and negative feelings.
*   **Active Listening:**  Truly *hearing* your partner, not just waiting for your turn to speak.  This means making eye contact, nodding, asking clarifying questions, and summarizing what you've heard to ensure understanding.
*   **Vulnerability:**  Sharing your authentic self with your partner – your imperfections, insecurities, and vulnerabilities.  This builds intimacy and trust.
*   **Empathy:**  Trying to understand your partner's perspective, even if you don't agree with it.  Putting yourself in their shoes.  (""I can see why you'd feel that way..."")
*   **Regular Check-Ins:**  Making time for dedicated conversations about the relationship – how things are going, what needs aren't being met, what's working well.  This could be a weekly ""date night"" focused on connection, or even just 30 minutes of uninterrupted conversation.
*   **Conflict Resolution Skills:**  Every couple argues. The key is *how* you argue. Healthy conflict resolution involves:
    *   **Fighting Fair:** No name-calling, blaming, or bringing up the past.
    *   **Focusing on the Issue:**  Addressing the specific problem, not attacking your partner's character.
    *   **Compromise:**  Being willing to meet your partner halfway.  Not every battle needs to be won.
    *   **Taking Breaks:**  If things get too heated, taking a break to cool down before continuing the conversation.
    * **Repair Attempts:** Recognizing when you've hurt your partner and trying to make amends (apologizing, offering comfort).
* **Appreciation & Gratitude:** Regularly expressing appreciation for your partner and the things they do.  Small gestures of gratitude can go a long way. (""Thank you for making coffee this morning,"" ""I really appreciate you listening to me."")



**III.  Practical Life Skills (The Maintenance)**

These are the everyday actions that contribute to a stable and harmonious marriage.

*   **Financial Compatibility:**  Having open and honest conversations about money, creating a budget together, and making financial decisions as a team.  Financial stress is a major source of marital conflict.
*   **Shared Responsibilities:**  Dividing household chores, childcare, and other responsibilities fairly (though ""fair"" doesn't always mean 50",0.434459924697876,1.387009026462471e-155,0.0396600566572238,0.0966702470461869
"I'm in a long-distance relationship with my ideal man, but I'm not as attracted to him as I should be. Everything else is perfect about him, but I find myself lusting over more attractive men. The next step is marriage, but I want to marry someone who I can wake up to and fall in love with all over again. However, I also don't want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust. Am I asking for too much in the ""perfect guy""? Is there such a thing? Am I truly in love?","Attraction is important but sometimes over-rated. I'm curious about your comment that you are not as attracted as you ""should be"" - What is your measuring stick is for what you are supposed to feel in terms of attraction in a relationship? Do you want to be sexually intimate? Do you enjoy having sex with him? Are you satisfied with your sexual relationship when you are with him? The fact that there is lust for other more attractive men does not necessarily mean anything. There will always be attractive men and more attractive men than your partner and these attractive men will be even more appealing when you are in a long-distance relationship far from the arms of your partner. Loving someone does not mean that you stop being a sexual being who no longer notices and desires attractive men. Attraction results from a number of factors beyond appearance - including the degree to which you feel emotionally open, safe, and connected and how in tune you are with each other's bodies. It sounds like you think very highly of this man ""everything else is perfect about him"". Maybe it is worth spending some more time together in the same place if that is possible before deciding on marriage or that you are not truly in love. ","Okay, this is a really common and *incredibly* valid struggle. You've identified a core conflict, and acknowledging it is the first step. Let's break this down. It's a lot, so I'll try to be thorough.

**First, let's validate your feelings:** It's okay to experience attraction to other people *even when you're in a committed relationship*. It doesn't automatically mean you don't love your partner.  Our brains are wired to notice attractive people.  The issue isn't the attraction itself, it's what you *do* with that attraction and what it signifies about your current relationship. The fact that you're feeling conflicted *proves* you're invested in doing this right.



**Addressing your questions:**

* **""Am I asking for too much in the 'perfect guy'?""** Yes, and no.  The *idea* of ""perfect"" is a dangerous one. It's a construct built on unrealistic expectations fueled by media, societal pressures, and our own fantasies.  However, wanting to feel deeply physically attracted to your life partner is *not* too much to ask.  Physical intimacy is an important part of most romantic relationships.  You're not being shallow for wanting that. You *are* wise to recognize it's a significant component of long-term compatibility.
* **""Is there such a thing as a perfect guy?""** Absolutely not. There is a *compatible* guy – someone whose values, personality, and lifestyle mesh well with yours, and with whom you can build a fulfilling life.  But perfection is unattainable.  Focus on compatibility and connection, not perfection.
* **""Am I truly in love?""** This is the hardest question.  The fact you're questioning it is important.  Love isn't just a feeling; it's a complex blend of emotions, behaviors, and choices.  You describe everything else as perfect, which suggests a deep connection, care, and compatibility. But the missing piece—strong physical attraction—is a red flag that needs exploration. It's possible to love someone deeply without being *in love* in the way you desire. Love can exist without intense lust, but for *you*, it seems it's impacting your overall sense of connection.


**Let's dive deeper into what might be happening & how to navigate this:**

**1. Identify *What* Kind of Attraction is Missing:**

* **Physical Attraction:** Is it a specific physical feature you find lacking? Is it a lack of chemistry or spark?  Be brutally honest with yourself.  Is it something that could potentially be addressed (e.g., his fitness, style)?  Or is it a fundamental difference in physical preferences?
* **Emotional Attraction:** Sometimes, what we perceive as ""attraction"" is actually emotional connection. Does he make you laugh? Do you feel safe and understood with him? If the emotional side is strong, it can sometimes overshadow a lack of intense physical chemistry *temporarily*, but it rarely sustains a lifetime.
* **Sexual Compatibility:**  This is distinct from physical attraction.  Are your sexual desires and preferences compatible?  Is the intimacy fulfilling for both of you? Long distance makes this harder to assess, obviously.

**2.  The Long Distance Factor:**

* **Idealization:** Long distance can *easily* lead to idealization. You're not seeing the everyday reality of him. You're likely seeing the best version he presents, and filling in the gaps with your own projections.  This can make it harder to assess real-life attraction.
* **Lack of Physical Intimacy:** This is the obvious one.  Physical touch and intimacy are vital for building and maintaining attraction.  Its absence can contribute to waning feelings or a feeling of disconnect.  
* **Fantasy vs. Reality:**  The distance allows for more fantasy. It’s easier to picture him as “perfect” when you aren’t contending with everyday routines and imperfections.  The men you're lusting over are likely present, real, and stimulating your brain in a way your long-distance partner isn’t *right now*.

**3. Explore Your Own Needs & Expectations:**

* **What does ""waking up and falling in love all over again"" look like *specifically*?**  Is it a feeling, a behavior, a certain type of interaction?  Visualizing this can help you determine if your current relationship can potentially get there.
* **What are your non-negotiables in a partner?**  Write them down.  Be honest about what you absolutely need to feel fulfilled and happy.  Rank them in order of importance.
* **Are you holding onto a fantasy of the ""perfect"" partner that prevents you from fully appreciating the good things you have?**



**What to *do* about it:**

* **Hon",0.5618528723716736,6.759392670253833e-79,0.12394957983193278,0.3181083445168712
How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,"This can be a very challenging decision, and it may take time for you to sort through all of your feelings about the relationship and its possible end. Therapy can help you have a space to be completely honest with yourself about your relationship as you grapple with your decision of whether to remain with your boyfriend. Your therapist can ask questions to guide you in uncovering your true feelings about whether this is the right relationship for you, and he or she can support you in whatever decision you come to.","Okay, this is a *big* question, and it's good you're taking the time to thoughtfully consider it. There's no easy answer, and it's going to require some honest self-reflection. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, broken down into sections. I'll cover things to consider, questions to ask yourself, and things to try before making a final decision.  This is long, but comprehensive!

**I. Understanding Why You're Even Asking This Question**

First, let's acknowledge that just *thinking* about ending a relationship is a significant sign.  Don't dismiss it.  What's brought you to this point?  Here are some common reasons people question their relationships:

*   **Loss of Connection:** You feel distant, like you're roommates instead of partners.
*   **Unresolved Conflicts:**  You keep having the same arguments without resolution.
*   **Changing Values/Goals:** You're growing in different directions and want different things out of life.
*   **Lack of Trust:**  Infidelity, lies, or a general feeling of insecurity.
*   **Emotional/Physical Abuse:** This is a *serious* red flag and requires immediate attention (see resources at the end).
*   **Feeling Unfulfilled:** You're not getting your emotional, intellectual, or physical needs met.
*   **Constant Negativity:** The relationship is draining and makes you unhappy more often than happy.
*   **Loss of Attraction:**  Physical or emotional attraction has diminished.
*   **External Factors:** Stress from work, family, or other life events impacting the relationship. (Sometimes these are temporary, sometimes they reveal deeper issues.)



**II.  Self-Reflection: Questions to Ask Yourself**

This is the most important part.  Be brutally honest with yourself.  Write these down if it helps.

*   **Are my basic needs being met?** (Emotional support, respect, physical affection - if you desire it, intellectual stimulation).  Are these needs *reasonable*?
*   **Am I happy *more often than not* in this relationship?**  Don't focus on ""happy all the time"" – life isn't like that. But is the overall trend positive or negative?
*   **Do I feel safe – emotionally and physically – with this person?**  This is non-negotiable.
*   **Do I like the person I am when I'm *with* him?**  Does he bring out the best in you, or the worst?  Do you feel like you can be your authentic self?
*   **Do we share core values?**  (e.g., honesty, family, ambition, spirituality, finances)  Differences in preferences are okay, but fundamentally different values can create long-term problems.
*   **Do we have compatible life goals?** (e.g., marriage, children, career paths, where to live)
*   **Am I staying because of fear?** (Fear of being alone, fear of hurting him, fear of change, financial dependence).  Fear is *not* a good reason to stay.
*   **Am I staying because of hope that things will change?**  Hope is good, but is that hope realistic, and is he actively working towards those changes?
*   **If nothing changes, can I realistically see myself being happy with him in 5, 10, 20 years?**  This is a long-term perspective.
*    **What specifically bothers me about the relationship?** Be detailed.  ""He's just annoying"" isn't helpful. ""He consistently dismisses my feelings when I try to talk about them"" *is* helpful.
*   **What are my contributions to the problems in the relationship?**  Relationships are a two-way street.  Are you willing to own your part?
*    **What would my life look like without him?**  Don't just focus on the sadness of leaving; consider the possibilities and potential for growth.



**III.  Things to Try *Before* Making a Final Decision (If You're On the Fence)**

If you're not 100% sure, try these steps.  Don't skip this part!

*   **Communicate, Communicate, Communicate:**  This is the big one.  Have an honest and open conversation with your boyfriend.  Choose a good time and place where you won't be interrupted.  Use ""I"" statements (""I feel X when you do Y"") instead of blaming (""You always...""). Be specific about your concerns.
*   **Active Listening:**  Really *listen* to his response, without interrupting or getting defensive.  Try to understand his perspective, even if you don't agree with it.",0.4778344929218292,6.72900277066937e-79,0.09827357237715803,0.27203974347169496
"My older brother (in his 60s) started dating a lady with Asperger's. She is hyper-sexual and flirty. She does not understand boundaries. They’ve been dating for a few months, and she's talking marriage. Another sibling and his wife have met her, and they have said she is never invited back. My brother always picks similar ladies. Do we speak honestly and risk losing a relationship?","If you and your brother are open w each other and respect each other’s opinions then there is little risk your relationship with him will end.If there already is strong animosity, mistrust, dislike between both of you then there is more chance he will not seriously consider your advice.For your own peace of mind, say whatever you feel must be said to him.The person you’ll need to live with is yourself so do what you believe is needed for you to feel good about saying what’s necessary.Even if he never follows through with your advice then you’ll still know you tried your best to advise.","Okay, this is a really tough situation. It's a complex mix of concern for your brother, understanding a neurodiversity, and navigating family dynamics. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, balancing honesty with potential consequences, and considering the nuances involved.  I'll try to be thorough, covering a lot of angles.  It's long, but this isn't simple!

**1. Understanding the Core Issues**

* **Asperger's/Autism & Social Cues:** It's *crucial* to understand that Asperger's (now generally understood as Autism Spectrum Disorder - ASD) impacts social understanding.  This *specifically* includes understanding non-verbal cues, social boundaries, and the subtleties of flirtation. Her hyper-sexuality and flirty behavior may not be intentionally manipulative or predatory; it could be a genuine lack of understanding of how these behaviors are perceived and what's considered appropriate.  It doesn't *excuse* the behavior, but it does explain it. *Avoid attributing malice where misunderstanding is more likely.*
* **Your Brother's Pattern:** The fact that he consistently dates women with similar characteristics is a HUGE red flag. This suggests he may be drawn to dynamics that are familiar, potentially driven by his own needs or unresolved issues.  He might be seeking validation, control, or something else. This is arguably the *most* important part of the problem.
* **The Speed to Marriage:**  A rapid escalation to marriage talk is concerning in *any* relationship, but particularly in this one, given the boundary issues and potential for misunderstanding.
* **Family Disapproval:**  Your sibling and his wife's strong reaction (never inviting her back) indicates a significant level of discomfort and concern.  This creates a rift within the family.
* **Your Dilemma:** You're rightfully worried and want to help your brother, but fear damaging your relationship with him if you speak up.



**2.  Before You Speak: Preparation & Considerations**

* **Educate Yourself:**  Spend some time learning more about ASD in adults, *especially* how it can manifest in social interactions and relationships.  Resources like the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) ([https://autisticadvocacy.org/](https://autisticadvocacy.org/)) are excellent.  Understanding will help you approach the situation with empathy and avoid making assumptions.  Avoid relying solely on stereotypes.
* **Focus on Behavior, Not Diagnosis:**  Frame your concerns around *specific behaviors* you've observed, not the diagnosis itself.  For example, instead of saying ""She doesn't understand boundaries because she has Asperger's,"" say ""I've noticed she makes comments that seem very forward, and I'm worried about how that impacts you.""
* **Identify Your Core Concerns:** What are you *most* worried about? Is it his well-being? Financial exploitation? Emotional distress?  The potential for a harmful dynamic?  Having clarity will help you articulate your thoughts.
* **Accept the Possible Outcomes:**  He may get defensive, dismiss your concerns, or even get angry.  You need to be prepared for that and decide if you're willing to risk the strain on your relationship.  You can't control his reaction.
* **Consider *Why* He Chooses These Partners:**  This is the hardest part.  What need is being met for your brother?  Is he a people-pleaser?  Does he have low self-esteem?  Understanding his motivations will inform your approach.



**3.  How to Have the Conversation(s)**

* **Timing and Setting:** Choose a private, calm setting where you have his undivided attention.  Don't ambush him.  Ask if it’s a good time to talk about something important.
* **Start with Empathy and Affection:**  ""I love you, and I want you to be happy. That's why I'm bringing this up.  I've been observing your relationship with [Her Name], and I have some concerns.""
* **Focus on ""I"" Statements:** Express your feelings and observations from your perspective.  ""I've noticed that she seems very flirtatious, and *I worry* that it might be overwhelming for you.""  ""I've heard you mention marriage, and *I'm concerned* things are moving very quickly.""
* **Be Specific:** Avoid vague accusations.  Provide concrete examples of behaviors that worry you.  ""The other day, I heard her say [Specific Comment], and it struck me as inappropriate.""
* **Address the Pattern:** Gently bring up his history of dating similar women.  ""I've noticed over the years that you seem to be drawn to partners who are very outgoing and expressive. I wonder if we could talk about what you're looking for in a",0.46028268337249756,0.008311348927069789,0.09212121212121212,0.20471464019851116
"We’ve been together almost three years. We argue and he ends it by telling me he doesn’t love me. It's hurtful because I am all about resolving the problem, and he dwells on the issue even if I drop what he's done and just swallow my pride and say I am sorry. How can this be resolved? We have kids, and I don't want a broken family because we can't communicate.","You can't fix this by yourself, but I applaud you for trying. One person working hard in a relationship can make things better for a while., but in the long haul you need two people giving some effort. I'm reading between your lines here and I wonder if your need to keep the family together is getting you to apologize when you've done nothing wrong and ignore things you've felt hurt by. I sense that you're doing all the work...that it's not balanced. I have worked with many couples and I've learned never to underestimate what kind of change is possible; anything is possible. But in order for change in a couple to occur, you need two people who are both willing to own their choices and behaviours, and who have empathy. Your boyfriend doesn't appear to have these components; he pushes you away and blames you when he's done something hurtful.Can you be honest with yourself about what's happening? I encourage you to sit down with a trusted friend or therapist and look at what you have here and what your options are. I wish you well.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, but a very common one. It sounds incredibly painful to be in a cycle where you're trying to repair things and he's escalating, especially with children involved. It's good you're recognizing the pattern and wanting to break it. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, focusing on what *you* can do, what you can ask of *him*, and what outside help might look like.  This is a long response, as it's a complex issue.  I'll try to be thorough.

**Understanding the Dynamic (What's Happening Here)**

Before diving into solutions, let's break down what's likely going on:

* **Emotional Flooding:** He seems to get overwhelmed by conflict and, instead of processing, *disengages* by throwing out the ""I don't love you"" line. This is a very destructive pattern. It’s likely a way to shut down the conversation and protect himself from feeling vulnerable, even if he doesn’t truly mean it in that moment.
* **Unresolved Issues:** He dwells on things, suggesting he doesn't feel heard or that his concerns haven't been adequately addressed *in the past*. This builds up resentment.
* **Different Conflict Styles:** You're a resolver; he's a ruminator. You want to move forward; he wants to dissect. These are fundamentally different approaches to conflict, and without understanding and adapting, they’ll clash constantly.
* **Power Imbalance:** While not necessarily intentional, this dynamic can create a power imbalance. His ""I don't love you"" statement is a very powerful one, and the fact that you consistently apologize even when you feel you're not entirely at fault reinforces this.
* **Fear of Vulnerability:** The ""I don't love you"" could be a fear response.  It might stem from a fear of being hurt, a fear of commitment, or a fear of not being good enough.  It’s not necessarily a reflection of his long-term feelings, but a reaction in the heat of the moment.



**What *You* Can Do (Focusing on Your Actions)**

This is about shifting *your* response, not necessarily trying to ""fix"" him immediately.

1. **Stop the Immediate Apology (This is Hard!)**:  This is the hardest but most crucial step.  Stop automatically apologizing when he brings up an issue, *especially* when he escalates with ""I don't love you.""  Apologizing when you’ve genuinely done something wrong is important, but constantly taking responsibility for everything diffuses your own needs and doesn’t allow him to address his.  Instead of saying ""I'm sorry,"" try:
   * **""I hear you're upset. Let's talk about this when we both feel calmer.""**
   * **""I understand you're feeling [his emotion - try to name it: hurt, frustrated, etc.]. I want to understand what's bothering you.""**
   * **""I need a moment to process what you're saying.""**
2. **Recognize the Pattern & Name It (In the Moment, Calmly):**  When he says ""I don't love you,"" don't engage with the *content* of that statement.  Instead, calmly say something like:  ""When you say that, it shuts down the conversation, and it doesn't help us resolve anything. I want to work through this, but that statement isn’t constructive.""  This calls out the *behavior* rather than accepting the emotional blow.
3. **Set Boundaries:** This is huge.  You need to decide what you will and won't accept.  
   * **""I'm not going to continue this conversation when it becomes a personal attack.""** (and then *walk away* – go to another room, take a break).
   * **""I'm willing to discuss this, but I need you to speak to me respectfully.""**
   * **""I need you to understand that saying you don't love me during an argument is deeply hurtful, and it makes it harder for me to want to resolve things.""**
4. **Focus on ""I"" Statements:**  Instead of ""You always…"" or ""You make me feel…,"" use ""I feel [emotion] when [situation] because [your need].""  For example, ""I feel anxious when you raise your voice because I need to feel safe in our conversations.""
5. **Validate *His* Feelings (Even When You Disagree):** Validation doesn't mean agreement. It means acknowledging his emotions are real *to him*.  ""I can see why you'd be frustrated by that."" or ""It sounds like you felt really unheard.""  This can de",0.523015558719635,3.365358157019296e-155,0.12445414847161573,0.29381991619987713
"What makes my step child, an 8 year old boy, choke my daughter, a 6 year old girl? This has been going on for 4 years. The boy tells my daughter not to tell on him. He knows it's wrong; we have did time out, spanking, taking away toys, and sitting on the wall. I am afraid for my daughters safety!","I can see why you are alarmed. That is a scary situation for a parent. Do you know if the child has been evaluated by a mental health professional? Early treatment is often the key. A professional will be able to help the child learn how to control their anger and mend the troublesome actions into more appropriate responses. Have you addressed your concerns with the child's other parent? There could be contributing factors in his life that could be causing these issues (exposure to violence, sexual/physical abuse, drug use, stressful events in his life, etc.). It is important that these factors are identified so that they can either be eliminated and/or reduced. I wouldn't hesitate to have him evaluated (if he hasn't been already) and to ensure that he is getting the help that he needs whether it be medication and/or therapy. Until then, I would make sure that he is always supervised under an adult's care.","Okay, this is a *very* serious situation and you are right to be afraid for your daughter's safety.  Four years of this behavior, despite multiple interventions, indicates this is beyond typical sibling rivalry and is escalating. Here's a breakdown of what might be going on, why your current methods aren't working, and *what you need to do now*, prioritizing your daughter's safety.  I will cover a lot of ground, so this will be a long response, but it's important to be thorough.  **Please read the section at the very end regarding seeking professional help. It is crucial.**

**Understanding the Behavior (Why is he doing this?)**

There are many potential reasons for this behavior. It's unlikely to be just ""being a boy"" or a phase.  Here are some possibilities.  It’s often a combination of factors:

*   **Power and Control:** This is the most likely core issue. He is establishing dominance over your daughter.  The choking, combined with the instruction not to tell, is about controlling her and maintaining that power dynamic.
*   **Emotional Regulation Difficulties:** He may be struggling to manage his anger, frustration, or other emotions.  Choking could be an impulsive outburst when he feels overwhelmed, even if he later recognizes it's wrong.
*   **Lack of Empathy:** He may have difficulty understanding or caring about your daughter's feelings. This doesn't mean he's inherently malicious, but a developmental gap in empathy can contribute.
*   **Attention-Seeking (Even Negative Attention):** While it doesn’t feel like it, sometimes kids will engage in negative behavior to get a reaction from adults.  Even getting in trouble is a form of attention.
*   **Learned Behavior:**  Has he witnessed aggression in his life (at home, on TV, with peers)?  Children learn by observing.
*   **Underlying Issues:** There could be underlying anxiety, depression, or other emotional issues contributing to his behavior.
*   **Family Dynamics:** The overall family environment, including stress levels, parental conflict, and communication patterns, can play a role.  The step-family dynamic itself can be a source of stress for the boy.
*   **Jealousy/Resentment:**  Does he feel like your daughter gets more attention?  Is he adjusting to a new family structure and feeling insecure?



**Why Your Current Methods Are Likely Failing**

*   **Punishment Without Teaching:** Time-outs, spanking (which is generally not recommended, see below), and taking away toys are *punitive* measures. They tell him what he *did* wrong, but they don't teach him *how to do things differently*.  He knows it's wrong, but that knowledge isn't translating into changed behavior.
*   **Spanking is Harmful:**  Spanking is often linked to increased aggression, anxiety, and depression in children. It models violence as a way to solve problems and can damage the parent-child relationship. It doesn't address the underlying issues.
*   **Inconsistency:**  Is the punishment *always* applied *immediately* when the choking happens?  Inconsistency weakens the impact of any disciplinary method.
*   **Lack of Focus on Safety:**  The primary concern is your daughter’s *physical safety*.  The consequences haven’t been strong enough to deter a dangerous behavior.
*    **The ""Don't Tell"" Element:** His explicitly telling her not to tell means he understands the severity of his actions and is attempting to cover them up. This isn't a simple misbehavior; it's a deliberate attempt to control and conceal.

**What You NEED to Do Now – Prioritizing Safety**

1.  **Immediate Safety Measures:**
    *   **Supervision:**  Increased, *dedicated* supervision is critical.  You cannot leave these two children alone together, even for a few minutes, until you have a professional intervention plan in place. This is non-negotiable.  Think of it like you would if he had a highly contagious illness – containment is key.
    *   **Separate Spaces:**  Create physically separate spaces for them as much as possible. Different play areas, different bedrooms, etc.
    *   **Safe Word:**  Teach your daughter a “safe word” she can use immediately when she feels unsafe.  This word signals to you (or another trusted adult) that she needs help *right now*.  Practice this with her so she knows exactly what to do.
    *   **Reassure Your Daughter:**  Tell her repeatedly that she is loved, that she is not to blame, and that you are going to keep her safe.  Validate her feelings. “It’s okay to be scared.  I believe you.”

"I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out. 

How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it.  I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy.  What should I do?","While this might not be the first thing you want to discuss when you meet someone, it is important for you to be yourself.  It's better to weed out 10 people who can't accept you to find that one who can.  ","Okay, this is a really common and valid struggle, and you're smart to be thinking through it. It's a complex situation with a lot of layers – your identity, your happiness, your dating life, and societal expectations. Let's break it down.  I'm going to give a detailed response, covering a lot of ground, and then summarize with some actionable steps.  This is long, but I want to be thorough.

**Understanding the Core Issues**

* **You are Valid:** First and foremost, let's be crystal clear: There is *nothing* wrong with you.  You are a man attracted to women who *also* enjoys expressing your femininity through crossdressing.  That's a perfectly legitimate way to be.  Your happiness and self-expression are important.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
* **Why it's tricky:**  The discomfort some women express likely stems from a few things:
    * **Societal Conditioning:**  We live in a society with very rigid gender roles and expectations. Many people haven't been exposed to, or aren't comfortable with, deviations from those norms.  They may have preconceived notions or anxieties.
    * **Misunderstanding:** They might misinterpret crossdressing as a sign of questioning your sexual orientation (thinking you're secretly gay or trans, even if you aren't).  This fear is often rooted in misinformation.
    * **Fear of Judgement:** They might worry about what *others* will think if they date someone who crossdresses.  This is about their own social anxieties, not necessarily about you.
    * **Insecurity:**  Sometimes, it can unintentionally trigger insecurities about their own femininity, even if they wouldn't consciously admit it.
    * **Not Being a Match:** Sometimes, it simply means they're not the right person for you, and that's okay.  Everyone has preferences and boundaries.
* **The Conflict:** You're experiencing a conflict between wanting to be authentic (expressing your femininity) and wanting to be accepted (in a relationship). This is a really tough spot to be in.



**To Disclose or Not to Disclose? A Nuanced Approach**

There's no single ""right"" answer. Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons of each approach, and when they might be appropriate:

* **Holding Back (Initially):**
    * **Pros:**  Can allow you to get to know someone *as a person* before potentially introducing a topic that might cause an immediate reaction.  It can reduce the risk of instant rejection.
    * **Cons:**  It feels dishonest.  It can build anxiety, as you're constantly worried about being ""found out.""  It delays the inevitable, and if you *do* disclose later, it can feel like a bigger betrayal of trust. It can also lead you to date people you aren't fully comfortable being yourself around.
    * **When it *might* be okay:**  *Very* early stages of dating, while you're just getting to know someone.  But it shouldn't be prolonged. A few dates, maybe.
* **Being Upfront:**
    * **Pros:**  Authenticity.  You're being honest about who you are.  It attracts people who are genuinely open-minded and accepting.  It saves you time and energy by filtering out those who aren't a good fit. Builds trust from the start.
    * **Cons:**  Potential for immediate rejection.  Requires vulnerability and courage.
    * **When it's best:**  *Before* you get emotionally invested.  In your dating profile (a subtle mention is fine – see examples below), or after a couple of conversations where you feel a connection. 

**How to Disclose (If You Choose To)**

This is crucial.  How you present this information makes a huge difference.

* **Timing:**  Don't drop it in the middle of a romantic moment.  Choose a calm, neutral setting where you can have an open conversation.
* **Framing:** This is *everything*.  Focus on *your* experience and *your* happiness.  Avoid language that sounds apologetic or shameful.
* **Example Phrases:**
    *  ""I want to share something about myself that's important to me. I'm a guy who really enjoys exploring and expressing my feminine side through clothing. It's a part of who I am, and it makes me happy.  I'm attracted to women, and I'm looking for someone who can appreciate all aspects of me.""
    *  ""Just so you know, I enjoy crossdressing as a hobby. It's a creative outlet for me, and it doesn't change who I am as a person or my attraction to women.""

"I just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. My family and I really need this job.

A new job *plus* significant travel *plus* the worry about potential anxiety attacks...that's a huge stress cocktail. It's good you're reaching out and trying to figure out how to manage this. Here's a breakdown of things you can do, categorized for clarity.  I'll cover immediate coping, preventative strategies, and resources. **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am not a medical professional.**

**1. Understanding What Might Be Happening (and the ""Anxiety"" Label)**

*   **Normal Stress vs. Anxiety:** It's *normal* to feel stressed and worried about a big life change like this.  It's also normal to feel scared about new sensations.  Just because people are saying ""anxiety"" doesn't automatically mean you have a clinical anxiety *disorder*.  It means you're experiencing significant anxious feelings.  The term gets thrown around a lot.
*   **What *is* an Anxiety Attack?**  Often, people refer to ""anxiety attacks"" when they mean a *panic attack*.  They involve sudden, intense fear that can cause physical symptoms like:
    *   Rapid heartbeat
    *   Sweating
    *   Trembling
    *   Shortness of breath
    *   Dizziness
    *   Feeling like you're losing control or going to die (this is a very scary *feeling*, but not a physical danger).
*   **They're Manageable:**  Even if you *do* experience a panic attack, they are not physically dangerous.  They are intensely unpleasant, but they will pass. Knowing this is a crucial first step.  Many people experience them, and learn to manage them.



**2. Immediate Coping Strategies (If You Feel Anxious *Now* or While Traveling)**

These are things to use *in the moment* when you're starting to feel overwhelmed.

*   **Deep Breathing:**  This is the cornerstone of calming down.  Try:
    *   **4-7-8 Breathing:** Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds. Repeat several times.  This activates your parasympathetic nervous system (the ""rest and digest"" system).
    *   **Diaphragmatic Breathing:**  Put one hand on your chest and one on your stomach. Breathe deeply so your stomach rises while your chest stays relatively still.
*   **Grounding Techniques:**  These bring you back to the present moment.
    *   **5-4-3-2-1 Method:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    *   **Focus on Physical Sensations:**  Feel your feet on the ground.  Notice the texture of your clothing.  The temperature of the air.
*   **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** Tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body, starting with your toes and working your way up to your head.
*   **Self-Talk:**  Challenge negative thoughts.  Instead of ""I'm going to have a panic attack,"" try ""I'm feeling anxious right now, but I can handle this. This feeling will pass.""  Be kind to yourself.
*   **Take a Break:** If possible, remove yourself from the situation.  Go to a quiet place.  Listen to calming music.  (More on music later.)



**3. Preventative Strategies (To Reduce Anxiety *Before* it Starts)**

These are things you can build into your routine.

*   **Routine, Routine, Routine:**  When you're traveling, routine goes out the window easily.  Try to establish some consistency:
    *   Consistent sleep schedule (as much as possible)
    *   Regular meal times
    *   Dedicated time for exercise (even a walk)
    *   Dedicated time to connect with family (see below)
*   **Family Connection:**  This is *huge*.  Since you're away for work, schedule regular, dedicated time to connect with your family.  Video calls are best.  Make it a routine.  Talk about your day, listen to their day, share experiences.  Knowing you have that connection can be incredibly grounding.
*   **Mindfulness & Meditation:** Even 5-10 minutes a day can make a difference.  There are tons of free apps (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer).  Mindfulness helps you become aware of your thoughts and feelings without judgment.
*   **Exercise:**  Physical activity is a natural anxiety reliever.  Even a brisk walk can help.

"I have been noticing myself really enjoying watching/reading about gay or lesbian couples. I've also been imagining what it might be like to date a girl, and I like the idea. I also find guys cute too. Does this make me bisexual?",Hello!  Thank you for your question.  Exploring your sexual orientation and attraction is a wonderful opportunity to get to know yourself!  I would be curious to know what feelings you might have related to the possibility of being bi; What messages you may have received related to this orientation and any concerns you have about possible sexual orientations.,"Okay, this is a really common and important question! It's great that you're taking the time to explore your feelings. Here's a breakdown of what you're describing and how it relates to bisexuality (and other possibilities), along with some things to keep in mind.  I'll try to be thorough, but remember I'm an AI and can't *tell* you what your sexuality is – only you can figure that out.

**What you're experiencing sounds like a very valid exploration of attraction.**  Finding yourself drawn to both men *and* women (and in your case, specifically enjoying content about and imagining relationships with both) is a key component of bisexuality. However, it's also important to understand that sexuality is complex and doesn't always fit neatly into labels.

**Here's a closer look at bisexuality and other possibilities:**

* **Bisexuality:**  Bisexuality is attraction to *more than one* gender.  Critically, it doesn't have to be 50/50. It doesn't mean you're attracted to all genders all the time, or that you experience attraction equally. It can fluctuate. It can be a stronger attraction to one gender at different points in your life.  The key is that there's attraction to more than one.
* **Pansexuality:** This is often described as attraction regardless of gender.  Pansexual people may ""see"" someone as a person first, and gender isn't a determining factor in their attraction. While similar to bisexuality, some people find pansexuality fits their experience better if they feel gender isn't a relevant factor *at all*.
* **Queer:** This is an umbrella term that some people use to identify as not strictly heterosexual. It can be a comfortable label for those who feel other labels don't quite fit.
* **Fluid:**  Some people's attraction changes over time. This is sometimes referred to as sexual fluidity.  You might feel more attracted to men now, and more attracted to women later, or it might shift more frequently.
* **Heteroflexibility:** Primarily attracted to the opposite gender, but with some attraction to the same gender.
* **Homoflexibility:** Primarily attracted to the same gender, but with some attraction to the opposite gender.
* **It's okay to *not* label yourself:** You don't *need* a label if you don't want one. It's perfectly fine to say ""I'm attracted to people, and I'm still figuring things out.""

**Why your feelings suggest potential bisexuality (or something similar):**

* **Enjoyment of LGBTQ+ Content:**  Actively seeking out and enjoying stories about same-sex relationships is often a sign of underlying attraction or curiosity. It's not just about enjoyment of a good story; it's about *why* those stories resonate with you.
* **Imagining Relationships with Women:** Fantasizing about romantic or sexual scenarios with women is a significant indicator.  Fantasies often reflect underlying desires.
* **Finding Men Attractive Too:** The fact that you still experience attraction to men doesn't negate the attraction to women. Bisexuality *includes* attraction to men.
* **Curiosity:** Simply questioning and exploring your feelings is a natural part of the process!



**Important Things to Remember:**

* **Experimentation is okay (when safe and consensual):**  You don't need to have had physical experiences with both genders to know your sexuality. However, if you *want* to explore further, that's okay, as long as it's with consenting adults and you're prioritizing your safety and well-being.
* **Labels are for *you*, not others:**  Choose a label that feels right for *you*, if you choose to use one at all. Don't feel pressured to identify in a way that doesn't feel authentic.
* **Sexuality can be fluid:** Your feelings might change over time, and that's perfectly normal.
* **Don't feel like you need to ""pick a side.""**  Bisexuality isn't ""half gay"" or ""half straight."" It's a valid orientation in its own right.
* **Internalized Bi-Erasure:** Be aware that bisexuality can sometimes be invalidated or misunderstood.  There's a harmful stereotype that bisexual people are ""greedy"" or ""confused.""  These are untrue and harmful.
* **It's okay to be unsure!**  It's perfectly fine to say, ""I'm questioning"" or ""I'm still figuring things out.""  This is a journey of self-discovery.



**What to do next:**

* **Self-Reflection:**  Continue to pay attention to your feelings. What",0.48053935170173645,1.8621802860351228e-155,0.06753246753246754,0.20735277626477844
"I've tried working out and eating fruits and vegetables, but I always seem to eat the junk in the house.","I know some people do better when they don't have as much junk food in the house. This is not as tempting then. Having said that, maybe you can reward yourself with different things, such as having dessert on certain days. If you are concerned about mostly eating habits, consider seeing a nutritionist. They can help you find the balance between what it is that you really want and your goals. I'm not sure how this links to happiness for you, but hopefully looking at your choices can lead you toward your goal of being healthier.","Okay, that's *super* common! You're definitely not alone in this. It's great that you're *trying* to work out and eat healthy, that's the biggest step.  It sounds like the environment is working against you. Let's break down why this happens and then look at a bunch of strategies. We'll cover psychology, practical changes, and habit building.  I'll give a lot of ideas - pick and choose what feels doable for *you* right now.  Don't try to overhaul everything at once!

**Why This Happens: Understanding the Struggle**

* **Convenience:** Junk food is designed to be hyper-palatable (delicious, easy to eat) and readily available. It requires zero effort.  An apple needs washing, maybe cutting. Chips are right there.
* **Emotional Eating:**  Are you reaching for junk food when you're stressed, bored, sad, or even just a little bit tired? This is a HUGE factor for many people.
* **Habit & Reward System:**  Your brain learns to associate junk food with a quick dopamine hit (pleasure).  Those habits are strong.
* **Restriction Backfire:**  If you're *too* restrictive with your diet, it can lead to intense cravings and ultimately, overeating when you do ""give in.""
* **Visibility & Proximity:** If it's in your face, you're more likely to eat it.  Out of sight, out of mind actually works!
* **Household Dynamics:** Are other people in your house regularly buying/eating junk food? That makes it much harder.



**Okay, let's get into the strategies. I'm breaking it down into sections:**

**1. Environmental Changes: Making Your Home Work *For* You**

This is the most impactful place to start.  Think of your kitchen as a battlefield. You want to minimize the temptation.

* **Out of Sight, Out of Mind:**  This is #1.  Seriously.
    * **Relocate:**  Move all the junk food to the *least* accessible place possible.  High cupboards, the garage (if temperature is okay), a locked container (if needed!).  Make it require actual effort to get to.
    * **Don't Buy It (or Buy Less):** This is the obvious one, but it's hard.  Start small.  Instead of a family-sized bag of chips, buy a single serving size (if you have to have it).  Or better yet, skip it this week.
    * **Rearrange Your Pantry/Cupboards:** Put healthy snacks at eye level and in easy-to-reach spots.  The less you see of the bad stuff, the better.
* **Healthy Swaps - Make Them Obvious:**
    * **Fruit Bowl:**  A visually appealing bowl of fruit on the counter.  Make it colorful and inviting.
    * **Pre-Cut Veggies:**  Carrots, celery, bell peppers, cucumber already washed and cut up in the fridge.  Grab-and-go.
    * **Healthy Snack Containers:** Portion out nuts, seeds, yogurt, or air-popped popcorn into small containers so you're not mindlessly eating from a large bag.
* **Hydration Station:** Keep a water bottle filled and visible. Often, thirst is mistaken for hunger.
* **Clear Counters:** A cluttered kitchen can contribute to a feeling of overwhelm, which can trigger emotional eating.

**2. Psychological Strategies:  Changing Your Relationship with Food**

* **Identify Your Triggers:** Keep a food diary (even for a few days) and note *when* you crave junk food, *how* you're feeling, *where* you are, and *what's going on*.  Patterns will emerge.  (""I always crave chocolate after a stressful work call."")
* **Mindful Eating:**  When you *do* eat something, really *eat* it.  
    * **Slow Down:**  Put your fork down between bites.
    * **Savor the Flavor:** Pay attention to the taste, texture, and smell.
    * **No Distractions:**  Turn off the TV, put away your phone.
* **Don't Deprive Yourself Completely (The 80/20 Rule):**  Allow yourself small treats occasionally.  Completely restricting foods can lead to binges.  Aim for 80% healthy, 20% ""fun"" foods.  Plan these treats – don't let them be spontaneous.
* **Challenge Your Thoughts:**  When you have a craving, ask yourself: ""Am I actually *hungry*, or am I just bored/stressed/sad?""  ""Will this truly make me feel better long-term?""
* **Practice Self-",0.4887418746948242,2.620814297374497e-155,0.0774365821094793,0.25382553349994036
I feel really uncomfortable when I have people's attention.  It makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class. Can I get over this social anxiety?,"you can learn lots of skills/techniques to feel more confident in what you need to do that will decrease your anxious response for sure! :) And  you can also learn how to work with your personality that may not like the attention. You may find that ""talking"" to others through the internet is more comfortable and you are great at it, or that you love one on one talking but aren't really made for group talking. There is a place in this world for you either way! Public speaking skills can be practiced in speech class, or toastmaster group, they will give you practice in a safe environment where the cool kids or cutest boy aren't ready to laugh at you.  What topics are you interested in and what groups can you do a little speaking up? Maybe in your small group at church try and raise you hand to share your opinion, or maybe your Girl Scout troop? Look around for a peer and one adult who you like to hear speak out, ask them to share with you 2 things that help them feel comfortable speaking in public. Check out some Ted Talks and see how they share in groups. Social anxiety is a difficult concern and picking apart what is your awesome personality and what needs skill building and mindfulness/anxiety  help are important steps. Good luck!","Okay, it's *completely* understandable that you feel uncomfortable when you're the center of attention. It's a really common experience, and you're definitely not alone in this. The fact that you recognize it and want to work on it is a fantastic first step! It sounds like you're describing a form of social anxiety, and yes, absolutely, it *can* be gotten over, or at least managed to the point where it doesn't control your life. It takes work, but it's very possible.

Here's a breakdown of things to consider, strategies to try, and resources to look into.  I'll organize it into sections: Understanding, Coping Strategies, Building Confidence, and When to Seek Professional Help.  This is a long response, but I want to be thorough!

**1. Understanding What's Happening**

* **It's Anxiety, Not Just Shyness:** Shyness is a personality trait, while anxiety involves fear and a physical response.  The discomfort you feel – the racing heart, sweaty palms, blanking on thoughts – are all physical signs of anxiety.  Recognizing it as anxiety can help you treat it as something that can be addressed.
* **The Root of the Fear:**  Try to pinpoint *what* specifically makes you uncomfortable. Is it the fear of:
    * **Judgment:** Worrying about what others think of you (most common).
    * **Saying Something Stupid:**  Fear of making a mistake or not sounding intelligent.
    * **Looking Awkward:** Worrying about your body language or how you appear.
    * **Being Criticized:**  Fear of negative feedback.
    * **Failure:**  Feeling like you won't be able to meet expectations.
* **The Spotlight Effect:** We tend to overestimate how much others are noticing and judging us.  This is called the ""spotlight effect.""  People are often more focused on themselves than on analyzing you.
* **Negative Thought Patterns:** Anxiety often fuels negative thoughts. (""I'm going to mess up."" ""Everyone will think I'm an idiot."")  These thoughts aren't facts, they're interpretations.



**2. Coping Strategies for Immediate Discomfort**

These are things you can try *in the moment* when you feel anxious:

* **Deep Breathing:**  This is huge.  Slow, deep breaths activate your parasympathetic nervous system (the ""calm down"" system).  Try box breathing: inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4. Repeat.
* **Grounding Techniques:**  Bring yourself back to the present moment. 
    * **5-4-3-2-1:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Feel Your Feet:**  Pay attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground.
* **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:**  Tense and then release different muscle groups in your body, starting with your toes and working your way up.
* **Mindful Observation:**  Instead of getting caught up in your thoughts, try to observe the situation as if you were a neutral observer.  Notice the room, the people, the colors.
* **Acceptance (Not Approval):**  Acknowledge the anxiety.  Say to yourself, ""I'm feeling anxious right now, and that's okay.""  You don't need to *like* it, but accepting it reduces the struggle against it.
* **Have a ""Safe"" Thought:** Prepare a short, positive phrase or image to focus on when anxiety hits.  Something like, ""I am capable,"" or visualizing a calming scene.



**3. Building Confidence & Reducing Anxiety Long-Term**

These take more time and consistent effort:

* **Start Small - Exposure Therapy (Gradual):**  This is the *most effective* technique for overcoming social anxiety. The idea is to gradually expose yourself to situations that make you anxious, starting with the least frightening and working your way up.  
    * **Example:**
        1. **Very Easy:**  Make eye contact with a cashier when you pay for something.
        2. **Easy:**  Say ""Good morning"" to a neighbor.
        3. **Medium:**  Ask a simple question in class (e.g., ""Can you repeat that?"").
        4. **Harder:**  Answer a question in class, even if you're not 100% sure of the answer.
        5. **Hardest:**  Give a short presentation.
    * **Important:**  Don't move to the next step until you feel relatively comfortable with the previous one.

"I've been bulimic for about 6 years now. I'm in my early 20s. I am about to start back to school to become an RN, and I really need to get better once and for all.    I lose control of myself and become angry and anxious and just eat and purge. Over and over. Can someone please point me in the right direction for help?","Eating disorders usually result from a sense of insecurity about who the person is, whether they are good enough compared with anyone else, and whether the way they person lives is effective.If you have a style you're already happy with to reflect on these sorts of topics, keep following your own logic with the aim to free yourself, which usually takes place gradually, from these sort of self-doubts.The other approach would be to find an unperson or an online discussion group where you'd be able to offer and receive the support from other people who live with a similar problem.Good luck in your studies!","Okay, this is incredibly brave of you to acknowledge this and to *want* to get better, especially with the added stress of starting nursing school. That takes a lot of strength.  It's fantastic that you're recognizing this needs to be addressed *before* starting this demanding program.  Nursing school is hard enough without the added burden of an eating disorder.  Here's a breakdown of how to get help, covering different levels of care and resources, geared specifically towards your situation.  I'll also address the anger and anxiety piece.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am not a medical professional.**

**1. Immediate Support & Crisis Lines (Right Now):**

*   **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text 988.  Even if you're not actively suicidal, they can provide immediate support and connect you with resources.  Eating disorders often co-occur with suicidal thoughts, and it's important to have this available.  https://988lifeline.org/
*   **The Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741.  Similar to 988, but via text.  Good if you prefer that method. https://www.crisistextline.org/
*   **National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) Helpline:** 1-800-931-2237.  They can offer support, resources, and referrals to treatment providers.  They also have a chat function on their website.  https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/
*   **The Emily Program Helpline:** 1-888-364-5977. Offers assessment, support, and information. https://www.emilyprogram.com/



**2. Levels of Treatment - Finding What Fits You (and Your Future RN Schedule):**

You'll want to consider what level of care is appropriate based on the severity of your bulimia and your ability to maintain a routine while starting school.

*   **Outpatient Therapy:** This is a great starting point, and can be done *while* starting school (though it requires good time management).
    *   **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-E):**  Specifically designed for eating disorders. It helps you identify and change the thoughts and behaviors that drive the cycle of bingeing and purging.  *This is considered the gold standard treatment.*
    *   **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):**  Excellent for managing the intense emotions (like anger and anxiety) you described. DBT teaches skills for emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness. This is *very* helpful alongside CBT-E.
    *   **Psychodynamic Therapy:**  Can explore underlying emotional issues that contribute to the eating disorder.
    *   **Finding a Therapist:** Look for therapists specializing in eating disorders.  Psychology Today has a good directory where you can filter by specialization and insurance: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists
*   **Nutritional Counseling:**  Essential! A registered dietitian (RD) specializing in eating disorders can help you:
    *   Develop a regular eating pattern.
    *   Challenge food rules and beliefs.
    *   Address any nutritional deficiencies caused by purging.
    *   Re-establish a healthy relationship with food.
*   **Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP):**  More structured than individual therapy and nutritional counseling.  Typically involves group therapy, individual therapy, and meal support several times a week.  May be a good option if you need more support but can't commit to residential treatment.  This could be challenging to balance with school, but *might* be manageable depending on the program's schedule.
*   **Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP):**  Even more intensive than IOP, often full-day programs.  Less common for bulimia unless it's very severe.
*   **Residential Treatment:**  The most intensive level of care.  You live at a treatment facility and receive 24/7 support.  This is usually reserved for medically unstable cases or when outpatient treatment has failed.  Realistically, this is probably not feasible while starting school, but keep it in mind if things worsen significantly.

**3. Addressing the Anger and Anxiety:**

You specifically mentioned anger and anxiety as triggers.  This is *crucial* to address alongside the eating disorder.

*   **Therapy (CBT/DBT):** As mentioned above, both CBT and DBT are very effective for managing these emotions.
*   **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:**  Things like meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, or progressive muscle relaxation can help calm your nervous system and reduce anxiety. There are many apps available (Headspace, Calm, etc.).
*   **",0.467938095331192,2.2738289036624256e-155,0.0845442536327609,0.19818063677712802
I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?,It is absolutely a typical response.  Many of my clients are nervous the first couple of times we meet.  This is essentially a stranger with whom you are sharing your feelings.,"Okay, it's *completely* normal to feel nervous and shaky going to therapy, even after a few sessions! You're definitely not alone in this, and it's good you're asking about it. Here's a breakdown of why it happens, whether it's something to expect to lessen, and what you can do about it.

**Why You're Likely Feeling This Way:**

* **Vulnerability:** Therapy requires you to be vulnerable – to talk about things that are often difficult, painful, or embarrassing.  That's inherently nerve-wracking for most people. You're letting someone *in*.
* **Uncertainty:** Even after a couple of sessions, you might still be unsure of the process, unsure of your therapist's reactions, and unsure of *what* will come up.  That uncertainty fuels anxiety.
* **Facing Difficult Emotions:** Therapy often means confronting emotions you might have been avoiding. Your nervous system is reacting to the anticipation of that emotional work.  Shakiness is a physical manifestation of anxiety.
* **Power Dynamic (Initially):**  There can be an initial power dynamic in therapy, even though a good therapist works to minimize it. You're sharing, and they're listening and offering insights.  This can feel a bit intimidating.
* **Past Experiences:**  Past experiences with sharing personal information (even outside of therapy) can influence your reaction.  If you've been judged or dismissed in the past, you might anticipate that happening again.
* **It's *Working*:**  Believe it or not, sometimes nervousness means the therapy is hitting on something important!  If you're feeling anxious, it could be because you're getting closer to addressing something significant.



**Should You *Still* Be Feeling Like This?**

After a few sessions, the intensity *should* ideally start to lessen. However, ""should"" is a tricky word. There’s no rigid timeline. 

* **Normal Progression:** Many people experience a decrease in anxiety after they begin to build rapport with their therapist and feel a little more comfortable.  
* **Complex Issues:** If you're dealing with significant trauma, deep-seated issues, or a lot of emotional pain, the nervousness might linger longer.  It's not a sign of failure; it's a sign of the weight of what you're working through.
* **Therapist Fit:**  It's possible the nervousness is partly due to *not* feeling a strong connection with your therapist.  If you don't feel safe, understood, or respected, anxiety will naturally be higher. (More on this below).



**What You Can Do About It:**

1. **Talk to Your Therapist!** This is the *most* important thing.  Tell them exactly what you're experiencing: ""I've noticed I still get really nervous and shaky before and during our sessions.  I'm wondering if that's normal, and if there's anything we can do to help me feel more comfortable.""  A good therapist will:
    * **Normalize it:** Reassure you that it's a common experience.
    * **Explore the source:** Help you understand *why* you're feeling anxious.
    * **Adjust the pace:**  Maybe slow things down a bit, especially if you feel pushed to share too much too soon.
    * **Check in regularly:** Ask you about your comfort level throughout the session.

2. **Grounding Techniques:**  These can help manage the physical symptoms of anxiety *before* and *during* sessions:
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Practice deep, slow breaths.  (Box breathing – inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4 – is great).
    * **Mindful Observation:**  As you walk to the appointment, pay attention to your surroundings – notice colors, sounds, textures.  This pulls you into the present moment.
    * **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:**  Tense and release different muscle groups.
    * **Sensory Grounding:** Bring a small, comforting object with you (a smooth stone, a piece of jewelry) to hold.

3. **Journaling:**  Write down your thoughts and feelings before the session.  This can help you process them and identify what's triggering your anxiety.

4. **Self-Compassion:**  Be kind to yourself!  You're doing something brave and challenging.  Acknowledge your anxiety without judgment.  Tell yourself things like, ""It's okay to be nervous.  I'm taking care of myself by being here.""

5. **Pre-Session Routine:**  Create a calming routine before each session:
    * Listen to relaxing music.
    * Drink a cup of herbal tea.
    * Go for a",0.44107839465141296,1.0978609027761644e-155,0.04178272980501392,0.08581235697940505
"I can't even smile or fake one. I can't feel happiness about anything and I can't show love towards another person not even my girlfriend. I hate myself sometimes. All I see is ugly.
   I can't get over the loss of a loved one and I'm not close to my family. What can I do?","Trust and believe your own feelings.Emotions are real and reflect how someone feels about a situation.Since you're sad about losing a loved one, be patient w your feelings about this.  Basically, be guided by how you feel and eventually you will feel different emotions which I hope will be happier ones.","Okay, this sounds incredibly painful and difficult. It takes a lot of courage to even *say* these things, so I want to acknowledge that first. You're clearly hurting deeply, and it's completely understandable that you're struggling. It's also really important that you *did* reach out, even just by writing this. That's a first step, and it means a part of you wants things to be different.

Let's break down what you've said and talk about some potential steps.  I'm going to give a lot of information, so please don't feel like you need to do everything at once.  Even picking one small thing to focus on can be a good start.  **Important Disclaimer at the end, too, please read it.**

**1. Understanding What You're Experiencing:**

* **Grief:** The loss of a loved one is devastating, and grief is a very individual process. There's no timeline for it, and it can manifest in so many ways – not just sadness, but also numbness, anger, guilt, difficulty concentrating, loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, and even physical symptoms. It sounds like your grief is still very raw and affecting many areas of your life.
* **Depression:**  The inability to feel happiness, the self-hatred, seeing only negativity, and difficulty showing affection are all classic symptoms of depression. It's possible your grief has developed into a depressive disorder, or that you were already vulnerable to depression and the loss triggered it.  It's crucial to recognize this isn't a personal failing; it's an illness.
* **Lack of Support:** The fact that you're not close to your family makes this even harder.  Family is often a primary source of support during times of grief and emotional distress.  Without that, you're carrying a heavier burden.
* **Emotional Numbness/Alexithymia:**  Sometimes, after trauma or significant loss, people experience emotional numbness – an inability to feel emotions, even positive ones. This can be a protective mechanism, but it also prevents healing.  There's a related trait called alexithymia, which is difficulty *identifying* and *describing* emotions.

**2. What You Can Do - Starting Points:**

* **Seek Professional Help (This is the most important step):**  I know it's hard, and maybe you've tried before, but *please* consider talking to a therapist or counselor.  Here's why:
    * **Diagnosis:** A professional can accurately diagnose what's going on – is it complicated grief, depression, something else?  Knowing what you're dealing with is the first step to getting better.
    * **Therapy:**  Therapy (like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - CBT, or grief counseling) can give you tools to process your grief, challenge negative thought patterns, and learn healthy coping mechanisms.  It can also help you explore *why* you're having difficulty with emotions and connection.
    * **Medication:**  If a doctor determines it's appropriate, medication (antidepressants) can help rebalance brain chemistry and make it easier to engage in therapy and other self-help strategies.
    * **Safe Space:** A therapist provides a safe, non-judgmental space to explore your feelings.
* **Small, Achievable Goals:** When you're deeply depressed, even getting out of bed can feel impossible.  Start with *tiny* goals:
    * **Today:** Take a shower.  Drink a glass of water.  Open a window.  Listen to one song.
    * **This Week:**  Go for a short walk.  Prepare a simple meal.  Reach out to a friend (even just a text).
* **Re-engage with Things You Used to Enjoy (Even if you don't feel like it):**  I know you said you can't feel happiness, but *doing* things that used to bring you joy can sometimes, even subtly, start to shift your mood.  Don't put pressure on yourself to enjoy it; just try it.
* **Self-Compassion:**  You said you hate yourself.  That's the depression talking.  Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend who was going through this.  Challenge those negative self-thoughts.  Ask yourself: ""Would I say this to someone I care about?""
* **Mindfulness & Grounding Techniques:** When you're overwhelmed by negative thoughts, mindfulness can help you focus on the present moment.  Grounding techniques (like naming 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste) can bring you back to reality. There are apps",0.4867364466190338,2.785894492257671e-79,0.0517464424320828,0.14072119613016712
"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","From your initial description, I would say that your mother is ""Maloriented"". In this stage of Alzheimer's individuals tend to be blaming and difficult to deal with. They may often hide or throw things away and then blame family members for this. In addition, if they are incontinent, they may blame a leaky roof or something else when they are wet. You are correct that this is not her fault, but often for family members this does not make it any easier for you to cope. I strongly suggest that you learn communication strategies that will help you to communicate with your mother in a way that lets her work through the difficulties associated with the disease. I always suggest Validation techniques to family members.In addition, you need to give yourself some kind attention and take time out from your circumstances as needed. You need to be able to center yourself and come to acceptance that this is your mother's illness that is the problem, not her and certainly not you.","Okay, this is *incredibly* common, and you are absolutely right to recognize the conflict you're feeling. It's a truly difficult situation, and it's completely understandable to be frustrated and angry, *and* to feel guilty about those feelings.  You're navigating a huge emotional challenge. Here's a breakdown of how to cope, combining practical strategies and ways to manage your emotions, broken down into sections.  I'll also include resources at the end.

**1. Understanding the ""Why"" (and Re-framing)**

* **It *is* the disease:** This is the most important thing to keep repeating to yourself. Alzheimer's doesn't just affect memory. It affects personality, judgment, impulse control, and the ability to regulate emotions. The ""nasty"" and ""mean"" behavior isn't *your mother* intentionally trying to hurt you; it's the disease altering her brain function.  Think of it like a filter has been removed.  She's saying things she wouldn't normally say, and reacting in ways that are out of character.
* **The requests are a symptom:** The unrealistic requests are often driven by confusion, disorientation, and a desperate attempt to regain a sense of control or comfort.  They don't have logical meaning because the logical part of her brain is deteriorating.  They might stem from a lost memory, a misinterpretation of reality, or simply a feeling of unease she can't articulate.
* **Loss of Dignity & Control:**  Imagine how terrifying it must be to lose your bearings, to not understand what's happening, and to be increasingly dependent on others.  Her behavior might be a (misguided) attempt to assert some control in a situation where she feels utterly powerless.
* **Re-frame your perspective:**  Instead of thinking ""She's being mean *to me*,"" try to think ""The disease is making her express herself in this way.""  This isn't about excusing the behavior, but about understanding its source.



**2. Practical Strategies for Dealing with Difficult Behavior**

* **Don't Argue or Try to Reason:** This is *crucial*.  Logic won't work. You will only escalate the situation and frustrate both of you.  Trying to convince her that something is impossible or illogical will likely lead to more agitation.
* **Validation, Not Agreement:**  Instead of saying ""That doesn't make sense,"" try saying, ""That sounds frustrating,"" or ""You must really want that.""  You're acknowledging her *feeling* without validating the unrealistic request.
* **Distraction:** This is your best friend. Redirect her attention to something else.  A favorite song, a photo album, a simple activity like folding laundry (even if it’s imperfectly done), a snack, or a walk (if she's able).
* **Simplify Communication:**  Use short, simple sentences.  Avoid complex questions.  Speak slowly and calmly.
* **Positive Physical Touch (if she allows it):**  Holding her hand, a gentle touch on the arm, or a hug (if she's receptive) can be incredibly grounding and reassuring.
* **""Yes, and..."" Technique:**  This can work for some requests.  If she asks for her mother (who is deceased), you could say, ""Yes, Mother loved flowers. Let's look at some pictures of flowers.""  You're acknowledging her desire without reinforcing the reality of the request.
* **Limit Choices:**  Too many options can be overwhelming.  Instead of ""What would you like to wear?"" try ""Would you like to wear the blue shirt or the green shirt?""
* **Identify Triggers:**  Try to notice patterns.  Is her agitation worse at certain times of day (sundowning)?  After certain activities?  When she's tired or hungry?  Knowing the triggers can help you anticipate and prevent some outbursts.
* **Safety First:** If she becomes physically aggressive, remove yourself from the situation and ensure your safety.  Don't try to restrain her, but create space.




**3. Managing *Your* Emotions**

* **Acknowledge Your Feelings:**  It's okay to be angry, frustrated, sad, exhausted, and guilty.  Don't suppress these feelings.  Denying them will only make them worse.  Say to yourself, ""I'm feeling really angry right now, and that's okay, given the situation.""
* **Self-Care is *Not* Selfish:** This is non-negotiable.  You cannot pour from an empty cup.  Schedule regular time for yourself, even if it's just 15-30 minutes a day, to do something you enjoy. This could be reading, taking a bath, listening to music, exercising, or spending time in nature",0.5229961276054382,3.1379933080099187e-155,0.11564625850340138,0.2594446973145198
"I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it.
 I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call.
 I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive. I know what I'm doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change. How do I stop this behavior and thought process?","Good for you on your keen awareness of your difficulties and your willingness to change!The type of change you'd like to achieve is possible, and since a change in self-confidence and self-love is deep rooted, this comes about gradually and slowly.Keep understanding yourself during your moments of doubt and anxiety.  Its fine to feel terrible and certainly better to know you feel insecure than to act upon the insecurity by being with men who take advantage of you.Everyone needs to feel loved and recognized.Until you attract a partner who will love and appreciate you, develop relationships with co-workers and classmates, neighbors, so that you have some quality of giving and being given by someone.It is a way to nurture yourself and another person until your strength and self-belief grow bigger.","Okay, this is a *really* important and brave step to recognize this pattern and want to change. It sounds incredibly painful, and you're right to identify that you're repeating a cycle that's hurting you. You've already done the hardest part: **awareness.** Now comes the work, and it *is* work, but it's work that will lead to a much healthier and happier you. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, broken down into sections, and I'll be thorough.  This is a complex issue, so this will be a lengthy response.  Please read it all, and consider seeking professional help (more on that at the end).

**1. Understanding the Roots: Why This Happens**

Before tackling the behavior, let's look at *why* it's happening. You've touched on some key pieces, but let's unpack them a bit more:

* **Fear of Abandonment/Being Alone:** This is the core. Your statement ""I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive"" is huge. This suggests a deep-seated fear of being alone, likely stemming from earlier experiences.  This fear overrides your rational knowledge that these relationships are harmful. It feels safer to be *in* a bad relationship than to be alone, even if the bad relationship is actually damaging.
* **Low Self-Worth:**  Believing you *need* someone to survive often connects to feeling you're not enough on your own.  This makes you more vulnerable to accepting less than you deserve.
* **Early Attachment Patterns:**  How were relationships modeled for you growing up?  Did you see healthy, equal partnerships? Or were there dynamics of control, neediness, or emotional unavailability?  These early patterns significantly influence how we relate to others.
* **The ""Fixer"" Role:** You mention hoping things will change.  This suggests you're trying to ""fix"" these men, believing your love and effort will be enough to make them into the partner you need.  This is a common pattern for people with low self-worth; they feel valuable when they are needed or when they are trying to help.
* **Gaslighting and Control Tactics:**  The accusation of *you* being controlling when you're actually being controlled is classic gaslighting. Abusers often project their own behavior onto their victims to maintain power. You've been trained to doubt your perceptions and defer to their judgment.
* **Familiarity:**  Even painful patterns can be familiar, and sometimes the brain prefers familiar (even if bad) to the uncertainty of something new and healthy.



**2. Breaking the Cycle: Practical Steps**

This isn't about willpower; it's about building new skills and rewiring your brain.

* **Therapy is Crucial:** I cannot emphasize this enough.  A therapist, *especially* one specializing in attachment, trauma, or codependency, can provide a safe space to explore the roots of your patterns, develop coping mechanisms, and build self-esteem.  Look for someone you feel comfortable with. (Resources at the end).
* **Radical Self-Care:** This isn't bubble baths (though those are nice!). This is actively focusing on *your* needs and well-being. It's about learning to be your own source of comfort and security.  Here's what that looks like:
    * **Schedule Solo Activities:** Start small.  Go for a walk alone.  Read a book in a coffee shop.  Take yourself to a movie.  Gradually increase the time you spend alone and the complexity of the activities.  The goal is to *become* comfortable with your own company.
    * **Identify Your Interests:** What did you enjoy before you started focusing on relationships? What have you *always* wanted to try?  Pursue those things, even if it feels scary or selfish.
    * **Physical Health:**  Exercise, eat nutritious food, get enough sleep.  Taking care of your body boosts your mood and self-esteem.
    * **Boundaries, Boundaries, Boundaries:**  This is the hardest part.  Start saying ""no"" to things you don't want to do, even if it disappoints someone.  Practice asserting your needs and opinions. This will feel incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it’s vital.
* **Challenge Your Thoughts:** When you find yourself justifying staying with someone who treats you poorly, challenge those thoughts. Ask yourself:
    * ""Is this thought based on fact or fear?""
    * ""What would I tell a friend who was in this situation?""
    * ""Am I minimizing the abuse?""
    * ""What do *I* want and need?""
* **Recognize Red Flags *Early*:**  Before getting emotionally invested, learn to identify warning signs of unhealthy relationships:

"I was with my friends fishing by a pond. I found a frog and stabbed it with my friend's knife. I'm not sure why I did it. My friends saw me do it it and were shocked and got really mad at me.

Now if someone brings it up I get really upset and panicked. I don't know why I feel like this. Does this mean there is something wrong with me?","The good news is your awareness that being violent to animals feels out of character for you.   I'm glad you have awareness and I'm glad you are not at ease with killing frogs.Fairly likely that you were acting out aggressively toward the frog, feelings of being on the receiving side of similar type of violence.Basically, you did unto the frog what someone has or to you, feels like, has been done to you.Use your surprising finding of how strong your anger and most likely inward pain.   Reflect on your closest relationships and how these people treat you.   It is possible you feel more hurt by someone who is close to you than you ever realized.Stabbing innocent frogs is wrong.  It is understandable as a way to show you how much inner pain you probably have.It is also wrong that someone close to you hurt you.The direction to go is to recognize your pain and then decide how to go about changing what is possible on your side of that or those relationship(s).","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's good you're reaching out and trying to understand why you're feeling this way. What you did was harmful to the frog, and it understandably upset your friends. Your reaction *now* – the upset and panic when it's brought up – is also something important to address. Let's break this down.

**First, about the act itself:**

* **It was harmful and likely cruel.**  Frogs are living creatures that can feel pain, even if it's different from how humans experience it.  Stabbing it was a violent act.
* **The ""why"" is important.** You said you don't know *why* you did it. That's a key part of understanding what's going on.  Impulsive acts like this can stem from a lot of different things.
* **Your friends' reaction was reasonable.** They were shocked and angry because they witnessed something disturbing and ethically wrong.  Their reaction is a natural response to witnessing cruelty.



**Now, let's focus on *your* reaction *after* the fact – the upset and panic.** This is where it gets more complex and suggests there's definitely something worth exploring.  Here are several reasons why you might be feeling this way:

* **Guilt and Remorse:** This is the most obvious.  Even if you didn't consciously think about the consequences at the time, you likely now recognize that what you did was wrong, and that's causing you guilt.
* **Shame:** Shame is different from guilt. Guilt is about *what you did*; shame is about *who you are*. You might be feeling ashamed of yourself, believing that this act reflects something negative about your character.  This can be a very painful feeling.
* **Distress Tolerance:**  The memory is causing you intense emotional discomfort. Your panic could be a sign that you have difficulty *managing* strong emotions.  Your body is reacting as if you are in danger when the memory surfaces.
* **Underlying Emotional Issues:**  Sometimes, impulsive acts of cruelty, especially when seemingly without clear motivation, can be a manifestation of deeper emotional struggles.  These could include:
    * **Anger:**  Were you angry about something else at the time, and the frog became an unfortunate outlet?
    * **Depression:**  Depression can sometimes manifest as irritability, numbness, or even destructive impulses.
    * **Anxiety:** High levels of anxiety can also lead to impulsive behaviors.
    * **Past Trauma:**  Experiences of trauma can sometimes lead to difficulties with emotional regulation and impulsive behavior.
* **Fear of Judgment:** You're likely worried about how your friends (and potentially others) perceive you now.  The fear of losing their respect or being seen as a ""bad person"" can be very strong.
* **Moral Conflict:** Your actions likely clashed with your own internal moral compass, creating internal distress.



**Does this mean something is ""wrong"" with you?**

Not necessarily.  Everyone makes mistakes. *However*, the intensity of your reaction *and* the fact that you can't understand *why* you did it suggest that this is more than just simple regret. It's a sign that you could benefit from talking to someone.  It doesn’t mean you’re a bad person, but it does mean there's something happening internally that needs attention.

**What should you do?**

1. **Talk to a Trusted Adult:**  This could be a parent, teacher, counselor, school psychologist, or another adult you trust.  It's important to have someone to confide in.
2. **Consider Professional Help:** *This is the most important step.*  A therapist can help you explore the underlying reasons for your behavior, develop coping mechanisms for managing difficult emotions, and address any potential underlying mental health concerns.  Look for a therapist experienced in:
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Helps identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.
    * **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):**  Focuses on emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal skills.
3. **Apologize to Your Friends:** A sincere apology to your friends is important, acknowledging the harm you caused and expressing remorse.  Don't offer excuses; simply take responsibility for your actions.  Be prepared for them to need time to process their feelings.
4. **Practice Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself.  You're grappling with difficult emotions and trying to understand your behavior.  Self-criticism will only make things worse.
5. **Avoid Similar Situations:** Be mindful of your impulses and avoid situations where you might be tempted to act out in harmful ways.

"I’m a man, and I’m soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but it’s been happening a lot. I don't know what to do.","Hello, and thank you for your question. When faced with these kinds of difficult challenges, I usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be. Indeed, it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we don't feel very content with our lives. Perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions: What kind of person do I want to be deep in my heart? What kind of character do I want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching? How would I want others to describe me? Let's say that you want others to see you as being authentic, and YOU also value authenticity as something you want to live by. You may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now. That you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart. This is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation. So please, try not to feel alone. We all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc. And I am not just talking about being unaccepted by others, but a person may have a VERY hard time accepting themselves. Thinking about your values and living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom, but I won't lie, it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time. For example, someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for, even if that means people may disapprove. That may cause a lot of pain, but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity. It may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy, which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them. I would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are... both as an individual and as someone's fiancé.Above all, I wish you well in this journey.

**1. Understanding the Severity**

Let's be very clear: what you've described is infidelity.  It's a breach of trust, and it has the potential to cause immense pain to your future spouse. Even though you haven't officially said ""I do"" yet, you are *engaged*, and that carries a significant commitment and expectation of fidelity.  Continuing this behavior while moving towards marriage will only amplify the hurt if it comes to light.  The longer it goes on, the more damage it will cause.

You're experiencing a crisis of conscience, which is why you're here. That's a positive sign, but it doesn't erase the actions that have already taken place.  Ignoring this won't make it go away; it will likely worsen and potentially destroy your relationship before it even truly begins.



**2. Immediate Steps**

* **Stop all contact with the other men.**  This is the *first* and most crucial step.  Absolutely no more meetings, messages, or any form of engagement.  Every additional instance adds to the betrayal.  Block numbers, delete apps, do whatever you need to create distance.
* **Stop all planning for the wedding.** It’s okay to put a pause on wedding plans. Continuing to plan a future built on a foundation of deceit is unfair to your future spouse and will only increase the pain when/if the truth comes out.
* **Self-Reflection (See Section 3).**  Before making any decisions about disclosure, you *need* to understand what's driving this behavior.



**3. Exploring Your Feelings (This is critical)**

You need to understand *why* this is happening.  ""It just happened"" isn't an answer.  Be brutally honest with yourself (and potentially a therapist - see Resources).  Consider these questions:

* **What needs are you meeting through these encounters that aren't being met elsewhere?**  Is it sexual? Emotional?  A sense of validation?  Excitement?  Something else?
* **What's going on in your relationship with your fiancée?**  Are you feeling disconnected?  Are there communication problems?  Are your emotional needs being met?  Are there unmet sexual needs? (Be honest - this isn’t about blaming her, it’s about understanding the situation).
* **What are your beliefs about monogamy?**  Have you always truly believed in it?  Are you struggling with internal conflict about your sexuality or desires?
* **What are your fears?**  Are you afraid of commitment?  Are you afraid of intimacy?  Are you afraid of vulnerability?
* **Is this a pattern?** Have you engaged in similar behavior in past relationships? If so, this suggests a deeper issue that needs addressing.
* **What are your values?**  Does this behavior align with the person you want to be?  What kind of husband do you want to be?



**4. Options & Considerations (This is where it gets very difficult)**

You have three primary paths, and none of them are easy:

* **A. Full Disclosure (Before the Wedding):** This is arguably the most ethical, though the most painful in the short term.
    * **How to do it:**  Choose a private, calm setting.  Be direct and honest.  Take full responsibility for your actions – no blaming or minimizing.  Be prepared for her to be angry, hurt, and potentially end the relationship.  Allow her to ask questions and answer them truthfully (as much as you can).  Emphasize your remorse and your willingness to seek help.
    * **Pros:** Allows her to make an informed decision about whether she wants to marry you.  Offers the possibility of rebuilding trust (though it will be *very* difficult and long-term).  Allows you to start marriage with honesty, if she chooses to stay.
    * **Cons:**  Very likely to end the relationship.  Will cause significant pain.  May be incredibly difficult to deliver.
* **B. Stop the Behavior and Proceed with the Wedding (Without Disclosure):** This is the most dangerous path.
    * **How to do it:**  Complete cessation of contact.  Commit to addressing the underlying issues (therapy is essential – see Resources).  This path relies on you never",0.5310741662979126,1.1109373675392065e-78,0.125552608311229,0.2742683540198045
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",Absolutely not.  I strongly recommending working on one issue/need at a time.  In therapy you will set smart goals and objectives that will help you reach your goals.  I see you as a survivor and not a victim.  Best wishes to you.,"Okay, that's a *lot* to carry, and it's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge all of this. You are absolutely not alone in having multiple, complex issues. And to have navigated life with all of this, *and* maintain a 35-year marriage? That speaks volumes about your strength and resilience.

Let me directly answer your question: **No, you absolutely do *not* have too many issues to address in counseling.**  That's a very common concern, and a misconception about how therapy works.  Therapists are *trained* to work with complexity. It's not about ""fixing"" everything at once, it's about understanding how these things interconnect and addressing what's most pressing *for you* at any given time.

Here's a breakdown of why your concerns are understandable, and why therapy can still be incredibly helpful, along with things to consider:

**Why it feels overwhelming:**

* **Trauma Stacking:** You've experienced significant trauma (sexual abuse, cancer), and chronic issues (insomnia, depression). These don't exist in isolation. They build on each other, creating a complex web of emotional and psychological responses.
* **Long-term Suppression:**  You've lived with these issues for a long time *without* dedicated support.  This often leads to things becoming deeply ingrained and feeling insurmountable.
* **Fear of Unearthing Pain:** It's natural to be scared of revisiting painful experiences. You might worry that bringing things up will make things worse.
* **The ""Too Much"" Myth:**  There's a societal pressure to be ""fixed"" neatly, and the idea of having multiple issues can feel shameful or like a burden.



**Why therapy *can* help, and how it works with complexity:**

* **It's a Process, Not a Quick Fix:** Good therapy isn't about magically eliminating problems. It's about a gradual process of exploration, understanding, and developing coping mechanisms.
* **Prioritization:** A good therapist will *work with you* to figure out what feels most urgent or accessible to address *right now*.  You don't have to tackle everything at once. You might start with the insomnia, as that impacts your daily functioning so significantly. Or you might start with the anxiety, as it's newly emerging.  Or you might gently begin exploring the impact of the past trauma.  *You* guide the pace, with the therapist's support.
* **Interconnectedness:** A skilled therapist will help you see how your experiences are linked.  For example, the trauma may be contributing to the depression and anxiety, and the insomnia may be exacerbating everything.  Addressing one area can often have a ripple effect on others.
* **Safe Space:** Therapy provides a confidential, non-judgmental space to explore difficult emotions and experiences.
* **Developing Coping Skills:** You'll learn practical tools and strategies to manage your symptoms and improve your overall well-being.
* **Strengths-Based Approach:** Despite everything you've been through, you have strengths!  Your long, happy marriage is a huge one. A therapist will help you identify and build on those strengths.




**Here's how to approach finding a therapist:**

1. **Look for Specializations:** Given your history, look for a therapist who has experience in:
   * **Trauma-Informed Care:**  This is *crucial* given the sexual abuse history.  They understand the impact of trauma and how to approach it safely.  Look for modalities like EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), Somatic Experiencing, or Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT).
   * **Depression & Anxiety:**  Experience with these is essential.
   * **Cancer Survivorship:** Some therapists specialize in the emotional challenges of cancer recovery. This isn't mandatory, but it can be helpful.
   * **Sleep Disorders:** While they won't be a sleep specialist, they can address the psychological components of your insomnia.

2. **Initial Consultations:**  Most therapists offer brief (15-30 minute) free consultations.  *Use these!*  This is your chance to:
   * **Ask about their experience:**  ""Have you worked with clients who have similar experiences to mine?""
   * **Ask about their approach:** ""What is your general approach to therapy?""  ""How do you work with trauma?""
   * **Get a feel for their personality:**  Do you feel comfortable talking to them?  Do you feel heard and understood?  *This is the most important thing.*

3. **Don't Be Afraid to ""Shop Around"":**  It's perfectly okay to talk to several therapists before finding one you feel is a good fit.  Therapy is a relationship, and it",0.4539757966995239,2.4604328562500446e-79,0.056074766355140186,0.16750108715211134
"I have three siblings. My mom loves them and not me. She’s always yelling at me, but when it comes to my siblings, she talks to them. I’m always crying in my room.","Have you ever tried talking with her about this when she's not angry? While I hear you saying that it feels like she doesn't love you, there could be a lot of other pieces to this. Have you ever told her about how much she means to you (when she's not angry)?","Okay, this sounds incredibly painful, and I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's absolutely understandable why you're crying and feeling hurt. It's a deeply upsetting experience to feel like your mother doesn't love you the same way she loves your siblings.  It's brave of you to even acknowledge this and reach out.  Here's a breakdown of how to think about this, and what you can do, broken down into sections.  It's a long response, but I want to be thorough.

**1. Understanding What's Happening (It's Not About You, Even Though It Feels Like It)**

*   **It's not your fault.** This is the most important thing to understand.  A parent's love (or lack of perceived love) is *never* a reflection of a child's worth.  You deserve love and kindness regardless of anything.
*   **Parental issues are complex.**  There are many, *many* reasons why a parent might treat children differently. It's rarely about the children themselves. Some possibilities (and these are just possibilities, *not* excuses for her behavior) include:
    *   **Her own upbringing:**  She may be repeating patterns she learned from her own parents.
    *   **Her own emotional issues:** She might be struggling with depression, anxiety, unresolved trauma, or other mental health concerns that affect her ability to connect with you.
    *   **Unconscious projections:** She might be projecting her own insecurities or frustrations onto you.
    *   **Personality clashes:** Sometimes personalities just don't mesh, and that can be difficult for a parent to navigate.
    *   **Birth order dynamics:** (While not always the case) sometimes parents fall into patterns with birth order.
*   **It's about *her*, not you.** While it's incredibly hard to separate your feelings, try to remember that her behavior is a result of *her* internal world and issues, not a failing on your part. This is incredibly hard to accept, but it's crucial for your own well-being.
*   **Recognize the abuse:** Yelling *at* someone while talking *to* others is a form of emotional abuse. It's invalidating, dismissive, and damaging.



**2. What You Can Do to Protect Yourself (Right Now)**

*   **Limit Interaction (when possible):**  This is about self-preservation. If interactions with your mother consistently leave you feeling hurt and upset, try to minimize them.  This doesn't mean cutting her off entirely (unless you feel that's necessary), but it means creating boundaries.
*   **Gray Rock Method:** This is a technique for dealing with difficult people.  When you *do* have to interact with your mother, become as uninteresting as a gray rock.  Give short, factual answers.  Avoid sharing personal information or engaging in emotional arguments.  Example:
    *   **Her:** ""Why are you always so [negative trait]?""
    *   **You:** ""Okay."" or ""I'm not sure what you mean."" (Don't get drawn into defending yourself).
*   **Create Physical Space:**  Spend time in your room, go for walks, hang out with friends – anywhere you can escape the negative energy. You already do this by crying in your room, but try to expand on that and actively seek out positive spaces.
*   **Journaling:** Write down your feelings.  This can be a safe outlet for your emotions and help you process what's happening. Don't censor yourself – just write whatever comes to mind.
*   **Self-Care:**  This is vital.  Do things that bring you joy and help you relax.  Listen to music, read a book, take a bath, practice mindfulness, exercise – anything that nourishes your soul.
* **Don't try to ""fix"" her:** You cannot change your mother's behavior.  Accepting this is painful, but freeing.  Your energy is better spent on protecting yourself and building your own happiness.

**3. Seeking Support (You Don't Have to Go Through This Alone)**

*   **Talk to a Trusted Adult:** This could be a father, another relative, a teacher, a school counselor, a coach, or a friend's parent.  Someone who will listen without judgment and offer support.  *Tell them what's happening.* Don't downplay it.
*   **Therapy:**  I *strongly* recommend therapy. A therapist can provide a safe space for you to explore your feelings, develop coping mechanisms, and build your self-esteem. They can also help you understand the dynamics in your family and set healthy boundaries.  Look for a therapist who specializes in family dynamics or trauma.",0.47756248712539673,4.0294678206384825e-79,0.0630749014454665,0.2146487087912743
"I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I can't afford to live alone.
   My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules. She is trying to control my life. What should I do?","That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now. The first thing to under is that you can’t change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior. The thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions.  You may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan. The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior. Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy. Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack.  There are ways you can deal with controlling parents – and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you’ll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they’re trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you’re losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust. There aren’t any quick tips on how to deal with parents who want to control you; you need to find strategies that are geared to your specific family situation.

It's tough balancing the need for independence with the reality of financial constraints. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, broken down into sections: **Understanding the Situation, Communication Strategies, Setting Boundaries, Financial Planning, and When to Consider Other Options.**  I'll also add a section on **Self-Care** because this is stressful.

**1. Understanding the Situation**

* **It's understandable she has rules:** Your mom likely feels a sense of responsibility for you, and having rules is her way of exerting that care (even if it feels controlling). She's providing a significant benefit by letting you live there rent-free (or at a reduced cost), and in her mind, that comes with expectations.  It doesn't *make* it right, but it helps to understand the root of her behavior.
* **You're an adult:**  You're no longer a child, and you deserve to be treated as such.  Your goals, choices, and life path are yours to navigate, even if they differ from her vision.
* **Control vs. Concern:**  Try to distinguish between rules that are genuinely about your well-being (like contributing to household chores) and rules that are about controlling your personal life (who you see, what you study, your career choices).
* **Your Financial Reality:** Be honest with yourself about your financial situation. This is a key factor influencing your options.



**2. Communication Strategies**

* **Choose the Right Time:** Don't ambush her when she's stressed or busy. Pick a calm, private moment when you both have time to talk without interruptions.
* **""I"" Statements:** This is *crucial*. Instead of saying ""You're always trying to control me!"" try ""I feel controlled when..."" or ""I need more space to make my own decisions.""  For example:
    * **Instead of:** ""You're always asking about my friends.""
    * **Try:** ""I appreciate your interest in my life, but I feel a little overwhelmed when I'm asked a lot of questions about my friends. I'd like to share when I'm ready.""
* **Acknowledge Her Perspective:** Start by acknowledging her good intentions.  ""Mom, I really appreciate you letting me live here, and I know you want what's best for me."" This softens the approach.
* **Be Specific:**  Don't be vague.  Identify *specific* rules that bother you and explain why.  ""I understand you want the house to be clean, and I'm happy to help with chores.  However, I need to manage my own schedule for studying and social activities without feeling like I need to check in constantly.""
* **Focus on the Future:** Frame the conversation around your growing independence and eventual move-out. ""I'm working towards being financially independent, and part of that is learning to manage my own life.""
* **Listen to Her:**  It's a two-way street.  Truly listen to her concerns. There might be underlying fears or expectations that you're unaware of.  Asking ""What are your biggest concerns about me living here?"" can be powerful.
* **Be Respectful (Even When It's Hard):**  Even if you disagree, maintaining a respectful tone is vital.  It makes her more likely to listen to you.




**3. Setting Boundaries**

* **Identify Your Non-Negotiables:**  What are the things you absolutely need to control? (e.g., your career path, your relationships, your free time).
* **Clearly Communicate Boundaries:** ""I'm happy to discuss my plans with you, but ultimately, the decision is mine.""  ""I need privacy in my room.""  ""I will let you know when I am out and what time I will be back.""
* **Be Consistent:** This is the hardest part.  Once you set a boundary, you *must* enforce it.  If she pushes, gently but firmly reiterate your boundary.  (e.g., ""I understand you want my opinion, but I've already made my decision on this."")
* **Expect Pushback:**  She's used to things a certain way. She likely won't change overnight. Be prepared for her to test the boundaries.
* **Consequences (for you):**  Think about what *you* will do if she repeatedly violates your boundaries.  This might be limiting information you share, spending more time away from home, or (as a last resort) starting to seriously look at alternative living arrangements.


**4. Financial Planning (This is Key!)**

* **Create a Budget:** Track your income and expenses.  Identify areas where you can save.
* **Increase Income",0.5212094187736511,7.660066548155814e-79,0.1263573543928924,0.29785182357475726
"I keep getting into relationships with men that are in bad situations. I take them on and help them and do all I can and the relationship still fails. How do I learn to not get in relationships with men in bad situations? I see someone in need of help, I jump in. And it is getting me nowhere. I am alone sad and frustrated.","Sounds like you already see what's amiss. You're looking for fix-er-uppers! When you meet these men they need you. And you're filled by fixing them.  And when they are fixed, what do they have to give you? What's your need in relationship? What if you found someone who didn't need fixing? ","Okay, this is a really common pattern, and it's *incredibly* insightful of you to recognize it. It takes a lot of self-awareness to admit you're repeatedly falling into this dynamic. You're essentially becoming a rescuer, and while your compassion is a beautiful quality, it's backfiring in your romantic life. Let's break down why this happens and, more importantly, how to change it.  This will be a bit lengthy, but I want to cover it thoroughly.

**1. Understanding the Pattern: Why It Happens**

* **The Rescuer Archetype:** You seem to embody the ""rescuer"" archetype.  Rescuers often feel good about themselves *when* they are helping others. It can boost self-esteem, give a sense of purpose, and even feel empowering.  However, the need to rescue often stems from unmet needs *within yourself*.  You might be trying to feel valuable by ""fixing"" someone else, or avoid dealing with your own issues by focusing on theirs.
* **Unconscious Motivations:**  Ask yourself honestly: what do you *get* out of being with someone who needs help?  Is it a sense of control (you're the ""strong"" one)? Does it validate your worth (they need you)? Does it avoid vulnerability in a genuinely equal partnership? These aren’t accusations, just areas to explore.
* **Early Life Experiences:** Sometimes, this pattern roots in childhood. Perhaps you grew up in a chaotic or emotionally needy environment where you had to take care of others (parents, siblings). You may have learned to equate love with caretaking, and unconsciously seek out similar dynamics.
* **Misinterpreting Attraction:** You might be confusing neediness with vulnerability.  True vulnerability is about *sharing* your authentic self, flaws and all. Neediness is often about *taking* from others emotionally.
* **Ignoring Red Flags:**  You're likely overlooking early warning signs because you're focused on the ""potential"" and the desire to help. Red flags might include:  lack of personal responsibility, blaming others, a history of failed relationships, unwillingness to seek help themselves, grand promises but little action.
* **The Illusion of Control:** You might think that by helping, you can *change* them, and therefore control the outcome of the relationship. But people can only change themselves, and attempting to change someone else is a recipe for frustration.



**2.  Breaking the Pattern: Practical Steps**

This is the hard work, but it's absolutely possible.

* **Self-Reflection & Therapy (Highly Recommended):**  This is the most important step. A therapist can help you explore the *root causes* of your rescuer tendencies. They can provide a safe space to unpack your childhood experiences, identify your unconscious motivations, and develop healthier coping mechanisms.  Look for therapists specializing in attachment theory, codependency, or relationship patterns.
* **Identify Your Boundaries:**  This is crucial. What are you willing and *not* willing to accept in a relationship?  Write them down.  Be specific.  Examples:
    * ""I will not financially support a partner who is not actively seeking employment.""
    * ""I will not tolerate being constantly relied upon to solve someone else's problems.""
    * ""I need a partner who takes responsibility for their own emotions and actions.""
    * ""I need a partner who is emotionally available and willing to reciprocate support.""
* **Slow Down!** This is HUGE.  Rescuers tend to rush into relationships.  
    * **Extended Dating Phase:**  Seriously, *extend* your dating phase.  Don't fall for the initial charm or ""hard luck story.""  Take months, not weeks, to get to know someone.
    * **Observe, Don't Immediately Intervene:** When you see someone facing challenges, *observe* how they handle them. Do they take steps to improve their situation? Do they blame others? Do they show any self-awareness?  Resist the urge to jump in and fix things.  Let them demonstrate their ability to cope.
* **Focus on Attraction to *Healthy* Qualities:**  Make a list of the qualities you truly desire in a partner – qualities that have *nothing* to do with needing to be saved.  Think about:
    * Emotional maturity
    * Self-awareness
    * Respect
    * Kindness
    * Shared values
    * Independence
* **Challenge Your Thoughts:**  When you feel drawn to someone who seems to need help, challenge your initial thoughts.  Ask yourself:
    * ""Am I feeling attracted to this person, or to the idea of 'saving' them?""
    * ""Is this a healthy dynamic, or is it setting me up for another cycle of disappointment?""
    * ""What are the potential downsides of getting involved with",0.49081429839134216,4.3484882717485723e-79,0.06815203145478374,0.19215846085866276
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",Just go! You start with the most prevalent issue by talking with your therapist. Healing one issue can have a ripple effect and heal other issues as well.,"Okay, that's a *lot* to carry, and it's incredibly brave of you to even acknowledge it all and to consider seeking help. Absolutely, unequivocally, **you do NOT have too many issues to address in counseling.**  That's a common fear people have when they've lived through significant trauma and have complex experiences.  In fact, a skilled therapist will *expect* layers, and will be equipped to help you navigate them.

Here's a breakdown of why your concerns are understandable, and why therapy is still a fantastic (and necessary) step, along with some things to consider:

**Why It Feels Like ""Too Much"":**

* **Complexity:** You're dealing with trauma (sexual abuse, cancer), long-term mental health conditions (depression, insomnia, emerging anxiety), *and* the impact of those things on your self-worth. It's not a single issue, it's an interconnected web.
* **Long-Standing Patterns:**  Many of these things have been present for a long time.  That can make you feel like they are unchangeable or that it's ""too late"" to work on them.
* **Fear of Re-Traumatization:**  Talking about sexual abuse is *hard*.  The idea of revisiting painful memories can be terrifying.
* **Feeling ""Broken"":** It's easy to feel like there's just *so much wrong* that no one could possibly help.
* **The ""Good"" Alongside the Pain:** The fact that you've had a 35-year happy marriage can lead you to feel guilty or confused about seeking help.  You might think ""I should be grateful, I shouldn't complain.""  Your happiness doesn't invalidate your pain.



**Why Therapy is Absolutely Appropriate (and will likely be *more* effective because of the complexity, not in spite of it):**

* **Interconnectedness:** A good therapist understands that these issues aren’t separate. Trauma impacts mental health, mental health impacts sleep, self-esteem influences relationships, and so on. They will help you see those connections.
* **Trauma-Informed Care:**  The best approach for you is a therapist trained in trauma-informed care. This means they understand the impact of trauma on the brain and body, and they will proceed at *your* pace. They won’t push you to talk about anything you’re not ready for.
* **Building a Foundation:** Therapy isn’t about “fixing” everything at once. It’s about building coping skills, developing self-compassion, and creating a safe space to explore your experiences.
* **Untangling the Threads:**  A therapist can help you slowly and carefully unravel the layers of your experience, understand how the past impacts the present, and develop strategies for a more fulfilling future.
* **Your Marriage is a Strength:** The fact that you have a loving marriage is a *huge* asset. Therapy can even help you communicate more effectively with your spouse and navigate these challenges together (though individual therapy is a good place to start).



**What to Look for in a Therapist:**

This is crucial. You need someone who is a good fit for *you*.  Here are some specialties and approaches to consider:

* **Trauma Therapy:** Look for therapists specializing in trauma-informed care.  Specifically:
    * **EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing):** Very effective for processing trauma.
    * **Somatic Experiencing:**  Focuses on releasing trauma stored in the body.
    * **Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT):**  Helps reframe thoughts and behaviors related to trauma.
* **Depression and Anxiety:**  Experience in treating these conditions is essential.
* **Experience with Cancer Survivors:** Some therapists specialize in the unique emotional challenges faced by cancer survivors.
* **Psychodynamic Therapy:**  Can be helpful for exploring deep-seated patterns and understanding the roots of your issues.
* **Person-Centered Therapy:**  Emphasizes empathy, unconditional positive regard, and your own self-discovery.

**Important First Steps:**

1. **Initial Consultations:**  Most therapists offer brief (15-30 minute) free consultations.  Use these to ask questions about their experience, their approach, and how they would work with someone with your history.  *Trust your gut.*  Do you feel comfortable and safe talking to them?
2. **Be Honest:**  Don't downplay your experiences.  It's okay to start slow, but be open about the things you're struggling with.
3. **Pace Yourself:** You don’t have to tell your entire life story in the first session.  Start with what feels most pressing.
4. **It's Okay to Switch:**  If you don't feel a",0.4229877293109894,1.4111877533700839e-155,0.038303693570451436,0.12168141592920355
"My wife and mother are having tense disagreements. In the past, they’ve had minor differences. For example, my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing; my mother would complain my wife is lazy.

It's good you're recognizing the escalation and wanting to do something about it. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, focusing on understanding, de-escalation, and setting boundaries.

I'll break it down into sections: Understanding the Dynamics, Immediate Steps (De-escalation), Longer-Term Strategies (Boundaries & Communication), and Self-Care for You.

**1. Understanding the Dynamics**

* **The ""Talk Back"" Moment:** This is likely the pivotal point.  Even if your mother isn't *right* in feeling upset, it clearly deeply affected her.  In many cultures and families, a daughter-in-law directly challenging a mother-in-law is seen as disrespectful, even if the intent wasn't malicious. Understanding this *perception* is crucial, even if you don't agree with it.
* **Magnification:** You're right to notice the magnification. This is a classic sign of a relationship that's become emotionally charged.  Small things now represent larger, unresolved feelings. It's not about the dishes being left; it's about feeling respected (or not).
* **Underlying Needs:**  Dig beneath the surface complaints.
    * **Your Mother:** Her ""overbearing"" behavior might stem from a need to feel needed, a desire to help (even if it's unwanted), or a fear of losing her role in your life.  Her ""lazy"" comment might be a value judgment about how she thinks things *should* be done.  It could also be a projection of her own insecurities.
    * **Your Wife:**  Her complaints about your mother's overbearing nature likely come from a need for autonomy, respect for her choices, and to establish her own space within the family. She may feel judged or not appreciated.
* **Your Role (Unintentional Complication):**  You being the link between them *can* unintentionally exacerbate things. They might both try to ""win you over"" or use you as a messenger, which fuels the conflict.



**2. Immediate Steps (De-escalation - When Things are Heating Up)**

* **Separate & Cool Down:** The *moment* you sense an argument brewing or happening, gently but firmly intervene.  Something like:  ""Okay, everyone, let's take a break. This is getting heated, and we're not going to resolve anything when we're upset.""  (This is key – *before* it's a full-blown fight).  Physically separate them if possible.
* **Don't Take Sides:**  This is *hard*.  Resist the urge to defend either one.  Saying things like, ""Mom, I'm sure she didn't mean it that way"" or ""Honey, she's just trying to help"" will only make the other person feel invalidated.  Neutral statements are best: ""I understand why you're both frustrated.""  ""I can see this is important to both of you.""
* **Validate Feelings (Without Agreeing with the Content):**  ""Mom, I hear that you're feeling disrespected.""  ""Honey, it sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed."" Validation is *not* agreement. It’s acknowledging their emotion.
* **Change the Subject:**  Distraction can work in the moment. ""Hey, did you see that [sports game/news story/funny video]?"" or ""I was thinking about [upcoming event] and wanted to get your thoughts.""
* **""I Need to Think"" Response:** If pressed for an opinion, say, ""I need a little time to process what you both are saying.  Let's revisit this later."" This buys you time to avoid saying something you'll regret.

**3. Longer-Term Strategies (Boundaries & Communication)**

* **Individual Conversations (Essential):**
    * **With Your Wife:**  ""Honey, I've noticed things have been really strained with Mom lately, and I'm worried.  I want us to be a strong team, and I want you to feel comfortable and respected in our family.  How can we work on this together?"" *Listen* to her without interrupting or getting defensive.  Ask her what *she* needs from you.
    * **With Your Mother:**  ""Mom, I love you, and I value our relationship.  I've also noticed things are difficult with [Wife's Name], and it's causing stress for everyone. I need to ask that you both try to communicate with more respect for each other's feelings.  I'm worried about the impact this is having."" *Be prepared for her to be defensive*.  Stay calm and reiterate your",0.45952731370925903,6.079710938777827e-79,0.11004784688995216,0.2727923996792457
"I am on the track and softball team. My school is small, so I play all four sports it offers. I feel obligated to do track because I'm not a horrible runner, and my dad wants me to. The catch is is that the days before a track meet and the morning of, I get sick and cry.","It sounds like you are no longer committed to track emotionally.  It can be hard to talk to your dad about this, but he may think you love track and may not know you are getting so upset the days of meets.  An idea would be to first write a letter to your dad to see what feelings come out and then preparing to speak with him.  I think he will appreciate your honesty and maybe this conversation will bring you relief and also time to find something you really will enjoy.  ","Okay, this sounds really tough. You're carrying a lot! It's admirable that you're committed to your school and willing to participate in all the sports, but it's *very* clear something isn't right when it's consistently causing you physical and emotional distress. Let's break this down and figure out how to approach it. Here's a structured way to think through this, and some things you can do. I'll cover the emotional, the physical, and how to talk to people.

**1. Understanding What's Happening – It's Not Just About Track**

* **The Physical Symptoms (Getting Sick):** This is *not* normal. Consistent sickness before a stressful event is a huge red flag. It could be a few things:
    * **Stress-Induced Illness:** Your body is literally reacting to the stress of the situation. This manifests physically (nausea, stomach upset, headaches, etc.). This is common, but not something to ignore.
    * **Anxiety:**  The crying and feeling unwell point strongly to anxiety.  The anticipation of the track meet is triggering a strong emotional and physical response.
    * **It's a Signal:** Your body might be trying to tell you something. It's screaming ""I don't want to do this!"" in the only way it knows how.
* **The Emotional Component (Crying):** This isn't just being upset about a race.  Crying is a release of pent-up emotion. You're likely feeling:
    * **Pressure:**  The pressure to perform, to please your dad, to fulfill an obligation.
    * **Resentment:** You likely resent being in track, even if you don’t consciously think of it that way. You’re doing it for reasons *other* than wanting to.
    * **Overwhelm:** Four sports is *a lot* for anyone, especially in a small school where you likely don't have a ton of support staff. You're probably exhausted.
    * **Lack of Control:** You feel trapped by the obligation.

**2.  Prioritizing Your Well-being – This is Key**

You're experiencing a real problem that's impacting your health.  You *need* to prioritize your well-being.  Here's what that looks like:

* **Acknowledge Your Feelings:**  The first step is to admit to yourself that this isn't okay. It's okay to not enjoy something, even if others think you should.  It’s also okay to feel overwhelmed.
* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself. You're trying your best, but your best might mean making some changes. Don't beat yourself up for feeling this way.
* **Rest and Recovery:**  Four sports leaves little room for proper rest.  Are you getting enough sleep?  Eating well?  Taking time to de-stress? These are foundational for your physical and mental health.



**3.  Talking to People – The Hard Part, But Crucial**

This is where it gets difficult, but it's the most important step.  You need to communicate. Here’s a breakdown of *who* to talk to and *how*.  I'll give scripts as examples, but adapt them to your own voice.

* **Your Parents (Especially Your Dad):** This will likely be the hardest conversation, but it's the most important.
    * **Timing:** Choose a calm moment, not right before or after a meet.
    * **Focus on ""I"" Statements:** This avoids blaming and makes it about *your* experience.
    * **Example Script:** ""Dad, I need to talk to you about track. I appreciate you encouraging me to participate, and I know you want me to be well-rounded. But honestly, I've been getting really sick and upset before and during track meets.  It's not just nerves, it's making me physically ill, and I'm crying because I feel so much pressure and stress.  I'm worried about my health, and I don't think I can continue with track without it really impacting me.  I still want to play softball and be involved in school, but I need to prioritize my well-being.""
    * **Be Prepared for Resistance:** He may not understand immediately. Be patient, reiterate your feelings, and emphasize the physical symptoms.  ""It's not about quitting, it's about taking care of myself.""
* **Your Coach:** Let your track coach know what's going on. They may be able to offer support or adjust your training.
    * **Example Script:** “Coach, I wanted to let you know I’ve been struggling with some anxiety and physical symptoms before meets. I’m committed",0.4743468165397644,5.735981553200633e-79,0.09169764560099132,0.265635507733692
"I can't seem to feel any emotion except anxiety, not even for myself.","Empathy is the ability
to tap into our own experience to help us connect with others in order to be
aware of how they are experiencing life. 
It is a skill that we learn with practice and refine as we become mature.
If you are feeling anxious, maybe you are able to understand better others who
are going trough anxiety.  But I wonder
if instead of feeling empathy, you may just want to find ways to reduce your
anxiety.  A good idea is to be very aware
of your anxiety triggers, and once you identify them explore other ways you
could react. ¿Sera normal que no sienta empatía?Parece que no puedo experimentar ninguna otra emoción que
no sea ansiedad, ni si quiera por mí misma. Empatía es la habilidad de usar tus propias
experiencias para conectarte con otros y estar consciente de la manera que
ellos experimentan la vida.  Es una
destreza interpersonal que aprendemos y refinamos con la práctica y según maduramos
como personas.  Si te estás sintiendo
ansioso, tal vez puedas comprender mejor como otra persona experimenta momentos
de ansiedad.  Pero me pregunto si en
lugar de estar buscando sentir empatía, realmente quisieras reducir tus niveles
de ansiedad.  Una buena manera es estar consciente
que activa la ansiedad, y ya que lo identifiques, explora que otras reacciones
pudieras tener.","Okay, this sounds really tough. Feeling *only* anxiety, and even a disconnect from emotions regarding yourself, is a significant experience. It's good you're recognizing this and reaching out, even if it's just to put it into words here.  It's not ""normal"" to feel this way, and it definitely warrants attention. Here's a breakdown of what might be happening, why, and what you can do, broken down into sections.  Please read the **Important Disclaimer** at the end.

**1. Understanding What's Happening: Emotional Numbing & Alexithymia**

* **Emotional Numbing:** Anxiety, especially chronic anxiety, can sometimes lead to emotional numbing.  It's like your system gets overwhelmed and shuts down access to other feelings *as a protective mechanism*.  It's almost as if your brain says, ""Too much, need to shut down feeling everything."" This can manifest as a general flatness, difficulty experiencing joy, sadness, anger, or even care.
* **Alexithymia:** This is a personality construct characterized by difficulty identifying *and* describing emotions.  It's not the same as lacking emotions; it's lacking the *awareness* of them.  People with alexithymia often struggle to connect with their own feelings and those of others. It can be a lifelong trait or develop as a result of trauma or chronic stress.
* **Depersonalization/Derealization:** These are dissociative experiences where you feel detached from yourself (depersonalization) or your surroundings (derealization).  They can sometimes accompany anxiety and lead to feeling emotionally disconnected.
* **Burnout:**  If you've been under prolonged stress, you may have reached a point of burnout, which can manifest as emotional exhaustion and a sense of detachment.
* **Underlying Depression:** Sometimes, what feels like *just* anxiety is actually anxiety alongside underlying depression. Depression can manifest differently in everyone, and sometimes it shows up as primarily anxiety and numbness rather than sadness.



**2. Why This Might Be Happening (Possible Root Causes)**

* **Chronic Stress/Anxiety:**  This is a big one.  Constant activation of the stress response system can deplete emotional resources.
* **Trauma:** Past trauma (even if you don't consciously think of it as ""traumatic"") can significantly impact emotional regulation and lead to numbing.  This includes emotional neglect in childhood.
* **Medication:** Certain medications (antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, etc.) can have emotional blunting as a side effect. *Do not stop or change your medication without talking to your doctor!*
* **Lifestyle Factors:** Lack of sleep, poor diet, lack of exercise, and social isolation can all contribute to emotional dysregulation.
* **Coping Mechanism:** Numbing can be an unconscious way of coping with overwhelming feelings.  If feeling anything else feels too scary or vulnerable, shutting down can seem like the only option.
* **Neurological Factors:** In some cases, there might be underlying neurological factors that contribute to difficulty processing emotions.



**3. What You Can Do (Strategies to Explore)**

* **Professional Help is Key:**  Seriously. This is the most important point.  See a therapist or psychiatrist.  Here are some types of therapy that could be helpful:
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Helps you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to anxiety.
    * **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):** Focuses on accepting difficult emotions rather than fighting them and committing to values-based action.
    * **Trauma-Informed Therapy (e.g., EMDR, Somatic Experiencing):**  If trauma is a factor, these therapies can help process and heal from traumatic experiences.
    * **Psychodynamic Therapy:** Can explore deeper, underlying patterns and unresolved conflicts that may be contributing to your emotional state.
* **Grounding Techniques:**  These can help you reconnect with the present moment and your body. Examples:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Method:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can calm the nervous system.  Try box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4).
    * **Body Scan:**  Pay attention to sensations in your body, starting with your toes and working your way up.
* **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  Regular practice can increase your awareness of your thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations. Start with guided meditations (apps like Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer are helpful).
* **Gentle Movement:**",0.4434473514556885,2.3050346167218042e-155,0.06593406593406594,0.13281569268492033
"Sometimes, I'm fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth. I've always thought it was normal and I was just nervous, but the other day, it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter Target by myself.","I would suggest keeping a log of those days when you are having a hard time. Items to write would be what were you doing before you felt this way, did you eat and what, what time of day is it, how much sleep did you get that night, etc... This can help you identify any triggers. Further assessment can be made by a health care professional. It does sound like you are experiencing some symptoms of anxiety.","Okay, that sounds *really* tough, and it's good you're starting to question if it's ""just nervousness."" The fact that it's getting to the point where it's significantly impacting your daily life – like being unable to go into a Target for 30 minutes – definitely suggests it's worth looking into further. It's completely valid to feel like something isn't quite right, and you're right to explore that.

Here's a breakdown of what you're describing, what it *could* be, and what steps you could consider.  I'm not a medical professional, so this isn't a diagnosis, just information to help you understand and potentially advocate for yourself.

**What you're describing sounds a lot like anxiety, potentially with a social component.**

Let's break down the symptoms:

* **Fluctuating Symptoms:**  Having good days and bad days is *very* common with anxiety. It's not always constant.  Triggers can vary, and sometimes it just seems to come and go.
* **Physical Symptoms (Racing Heart):** This is a classic physiological response to anxiety.  Your body goes into ""fight or flight"" mode, even when there's no actual physical danger.
* **Difficulty Speaking:**  This can be due to several things within anxiety:
    * **Performance Anxiety:**  Worrying about *how* you're coming across.
    * **Fear of Judgment:**  Being afraid of what others will think.
    * **Physiological Block:** The anxiety itself physically constricts your ability to form words.  It's like your brain is overloaded.
* **Avoidance (Target Example):**  This is a key indicator.  Avoiding situations because of fear and anxiety isn't just shyness; it's a coping mechanism that can actually *reinforce* the anxiety in the long run.  The 30 minutes in the car is a powerful example of how debilitating this is becoming.



**Possible things this could be (again, not a diagnosis - see a professional for that):**

* **Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia):**  This is characterized by intense fear of social situations, worry about being judged or embarrassed, and avoidance of those situations. Your description fits many of the criteria.
* **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):**  This involves persistent, excessive worry about many different things. While you haven't described a lot of *what* you're worrying about, the physical symptoms and avoidance could stem from underlying GAD.
* **Panic Disorder:**  While you haven’t explicitly mentioned *panic attacks* (sudden, overwhelming fear with intense physical symptoms), the racing heart and inability to speak could be precursors to one, or a milder form of panic.
* **Specific Phobia:** Perhaps there’s something about being in stores, or being alone in public, that triggers the anxiety.
* **Other underlying medical conditions:**  It's *always* good to rule out any medical reasons for physical symptoms like a racing heart.  (See ""Next Steps"" below).



**What can you do?  (Next Steps)**

1. **Talk to a Doctor (Primary Care Physician):**  *This is the most important step.*  Explain what you're experiencing. They can:
    * **Rule out medical causes:**  Things like thyroid problems, heart conditions, or other medical issues can sometimes mimic anxiety symptoms.
    * **Refer you to a Mental Health Professional:** This could be a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist.

2. **Consider Therapy:**  Therapy can be incredibly helpful for anxiety.  Common and effective approaches include:
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Helps you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.  It's very practical and often focuses on facing your fears gradually.
    * **Exposure Therapy:**  A type of CBT specifically for phobias and anxiety, where you gradually expose yourself to the feared situation in a safe and controlled environment.  (This is what could help with the Target situation!)
    * **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):**  Focuses on accepting anxious thoughts and feelings rather than fighting them, and committing to values-based actions.

3. **Self-Help Strategies (These are helpful *in addition to* professional help, not as a replacement):**
    * **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  Can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without judgment.
    * **Deep Breathing Exercises:**  Can help calm your nervous system when you're feeling anxious.  (Look up ""diaphragmatic breathing"" or ""box breathing"").
    * **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them.
    * **Regular Exercise:**  A great stress reliever.",0.476303368806839,3.9606363895644325e-79,0.0735873850197109,0.23012421922787807
"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","It is challenging to see one's parents age and to cope with the new demands.  Your mom means a lot to you, and that is why you get easily frustrated.  I'm guessing that it is not that she is making you do work or that her expectations are non-important to you because if that were the case, you would not feel any guilt.  Accepting the new stage will help you cope with the changes.  Take a deep breath every time you feel frustrated and think of the good times you shared with your mom before her getting Alzheimer's.  Remember that your mom as she was is no longer and that she has reverted to a more delicate phase.  Also, schedule time for yourself and do things that help you relax.  Caretaking of an elderly parent can take a toll on you, and it is essential to incorporate self-care.  Finally, look for an Alzheimer's support group in your area that will help you connect with other people going through the same thing.  You are a good daughter, and your mom is lucky to have you in her life.Sincerely, Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling","Okay, this is *incredibly* common. You are absolutely not alone in feeling this way. It's a heartbreaking situation, and the emotional rollercoaster of frustration, anger, guilt, and grief is exhausting.  It's wonderful that you recognize the disconnect between her behavior and her true self, and that you're seeking ways to cope. Here's a breakdown of how to navigate these feelings, broken down into understanding, coping strategies, and self-care.  It's a long answer, because this is a complex issue, but I'll try to be thorough.

**1. Understanding What's Happening in Her Brain**

* **The Disease, Not Her:**  You are right to feel guilty, but you need to *constantly* remind yourself that Alzheimer's is physically changing her brain. The ""her"" you know is fading. The nasty, demanding behavior is a *symptom* of the disease, not a reflection of her personality or her feelings towards you.  Specific areas of the brain impacted by Alzheimer’s can lead to:
    * **Disinhibition:** Loss of social filters. This is why she might say things she *never* would have before, be rude, or act impulsively.
    * **Frustration & Anxiety:** She's likely deeply confused and scared, even if she can't articulate it.  This manifests as irritability and anger.
    * **Loss of Logic & Reasoning:**  The requests for unrealistic items stem from a breakdown in her ability to think rationally. She might be stuck in a past memory or experiencing a distorted reality.
    * **Difficulty Communicating:**  She may not be able to find the right words, understand what you're saying, or express her needs appropriately. This can be incredibly frustrating for *both* of you.
* **It's Not Personal:** This is the hardest part to internalize, but vital.  Her behavior isn't *about* you, even when it feels directed at you. It's about what's happening inside her brain.



**2. Coping Strategies in the Moment**

These are things to try *when* she's being difficult.  They won’t work every time, but they can help de-escalate situations:

* **Validation, Not Correction:**  Instead of saying ""That doesn't make sense,"" or ""Mom, Dad has been gone for 20 years,"" try validating her *feelings*.  For example:
    * **Her:** ""I need to go home!""
    * **You (instead of ""You ARE home!""):**  ""You're feeling anxious about being here, aren't you? It sounds scary to feel lost."" Then, gently redirect: ""Let's sit down and look at some family pictures. That might make you feel more comfortable.""
    * **Her:** ""Where's my purse? I need to go to the store!""
    * **You (instead of ""You don't need to go anywhere!""):**  ""You're wanting to feel independent and take care of things, that's good.  Let’s look at some magazines like you used to when you went shopping.”
* **Redirection:**  This is your most powerful tool.  Change the subject, offer a snack, suggest an activity (listening to music, looking at photos, gentle exercise, a simple puzzle).  Think of it as gently steering her away from the source of distress.
* **Distraction:** Similar to redirection, but more immediate. If she's fixated on something impossible, try a sudden, pleasant distraction: ""Oh, look at that bird outside the window!"" or ""I just made a cup of tea, would you like one?""
* **Simplify Your Responses:** Short, clear sentences. Avoid complex explanations or arguments.
* **Non-Verbal Communication:**  Your tone of voice and body language are crucial. Speak calmly and gently. Maintain eye contact (if she tolerates it).  A gentle touch can sometimes be reassuring.
* **Don't Argue or Try to Reason:**  It's pointless and will only escalate the situation.  Her brain isn't capable of logical reasoning in that moment.
* **Acceptance (of the moment):**  This is incredibly hard, but try to accept that *this is the disease talking*.  You don't have to like it, but accepting it can help you stay calmer.
* **The ""Therapeutic Lie"":**  This is controversial, but often helpful.  Sometimes a gentle, harmless untruth can ease her anxiety.  (e.g., ""Your mother is doing well,"" even if her mother passed away years ago.)  Use this sparingly and with compassion.

**3.  Dealing with Your Own Emotions (This is the Most Important Part)**

* **Acknowledge",0.5235975980758667,3.2528931355573303e-155,0.13048368953880765,0.2870409455466441
Why am I attracted to older men?,"What a wonderful question!Good for you on clearly knowing your priorities.If I was sitting with you now, I'd ask you to list your reasons.Start with whatever answers you do come up with and examine each of these a little further.If, for example, you feel you need a man because many of your friends are in relationships, then possibly you feel insecure about being your unique self, even when this sets you apart from your friends.If, you feel you need a man to protect you financially, then possibly you've lost faith in your ability to financially support yourself.If you'd like a man in your life to offer your love and are willing to contribute the work of relating intimately, then you've found the best reason for wanting a man in your life.This is far different than ""need"".","Okay, let's explore the reasons why you might be attracted to older men. It's a really common preference, and there's a *lot* of potential psychology behind it. It's rarely just one thing! Here's a breakdown of factors, broken down into categories, from evolutionary to personal experience.  I'll try to be thorough, but remember this is general information, and *your* specific reasons are unique to you.  I'll also add a disclaimer at the end.

**1. Evolutionary & Biological Factors (These are often subconscious):**

*   **Resource Provisioning:** Historically (and often still today), older men tend to have more established careers, financial stability, and resources.  From an evolutionary perspective, this could be attractive as it signals the ability to provide and protect for offspring (even if you don't consciously want children).  This isn't about *you* wanting a ""sugar daddy,"" but a deeply ingrained association.
*   **Status & Confidence:**  Age often (though not always) comes with increased status, experience, and self-assuredness. These qualities can be very attractive. Confidence is often perceived as a desirable trait.
*   **Maturity & Emotional Stability:**  Older men are, generally speaking, more emotionally mature than younger men.  They may have a better understanding of themselves, be more comfortable with vulnerability (though not always!), and be less prone to the ""drama"" sometimes associated with younger relationships.
*   **Experience (Sexual & Life):**  Older men often have more experience in relationships and intimacy, which can be appealing. This isn’t just about sexual expertise, but also a perceived ability to understand and satisfy a partner.
* **Hormonal Factors:** While research is ongoing, some theories suggest that hormonal preferences can play a role. For example, some studies suggest women are attracted to pheromones that indicate genetic compatibility, and these might be more prevalent in older men. (This is a complex area, and not fully understood.)

**2. Psychological & Emotional Factors (These are more conscious and related to your upbringing/personality):**

*   **Father Figure/Authority:**  This is a big one for many people.  If your relationship with your father was particularly strong (positive or negative), you might unconsciously seek out similar traits in partners.
    *   **Positive Father Figure:**  You might be drawn to men who embody the positive qualities of your father – kindness, protectiveness, wisdom.
    *   **Absent or Difficult Father:**  You might be trying to ""fix"" a past dynamic by seeking a partner who can provide the nurturing or guidance you lacked. (This is often subconscious and can lead to unhealthy patterns if not addressed).
*   **Need for Guidance & Security:** If you feel insecure or unsure of yourself, an older man might represent a source of stability, guidance, and support.
*   **Intellectual Connection:**  Older men may have more life experience and a broader range of interests, leading to more stimulating conversations and intellectual connection.
*   **Desire for a Different Dynamic:**  Perhaps you're tired of the dating patterns or immaturity you've experienced with men your own age.  You might actively *prefer* a relationship with someone who is more established and focused.
*   **Feeling Underestimated/Desire to be Seen:** Some individuals feel that older men appreciate them for who they are, beyond superficial qualities, and see their intelligence and depth.
*   **Rebellion/Breaking Societal Norms:** Sometimes, attraction to older men can be a way of rebelling against societal expectations or defying norms.
* **Past Relationship Patterns:** You may have had positive experiences with older men in the past, shaping your preferences.

**3. Personal Experiences & Individual Preferences:**

*   **Early Experiences:**  The first men you were exposed to (family friends, mentors, etc.) may have been older, and this could have shaped your initial attraction.
*   **Personality Compatibility:**  You simply might find that your personality is more compatible with older men.  Perhaps you share similar values, interests, or a similar sense of humor.
*   **Life Stage Alignment:**  Older men might be at a similar life stage to you (e.g., established in their careers, looking for a serious relationship), while men your own age might be focused on different things.
* **Personal Taste:** Sometimes, it's simply a matter of personal preference! You might just *like* the aesthetic, the energy, or the vibe that older men tend to have.



**Important Considerations & Things to Reflect On:**

*   **Age Gaps and Power Dynamics:** Be mindful of potential power imbalances, especially with significant age differences. Ensure the relationship is equitable and healthy.  A large age gap can sometimes (not always) create an uneven playing field.
*   **Social Stigma:**",0.511985719203949,4.142360503234249e-79,0.09896432681242809,0.25212740062341293
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",You can be helped. Many of the people I see have multiple issues. These issues are often linked so that helping one issue will positively help the other issues.,"Okay, that is a *lot* to carry, and it's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge it all and consider counseling. You are absolutely not alone in having multiple, complex issues, and **you absolutely do NOT have too many issues to address in counseling.** That's a really common misconception. In fact, it's *more* common to present with multiple intertwined concerns than just one.

Here's a breakdown of why your concerns are absolutely workable in therapy, and how a therapist might approach it.  I'll also give you some things to think about when choosing a therapist.

**Why it's okay (and good!) to address everything:**

* **Everything is Connected:**  These experiences aren't isolated. The sexual abuse, the cancer experience, the insomnia, the depression, the anxiety, and even the low self-esteem – they all likely impact each other. Trauma can contribute to depression and anxiety. Cancer and its treatment can be profoundly traumatic and affect self-image. Insomnia exacerbates everything.  A good therapist will understand this interconnectedness.
* **Therapy Isn't About ""Fixing"" Everything at Once:**  It's a process. You don't walk in and get ""cured.""  Therapy is about exploring, understanding, developing coping mechanisms, and building resilience.  You and your therapist will work *together* to prioritize what feels most pressing *to you* at any given time.
* **Untreated Trauma Underlies So Much:** Often, unresolved trauma (like sexual abuse) can be a root cause of many other issues, including depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Addressing the trauma doesn't magically erase everything else, but it can create a foundation for healing in other areas.
* **Your Marriage is a Strength:** The fact that you've maintained a happy marriage for 35 years is *significant*. It demonstrates resilience, commitment, and likely some existing coping skills.  This is a huge asset.  Therapy can even help you navigate how your individual experiences impact your relationship (and how your relationship can *support* your healing).



**How a Therapist Might Approach This (Generally):**

1. **Building Trust & Safety:** The first few sessions will likely focus on establishing a safe and trusting relationship with the therapist.  You'll want to find someone you feel comfortable with.
2. **Assessment:** The therapist will carefully assess your history, symptoms, and goals for therapy.  This will involve asking a lot of questions. Be honest, even if it's difficult.
3. **Prioritization (Collaboratively):**  You and the therapist will discuss what feels most urgent.  Maybe it's the anxiety that's currently interfering with your daily life. Maybe it's the unresolved trauma. Maybe it's the insomnia. You get to have a say in this.
4. **Phased Approach:**  Often, therapy will unfold in phases:
    * **Stabilization:**  Learning coping skills for managing anxiety, insomnia, and depression *right now*.  This might include relaxation techniques, mindfulness, sleep hygiene strategies, and cognitive behavioral techniques.
    * **Trauma Processing (if you choose):**  If you decide you want to address the sexual abuse, this will be done carefully and at your pace. There are various trauma-informed therapies (see below).  *You are in control of whether and when you delve into this.*
    * **Addressing Self-Esteem & Other Issues:**  As you process trauma and develop coping skills, you can start to address the underlying issues contributing to low self-esteem.
5. **Ongoing Evaluation:** The therapist will regularly check in with you to see how therapy is going and make adjustments as needed.



**Types of Therapy That Might Be Helpful (Discuss with a Therapist):**

* **Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT):**  Specifically designed for trauma survivors.
* **Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR):** Another effective trauma therapy.
* **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Helps identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors (good for anxiety, depression, and insomnia).
* **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):**  Focuses on accepting difficult thoughts and feelings and committing to values-based actions.
* **Mindfulness-Based Therapy:**  Helps you become more aware of the present moment without judgment.
* **Psychodynamic Therapy:** Explores how past experiences shape current patterns of thinking and behavior.
* **Somatic Experiencing:** A body-oriented approach to trauma healing.



**Finding the Right Therapist:**

* **Look for Specialization:**  Specifically, look for therapists who have experience with:
    * **Trauma:**  *Essential* given your history.
    * **Cancer Survivorship:**  Understanding the unique emotional challenges of cancer is helpful.",0.4553539752960205,1.5781684373006338e-155,0.035862068965517246,0.1416122004357299
"I'm scared that I am with this man so I won't be alone. He should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case, and I don’t want to hurt him.","While not wanting to be alone may not be the best reason to be in a relationship, it is probably more common and normal a reason than you think.  Since you seem to care about your friend (""don't want to hurt him""), I imagine there are many other reasons that you are together.  I suggest that you talk about this open-heartedly with each other.  The idea of being afraid of being alone sounds like an honest starting place.  Don't try to ""figure out"" whether you should be with him.  Just talk.  The communication is likely to shine light on deepening connection for BOTH OF YOU.In the meantime, your idea that you don't deserve him is rooted in a ""core lie"" that you are telling yourself.  You can read about ""core lies"" and much more in my book, Living Yes, a Handbook for Being Human.  Check out www.LivingYes.org.Be easy on yourself.  You are deserving!~Mark","Okay, this is a really brave thing to admit, both to yourself and to even put into words. It takes a lot of self-awareness to recognize that you might be staying with someone out of fear of loneliness, and it's incredibly considerate of you to be worried about hurting him. Let's break this down, and I'll try to offer some helpful thoughts.  This is a complex situation, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed.  I'll try to be thorough.

**First: Validating Your Feelings**

* **It's incredibly common.**  The fear of being alone is a *very* powerful human emotion.  Our brains are wired for connection, and the thought of facing life solo can be terrifying.  You are absolutely not alone in feeling this way.
* **Recognizing it is the first step.** You've already done the hardest part – you've identified a potential underlying reason for staying in the relationship that isn't based on strong, fulfilling love.  That's huge.
* **It's okay to not ""deserve"" someone in the way you think.** This idea that someone *should* be with someone who ""deserves"" them is a tricky one.  Everyone deserves to be happy, yes, but ""deserving"" doesn't have a checklist.  It's not about being ""worthy"" of love; it's about finding a connection that feels right *for both people*.  You're putting a lot of pressure on yourself with this thought.



**Let's unpack the core issues:**

1. **Fear of Loneliness:** This is the primary driver you've identified.  Explore this.
   * **What specifically scares you about being alone?**  Is it the practical aspects (managing finances, household tasks)? Is it the emotional aspect (no one to share your life with, feeling isolated)? Is it societal pressure?  Knowing the *specifics* of your fear makes it easier to address.
   * **Have you been happy *with* him, or just relieved to not be alone?** This is a crucial question.  Think back over the relationship.  Are there moments of genuine joy, connection, and shared growth? Or has it mostly been...comfortable?
   * **What does your life look like *outside* of the relationship?** Do you have hobbies, friends, family, interests that you enjoy?  A fulfilling life *outside* of a relationship makes being alone much less scary.

2. **Concern for His Happiness:** You don't want to hurt him, and you believe he deserves someone who feels strongly for him. This is very empathetic of you.
   * **Staying with someone out of guilt is not fair to either of you.**  It's actually *more* harmful in the long run. He deserves to be with someone who chooses him wholeheartedly.  You deserve to be with someone you feel strongly about.
   * **He may already sense something is off.**  People are often more perceptive than we think.  Staying because you feel bad might be prolonging the inevitable and creating more pain down the road.
   * **His happiness is not your responsibility.**  You can care about him and want good things for him *even if* you aren't the one to provide them.



**What can you do? (This is where it gets practical)**

* **Self-Reflection (Highly Recommended):**  Spend some time journaling, meditating, or just quietly thinking about these questions.  Really dig deep.  Be honest with yourself, even if it's uncomfortable.
* **Talk to a Trusted Friend/Family Member:**  Someone who will listen without judgment and offer honest feedback.  Choose someone who knows both of you, but whose primary loyalty is to *you*.
* **Consider Therapy:**  A therapist can provide a safe, neutral space to explore your feelings, understand your patterns, and develop healthy coping mechanisms for dealing with the fear of loneliness.  They can also help you navigate the potential breakup with compassion and clarity. (I'll put some resources at the end).
* **If You Decide to End Things:**
    * **Be Honest (but Kind):**  You don't need to go into a long, drawn-out explanation.  Something like, ""I've realized that I'm not able to give you the kind of relationship you deserve, and I need to be honest about that.  This isn't a reflection of you, but a realization about what I need.""
    * **Avoid Blame:**  Don't make it about his flaws. Focus on your own feelings and needs.
    * **Be Firm:**  Once you've made the decision, stick to it.  Don't let guilt or his pleas sway you.
    * **Allow Him to React:**  He'll likely be hurt",0.5496615767478943,0.01794082343121747,0.12107623318385652,0.2902757619738752
"I've known him for about six years. We've dated off and on. I hadn't seen him in close to three years but recently started seeing him again. I really want this to last this time. I stayed the night. Do I text, call, or make contact first, the same day of the morning I left his house?","It is possible your question reflects some insecurity about whether or not either or you would like this relationship to continue.Otherwise, the answer to your question would appear naturally.  If you genuinely feel close enough to this person to sleep with him, then who texts whom first, wouldn't really matter too much.Try to understand within yourself whether you feel truly interested in this person as much as you would like to feel toward someone.","Okay, this is a classic post-sleepover question! It's great you want this to last, and being thoughtful about initial contact is a good sign. Here's a breakdown of what to do, leaning towards what's most likely to build connection and avoid misinterpretation, considering the ""off and on"" history, and the desire for something lasting *this* time.

**My Recommendation: A Text - Later in the Day, Not First Thing**

Here's the reasoning, broken down, and then a few text examples:

* **Why *not* call right away:** Calling can feel a bit much this soon, especially given the on-again, off-again nature of the relationship. It can read as needing a lot of reassurance, or even a bit clingy (even if you don't *feel* that way!).  You want to establish a comfortable, independent vibe, especially as you rebuild.
* **Why *not* text *immediately* after leaving:**  Leaving immediately and then texting immediately can feel a little...transactional. It can imply the connection was primarily physical and that you're checking in to see if *you* were okay in his mind, rather than genuinely wanting to connect. A little space is good. Let him have a bit of his morning and process too.
* **Why a text is good:** It's low-pressure. It shows you're thinking of him, but doesn't demand an immediate response. It allows him to respond when *he's* ready, which is important.
* **Timing - Later in the Day:**  This is key. Aim for late afternoon or early evening. This shows you're not obsessing, but you *are* interested. Think: ""After he's likely had a normal day.""  (e.g., if he works 9-5, after 5:30-6pm is good).

**What to Say in the Text (Examples - choose the one that best fits *your* personality and your dynamic):**

**Option 1:  Light & Appreciative (Good all-around choice)**

> ""Hey! Had a really great time last night. Hope you have a good day. 😊""

**Why it works:** Simple, positive, and expresses enjoyment without being overly effusive.  The emoji adds a friendly touch.

**Option 2:  Slightly More Engaging (If you want to prompt a bit more conversation)**

> ""Morning! Just thinking about [mention something specific you talked about or enjoyed last night - a funny story, a shared interest]. Hope your day is going well.""

**Why it works:** Shows you were present and listening, and gives him an easy opening to respond about that specific topic.

**Option 3:  Playful & Flirty (If that's your style)**

> ""Hope you woke up okay after my amazing company last night 😉.  Seriously though, had a lot of fun!""

**Why it works:** Playful and confident, but still acknowledges you enjoyed yourself.  Use this *only* if flirting is natural in your relationship.

**Option 4: Minimalist (If you both tend to be less expressive)**

> ""Hey, just wanted to say I enjoyed last night.""

**Important Do's and Don'ts:**

* **DO:** Keep it relatively short and sweet.
* **DO:** Be genuine.
* **DO:** Use your normal texting style. Don't try to be someone you're not.
* **DON'T:** Ask a million questions. (e.g., ""Did you have a good time?"" - you already implied that.)
* **DON'T:** Over-analyze his response (or lack thereof) immediately. Give him time to reply.
* **DON'T:**  Bring up the past or future of the relationship in this first text.  Focus on the positive experience *you just had*.
* **DON'T:** Send multiple texts if he doesn't respond right away.



**What if he *doesn't* text back?**

This is the tricky part. Give it a full 24 hours before you start to worry.  People get busy.  If you haven't heard anything after 24 hours, *then* you could send a very casual follow-up, like:

> ""No worries if you're swamped, just checking in. Hope you're having a good week!""

If he *still* doesn't respond after that, it's a sign he might not be as interested in pursuing things right now.  It's painful, but it's better to know sooner rather than later.  



**To help me tailor the advice even more, could you tell me:**

* **What's your general texting style like with him",0.4664495587348938,2.2971409728613647e-155,0.07040417209908736,0.23010208337953333
"I keep having these random thoughts that I don't want. Things like ""you aren't worth anything."" I know they're my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it.
   What is wrong with me, and how can I stop having these thoughts?","Many people have thoughts like those you describe, and often it feels like someone else is saying it because they are things that may have been said to you when you were very young.  When young children hear negative things about themselves they tend to internalize these negative ideas and to form negative core beliefs.  The good news is we can learn to stop these thoughts and to replace them with healthier thoughts.  The first step is to catch yourself when you are thinking these thoughts, and to stay ""stop!""; then replace it with another thought.  So for instance, maybe you fail a test or get rejected by a romantic interest.  You catch yourself saying ""you aren't worth anything"". Stop this thought, and replace it with ""You didn't do as well on that test as you would have liked.  Let's figure out how you can do better next time.""  Or ""she may not want to go out with you, but someone else will"". So the idea is to develop a voice of a ""friend"", who can tell you the kind of things you would say to your own best friend.  You might also pick up the book, Feeling Good, by David Burns. He gives many tips for how to change Negative Self Talk.","Okay, this is a really common and distressing experience, and you're very brave for acknowledging it and reaching out. It's good you recognize these thoughts *as* thoughts, even if they feel imposed. That's a really important first step. Let's break down what might be happening and how you can start to address it.  I'm going to give a fairly comprehensive answer, but please read the disclaimer at the end.

**What's Going On? (Possible Explanations)**

There are several things that could be contributing to these unwanted, negative thoughts.  It's rarely just ""something being wrong with you."" Here are some possibilities:

* **Intrusive Thoughts:** This is the most likely explanation. Intrusive thoughts are unwanted, involuntary thoughts, images, or urges that pop into your mind. They can be disturbing, distressing, and feel completely out of character.  The key thing is *you don't want them, and they cause you distress*.  They are often ego-dystonic, meaning they conflict with your values and beliefs.  They often feel ""alien"" or like they're coming from somewhere else, which is why you describe it as feeling like someone else is saying them.  Everyone experiences intrusive thoughts to some degree, but when they become frequent and distressing, they can be a sign of something else (see below).
* **Anxiety:** Anxiety is a huge driver of negative self-talk.  When you're anxious, your brain goes into threat-detection mode, and sometimes that threat gets misdirected inward.  You might be hyper-critical of yourself as a way to try to ""control"" things or avoid perceived failures.
* **Depression:**  Depression often comes with a harsh inner critic and feelings of worthlessness.  While intrusive thoughts can happen with *just* anxiety, depression often makes them stick around longer and feel more believable.
* **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):**  OCD involves intrusive thoughts (obsessions) followed by repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) aimed at reducing the anxiety caused by the thoughts.  The content of the obsessions varies widely.  While the ""you aren't worth anything"" thought isn't a classic OCD obsession (they're often about contamination, safety, or morality), it *could* be part of a broader OCD pattern.
* **Low Self-Esteem/Negative Core Beliefs:** If you've had a history of criticism, trauma, or negative experiences, you might have developed deeply ingrained negative beliefs about yourself. These beliefs can surface as these intrusive thoughts.
* **Trauma:** Past trauma can significantly impact self-worth and lead to intrusive thoughts related to feelings of shame, guilt, or inadequacy.
* **Stress:**  High levels of stress can exacerbate any of the above issues.  When you're overwhelmed, your coping mechanisms can become less effective.



**How to Stop (or at least Manage) These Thoughts:**

Here's a breakdown of strategies, starting with things you can do *right now* and moving into longer-term approaches.

**1. Immediate Techniques (When a thought hits):**

* **Label it as an Intrusive Thought:**  Mentally say to yourself, ""This is just an intrusive thought."" Recognizing it *as* an intrusive thought, rather than a truth, is HUGE.  This creates distance.
* **Don't Engage:** This is the hardest part.  *Do not* argue with the thought, analyze it, or try to push it away forcefully.  Trying to suppress a thought often makes it stronger (this is called the ""ironic process theory"").  Instead...
* **Thought Defusion:**  Techniques to create distance from the thought:
    * **Say it in a silly voice:**  Seriously.  Make it sound ridiculous.
    * **Repeat it quickly:**  Say the thought over and over again, very fast, until it loses its meaning. (""You aren't worth anything, you aren't worth anything, you aren't worth anything..."")
    * **Thank your brain:**  Sounds weird, but it acknowledges the thought without giving it power.  ""Thank you, brain, for sharing that thought.""
* **Grounding Techniques:**  Bring yourself back to the present moment:
    * **5-4-3-2-1:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system. (Box breathing is good: inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4).
    * **Focus on Physical Sensations:**  Feel your feet on the ground, the chair",0.5475074052810669,0.02284794406803661,0.13129102844638948,0.3250196813118569
"I'm a guy. If I don't like girls, nor do I like guys, does that mean I'm gay?","Hi, and thanks for your question. I agree with my colleagues about researching asexuality, but I want too add a couple of things about that:Here is a website that you can start with to get some information about asexuality - http://www.asexuality.org/home/There are a whole lot of myths surrounding asexuality. One is that people who are asexual have absolutely no interest in sex, and that is not always the case. There are variations of asexuality. Some people who are asexual have an interest in sex and others don't. Also, once you read more on this topic, you may find that you don't connect with asexuality either, and that is okay. Our society usually thinks of sexual orientations as only being straight, gay, lesbian, or bisexual, but the truth is there are many variations of sexual orientations. Keep exploring. There is a good chance that there is a community of people who feel like you do. Finally, labels are important for a lot of things, but labeling ourselves can sometimes lead to some painful feelings. Try not to feel pressured to label yourself too quickly. This is your journey. Your experience. Take all the time you need. You may never feel the need to label how you feel, and that is okay, too. Hope this helps. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC  ","Okay, let's break this down. It's great you're asking this question and exploring your feelings. The simple answer is **no, not liking girls *or* guys doesn't automatically mean you're gay.**

Here's a more detailed explanation, covering different possibilities:

* **Asexual:** This is the most likely possibility. Asexuality is a sexual orientation characterized by a lack of sexual attraction to anyone. Asexual people don't experience sexual desire, or experience it very rarely.  It's *not* the same as celibacy (choosing not to have sex) or a lack of romantic attraction.  You can be asexual and still have romantic feelings for people.

* **Aromantic:** This describes a lack of *romantic* attraction. You might enjoy friendships and close bonds with people, but you don't experience romantic feelings like wanting a romantic relationship, feeling ""butterflies,"" or wanting a partner in that way.  Someone can be both asexual *and* aromantic (often called ""aroace"").

* **Demisexual:**  Demisexual people *do* experience sexual attraction, but only after forming a strong emotional connection with someone. It's not a matter of not being attracted to anyone, but needing that deep connection *first*.

* **Graysexual/Grayromantic:** These fall on a spectrum. Graysexual people experience sexual attraction very rarely, or with low intensity. Grayromantic people experience romantic attraction rarely or with low intensity.

* **It's possible you haven't found anyone you're attracted to yet:**  Attraction can be complex and can develop over time. It's okay if you haven't experienced it yet.

* **You might be questioning:** It's perfectly fine to not have a label right now.  You're figuring things out, and that's a journey.



**Why it's *not* automatically gay:**

* **Gay** specifically means attraction to people of the *same* gender. If you're not attracted to either gender, that doesn't fit the definition.
* **Straight** means attraction to the *opposite* gender.  Again, not fitting this definition doesn't mean you're the opposite.
* **Bisexual** means attraction to *both* genders.  This doesn't apply if you feel no attraction to either.



**What to do next:**

* **Research:**  Look into the terms I've mentioned (asexual, aromantic, demisexual, graysexual/romantic).  There are lots of great resources online.  (See ""Resources"" below).
* **Don't feel pressured to label yourself:** It's okay to just *be* and explore your feelings without needing a specific label.
* **Talk to someone (if you want to):**  A trusted friend, family member, counselor, or therapist can provide support and a safe space to discuss your feelings.  There are also online communities (see resources below) where you can connect with others who are going through similar experiences.
* **Be patient with yourself:**  Figuring out your identity takes time and self-reflection.



**Resources:**

* **The Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN):** [https://www.asexuality.org/](https://www.asexuality.org/) - This is *the* go-to resource for information about asexuality.
* **The Trevor Project:** [https://www.thetrevorproject.org/](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/) -  A crisis intervention and suicide prevention organization for LGBTQ young people. (Even if you don't identify as LGBTQ, they can offer support.)

"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years. I have been on medication, but lately my depression has felt worse. Can counseling help?","Thank you for asking this important question. I find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment. Step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change. Congratulations you did the first step! You are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question. Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression. The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with  Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events. Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression.  The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment. As counselors, we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time. However, remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well being. I hope this was helpful, and good luck with your treatment journey. ","Okay, it's really good that you're recognizing your depression is worsening, and it's smart to ask about adding counseling, especially when medication isn't feeling fully effective right now.  The short answer is **yes, counseling can absolutely help, often *especially* when combined with medication.** Here's a more detailed breakdown of how, why, and what to expect:

**Why Counseling Can Help When Medication Isn't Enough**

* **Medication addresses symptoms, counseling addresses causes:**  Medication often works by balancing brain chemistry, which can significantly reduce *symptoms* like sadness, worry, and sleep problems.  Counseling (also called therapy) dives deeper to explore the *underlying causes* of your depression and anxiety.  This might include past experiences, relationship patterns, negative thought patterns, coping mechanisms (or lack thereof), and current life stressors.  Addressing these root causes can lead to more lasting change.
* **Developing Coping Skills:** Counseling equips you with practical skills to manage difficult emotions, challenging situations, and triggers.  These skills can include:
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques:**  Identifying and changing negative thought patterns.
    * **Mindfulness and Relaxation techniques:**  Reducing anxiety and increasing present-moment awareness.
    * **Interpersonal skills:** Improving communication and relationships.
    * **Problem-solving skills:**  Finding effective ways to deal with life's challenges.
* **Personalized Support & Exploration:** A therapist provides a safe, non-judgmental space for you to explore your feelings, thoughts, and experiences.  They can offer a different perspective and help you understand yourself better.  This can be incredibly validating and empowering.
* **Addressing Specific Issues:**  Sometimes depression and anxiety are linked to specific issues (grief, trauma, relationship problems, career stress). Counseling can focus on these specific areas.
* **Medication Management Support:** A good therapist won't interfere with your medication (they'll likely want you to continue working with your prescribing doctor), but they *can* help you explore how you feel *on* the medication, identify any side effects that are bothering you, and help you communicate effectively with your doctor about any adjustments.



**Types of Counseling That are Often Effective for Depression & Anxiety**

* **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Very popular and well-researched. Focuses on the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.  Helps you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.
* **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):**  Often used for people with intense emotional experiences.  Focuses on mindfulness, emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness.
* **Psychodynamic Therapy:** Explores how past experiences influence present behavior.  Can be a longer-term therapy.
* **Interpersonal Therapy (IPT):** Focuses on improving relationships and social support.
* **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):**  Focuses on accepting difficult thoughts and feelings rather than fighting them, and committing to values-based actions.
* **Humanistic Therapy (Person-Centered):**  Emphasizes empathy, unconditional positive regard, and helping you reach your full potential.



**What to Expect in Counseling**

* **Initial Session(s):**  Often involve the therapist asking about your history, your current symptoms, your goals for therapy, and what you're hoping to get out of it.  It's a chance for you to get a feel for the therapist and see if it's a good fit.
* **Regular Sessions:**  Typically 50-60 minutes long, usually weekly or bi-weekly.
* **Confidentiality:**  Therapists are legally and ethically bound to maintain confidentiality (with a few exceptions, like if you report harming yourself or others).
* **Active Participation:**  Counseling is *not* passive. You'll be expected to actively participate, share your thoughts and feelings, and work on assignments between sessions.
* **It Takes Time:**  It's important to be patient.  It usually takes several sessions to start seeing significant improvement.  



**How to Find a Counselor**

* **Your Doctor:**  Your primary care physician or psychiatrist can often provide referrals.
* **Insurance Company:**  Your insurance provider can give you a list of in-network therapists.

"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","Thank you for sharing your question.  I imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session.  I would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals.  For example, a list of goals may look similar to this:1.  ""I will learn about the effects of medication on the symptoms of depression and anxiety.""2.  ""I will learn about the factors that affect insomnia.""3.  ""I will learn about resources and support groups in my local area to help me cope with my traumatic experiences.""4.  ""I will practice self-care exercises each day and write about my thoughts and feelings in a journal so I can measure whether or not I""m making progress.""This is an example of some of the possible goals a counselor can help you work toward each week.  Working toward a specific goal can lead to a feeling of accomplishment once you've completed it, and this may have a positive impact on your self-esteem.  I hope this information helps, and I wish you all the best!","Okay, that's a *lot* to carry, and it's incredibly brave of you to even acknowledge it all and consider counseling. Absolutely, unequivocally **no, you do not have too many issues to address in counseling.** That's a very common misconception, and it's understandable why you'd feel that way - it *sounds* overwhelming. But that's exactly what counselors are trained to handle.

Here's a breakdown of why your concerns are valid, why it's *good* you're thinking about counseling, and how it can work, addressing each of your points:

**1. It's Not ""Too Much"" - It's Complex, and That's Okay.**

*   **Interconnectedness:** These issues aren't isolated.  The sexual abuse likely impacts your self-esteem, your anxiety, potentially your depression, and even how you experience your body (especially after breast cancer).  Insomnia often exacerbates depression and anxiety. A good therapist will understand these connections and work with you holistically.
*   **Trauma-Informed Care:**  A skilled therapist will approach everything through a trauma-informed lens, meaning they recognize the impact of trauma (like the sexual abuse) even if you don't immediately bring it up in every session. This is crucial.
*   **Counseling is a Process, Not a Quick Fix:** It's not about ""solving"" everything in a few sessions. It's about a journey of understanding, healing, and developing coping mechanisms.
* **You've functioned well despite this:** The fact that you've maintained a 35-year marriage is a testament to your strength and resilience, even while carrying this burden. Counseling isn't about ""fixing"" something broken; it's about supporting your continued growth and well-being.



**2. Let's Look at Your Specific Issues:**

*   **Sexual Abuse:**  This is a deeply important issue to address.  Untreated trauma can have long-lasting effects on mental health, relationships, and self-perception.  Counseling can help you process the trauma, develop coping skills, and reclaim your sense of safety and agency. *You are not responsible for what happened to you.*
*   **Breast Cancer Survivorship:**  Cancer is a traumatic experience in itself. The physical and emotional toll, the fear of recurrence, and changes to your body image all warrant support.  Counseling can help you navigate these challenges, process grief, and find meaning and hope.
*   **Insomnia:**  Chronic insomnia is often a symptom of underlying issues like anxiety and depression, but it also creates a vicious cycle.  Counseling (often with techniques like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia - CBT-I) can help you identify the causes of your insomnia and develop strategies for better sleep.
*   **Depression:**  A long history of depression means you've likely developed coping mechanisms (some helpful, some not). Counseling can help you understand the patterns of your depression, identify triggers, and learn new, healthier ways to manage your mood.
*   **Anxiety (emerging):**  It's common for anxiety to develop as a result of other experiences, like trauma or a health crisis. Addressing the root causes with therapy can help manage the anxiety.
*   **Low Self-Esteem:**  This is often a core issue that underlies many other problems.  Counseling can help you challenge negative self-beliefs, build self-compassion, and develop a stronger sense of self-worth.
* **Happy Marriage:** This is a huge asset! A therapist can also help you communicate more effectively with your spouse *about* what you're experiencing in therapy (at your own pace, and with your comfort level), strengthening your connection.



**3. How Counseling Might Work (What to Expect):**

*   **Start Slow:** You don't have to spill everything in the first session.  A good therapist will let you set the pace. You might start by talking about what brought you in *now* – what's currently bothering you the most.
*   **Assessment:** The therapist will likely ask a lot of questions to get a comprehensive understanding of your history and current situation.
*   **Goal Setting:** You'll work *with* the therapist to identify what you want to achieve in therapy. What would make your life better?  What changes do you want to see?
*   **Therapeutic Approaches:** There are many different types of therapy. Some that might be particularly helpful for you include:
    *   **Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT):**  For processing the sexual abuse.
    *   **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** For depression, anxiety, and insomnia.
    *   **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):**  For learning to accept difficult thoughts",0.5634137988090515,0.019130183273957675,0.12267250821467689,0.268476797386238
"I broke up with him three weeks ago because I felt that he needed to be more respectful. He has since had a rebound relationship. He says he loves and misses me but refuses to see me. He says it's going to be too difficult to see me. Every time we talk, it feels like I'm being pushy to see him. He used to be so madly in love with me, but now, it seems like he couldn’t care less. I think I'm running him away.","Hi Kansas,I think your first instinct was good; you broke up with him. You deserve respect, but right now you're not acting as if you deserve it when you push to see him as he's moving on with a new relationship. It's appropriate now for you to respect that relationship and listen to what he says he wants, which is space. Do you think he's going to be any different with her? This a common, unfounded fear we have. I wonder if maybe you miss the feeling of being in love and having a partner more than you miss him. The bottom line is you can't make someone love you, and you can't make someone be loving towards you, because how someone treats you (and the choices they make) has everything to do with who they are, and nothing to do with who you are. I hope you gather support from others and move on in hope and strength for your own future.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's incredibly painful. It's completely understandable why you're feeling confused, hurt, and like you're doing something wrong. Let's break this down and try to get some clarity. You're right to recognize you might be contributing to him pulling away further, but it's *not* because you're inherently ""pushy."" It's about the dynamics at play here, and what his behavior is telling you.

Here's a detailed look at what's happening, why you're likely feeling this way, and what you can do:

**Understanding What's Happening:**

* **The Rebound is a Huge Factor:**  He's in a rebound relationship. This *significantly* colors everything. Rebounds are often about avoiding dealing with the pain of the breakup, and creating a distraction.  He's likely using this new relationship (and his claims to you) to avoid facing his own feelings.  The ""love and miss you"" statements could be a way to soothe his own guilt, or to keep you emotionally hooked without having to actually *do* the work of processing the breakup.
* **His ""Too Difficult"" Excuse:** This is a classic deflection.  If someone truly wanted to see you, they would find a way. Saying it's ""too difficult"" is a way to maintain control, avoid uncomfortable conversations, and keep you at a distance *without* taking full responsibility for that distance. It's a softer rejection than a blunt ""I don't want to see you.""
* **The Shift in Behavior:**  The dramatic change in his affections is jarring. It's incredibly painful to feel like someone who once adored you now seems indifferent. This can lead you to question your perception of reality and try harder to ""fix"" things. It's natural to want the old version of him back.
* **Your Feelings are Valid:**  You broke up with him because of a legitimate reason - a lack of respect. You were standing up for your needs. Now, seeing him with someone else, and hearing mixed signals, is reopening those wounds and making you second-guess yourself.  It's okay to feel confused, sad, and to want closure.



**Why You Feel Like You're Running Him Away (and why it's a bit more nuanced):**

You're perceptive to notice you might be pushing him away.  Here's why that feeling is likely arising:

* **Desperation (even unintentional):**  When someone tells you they need space, continuing to reach out, even with good intentions, can come across as desperation.  It reinforces his need for distance.  He might perceive it as you not respecting his boundaries (even if he's the one creating the confusing situation!).
* **Seeking Reassurance:**  You're likely trying to get validation that his feelings for you were real, and that you weren't wrong to break up with him. But he’s not going to give you that reassurance, especially while in a rebound.
* **Chasing a Ghost:** You're trying to connect with the *potential* of what was, not the reality of what *is* now. The ""him"" you miss likely doesn't exist right now. He’s occupied with someone else and processing (or avoiding processing) the breakup.




**What You Need to Do (and it’s hard, but important):**

1. **Complete No Contact (Seriously):** This is the hardest, but most crucial step. Stop all communication. No texts, calls, social media stalking, asking mutual friends about him... *nothing*.  This is not a tactic to ""win him back."" It's about protecting *yourself* and allowing *him* to experience the consequences of his choices.  It allows both of you space to heal (or not) without interference.  This is especially important with the rebound relationship in the mix.  Continuing contact validates the rebound and prevents him from truly dealing with things.
2. **Accept His Actions at Face Value:**  Believe what he *does*, not what he *says*. He says he loves and misses you, but his *actions* are telling you he doesn't want to be with you right now.  His actions are the truth. Stop trying to interpret hidden meanings or hoping he'll change his mind.
3. **Focus on *Your* Healing:**  This is the time to invest in yourself.  Therapy can be incredibly helpful.  Spend time with friends and family.  Rediscover hobbies.  Focus on activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. The stronger and more independent you become, the less power he has over your emotions.
4. **Recognize the Disrespect:** You broke up with him for a reason.  His behavior *now* – the mixed signals, the rebound,",0.5469371676445007,0.012136889221167532,0.12554112554112554,0.3287324752208163
"My dad cheated on my mom for 13 years. I cannot stop obsessing over the fact that my boyfriend might be cheating on me even when I know he isn't. I have full access to his phone, social media, and e-mails. I never find anything, but I'm obsessed with constantly checking just in case. How do I stop this? It's driving a wedge between us.","Hi Greenville, I respect that you're owning your own overreactions, and that you want to give your boyfriend the respect he deserves. The truth is that some people cheat, and some don't, and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they can't be trusted.The answer here is in two different areas. Basically, if you want to feel differently (more trusting, in your case), you look at your thoughts, and your behaviours.Your thoughts are stuck... like tires in deep ruts in the road. These thoughts are only habits, they don't reflect the truth. Fear is probably whispering in your ear things like ""everyone cheats"", or "" you're not enough for him"". Once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you, picture those words in red next time they come up. Ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought (there won't be much...perhaps none), and what is the evidence that doesn't support it (I know lots of good men, I know I deserve love and loyalty, there is no sign of infidelity...). You're learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear. That's the first half. Practise these thoughts.The rest of the work is in your behaviours. Act as though you trust him. Force yourself to not check or interrogate, and the less you check, the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel. Acting ""as if"" something if true strangely helps us believe it.It's possible to change the way we think, and this is turn changes the way we feel. Try this to start, and see a therapist for support and cognitive behavioural therapy if you want to dive more deeply into why this is happening and how to stop it. Good luck!","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's incredibly understandable why you're feeling this way. Your dad's betrayal has deeply impacted you, and it's completely natural that it's affecting your ability to trust in your current relationship. It's also really brave of you to recognize that this behavior is harmful and driving a wedge between you and your boyfriend. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, combining understanding the root of the problem with practical steps to take.  It's a process, so be patient with yourself.

**1. Understanding the Connection: Your Dad's Affair and Your Current Anxiety**

* **Learned Distrust:** You grew up witnessing a significant breach of trust. This doesn't mean everyone will betray you, but it *does* mean your brain learned that people capable of love and commitment *are* also capable of deception.  This creates a deep-seated anxiety about potential betrayal. It’s like your brain is now hypervigilant, scanning for danger.
* **Unresolved Grief & Anger:**  Even if your parents stayed together, or even if the affair happened a long time ago, there's likely unresolved grief, anger, and hurt surrounding it. You may be grieving the loss of the family you thought you had, or the security you believed in.  This emotional baggage is being projected onto your current relationship.
* **Control (Ironically):** While it feels like you’re protecting yourself, the constant checking is actually an attempt to *control* the uncertainty.  Because you felt powerless in your dad’s situation, you’re trying to regain control by meticulously monitoring your boyfriend.  This isn't healthy control, it's anxiety-driven control.
* **Mirroring:** Sometimes, we unconsciously repeat patterns we've experienced, even if we don't want to.  The act of ""secretly looking"" can mirror the secrecy of the affair, even though you're the one doing the looking.



**2.  The Problem with Your Current Behavior (Accessing His Accounts)**

Let's be very clear:  **Continually accessing your boyfriend's phone, social media, and email without his knowledge is a violation of his privacy, even if you haven’t found anything incriminating.** It erodes trust, even if he doesn't know you're doing it (yet).  You’ve already identified it's causing problems. Here's why it’s so damaging:

* **It Demonstrates Distrust:** It sends the message, “I don’t trust you enough to believe what you tell me.” That’s incredibly hurtful.
* **It’s Disrespectful:** Everyone is entitled to privacy.
* **It Creates a Toxic Dynamic:** It fosters secrecy and suspicion, even if he's completely innocent. It puts *you* in a position of being the one who is deceptive.
* **It Doesn’t Solve the Problem:** Finding nothing doesn’t alleviate your anxiety; it temporarily quiets it, and then you have to check again. It's a cycle.



**3. Steps to Break the Cycle and Heal**

This will take work, and likely professional help (see section 5). Here's a plan:

* **Stop the Checking – Cold Turkey:** This is the hardest part, but the most crucial. You *must* stop accessing his accounts.  Delete any saved passwords.  If you're tempted, remind yourself why you're doing this – to save your relationship and to heal yourself.  Consider having a friend or family member change your passwords for you.
* **Acknowledge Your Anxiety:** When you feel the urge to check, don't beat yourself up.  Instead, say to yourself, ""I'm feeling anxious right now. This is a result of my past experiences, not necessarily a reflection of my boyfriend's behavior.""
* **Identify Your Triggers:** What specifically triggers the urge to check? Is it when he's late coming home? When he's texting a friend? When he's at work?  Understanding your triggers allows you to prepare coping mechanisms.
* **Develop Coping Mechanisms:** When a trigger arises, use these instead of checking:
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Practice deep, slow breaths to calm your nervous system.
    * **Mindfulness/Meditation:**  Focus on the present moment. There are many apps (Headspace, Calm) that can help.
    * **Journaling:**  Write down your feelings and anxieties.  This can help you process them.
    * **Distraction:**  Engage in an activity you enjoy – reading, exercise, spending time with friends (not to gossip about your boyfriend, but to genuinely connect).
    * **Talk to Someone (see below):**  Share your feelings with a trusted friend, family member, or",0.5484171509742737,3.8542069852145076e-155,0.14634146341463414,0.27397260273972607
"I'm being verbally abused on a daily basis by my parents in front of my child. I feel like I’m trapped and I have no escape. I feel like I have to listen to the horrible things they say and just take all of it.
   I need some way of learning how to cope with listening to it especially since I have nowhere else to go. I feel very emotionally drained How can I deal with this?","Hello, I am sorry to hear about you feeling verbally abused, trapped without an escape, and emotionally drained. Sounds to me like you are being treated more like a child than an adult.  It's time to learn about healthy boundaries and being treated like an adult. This process will take time, but beyond elevating your self-esteem and worth, you will be modeling to your children a healthy adult. Model to them an empowered, confident, and person that is worthy of respect. Please invest in yourself. Find yourself a therapist that encourages and empowers you to have a voice and not feel invisible. You'll be so glad you did!","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult and painful. You're in a truly tough situation, being subjected to verbal abuse, *especially* with your child present, and feeling trapped with nowhere to go. It's completely understandable that you feel emotionally drained.  It's also incredibly brave of you to reach out and ask for help.  Here's a breakdown of coping strategies, focusing on what you can do *right now* given your limited options, and also some longer-term considerations.  I'll break it down into sections: **In the Moment, Protecting Your Child, Emotional Self-Care, and Long-Term Planning (even small steps).**  I'll also include a **Disclaimer** at the end, as this is serious and I'm not a substitute for professional help.

**1. In the Moment: Coping with the Verbal Abuse *While* It's Happening**

This is the hardest part, and it's about building internal defenses.  These aren't about changing *their* behavior (because you can't control that), but about changing *your* reaction to it to lessen the impact.

*   **Grey Rock Method:** This is a highly recommended technique for dealing with abusive people.  The idea is to become as uninteresting and unresponsive as a grey rock.  This means:
    *   **Minimal Engagement:**  Answer questions with short, neutral responses.  ""Yes,"" ""No,"" ""Okay,"" ""I see.""  Don't offer opinions, explanations, or get drawn into arguments.
    *   **Blank Expression:**  Try to keep your facial expression neutral.  Don't show anger, sadness, or frustration. (This is *extremely* difficult, but practice helps).
    *   **Avoid Eye Contact:**  Don't stare them down, but also don't look away excessively, which can be seen as submissive.  A soft, unfocused gaze can help.
    *   **Don't Defend, Explain, or Justify:** This is crucial.  Abusers often bait you into these, and it just fuels the cycle.
*   **Mental Rehearsal:**  Before you know you'll be around them, mentally rehearse these responses.  Imagine them saying something hurtful and practice responding with a neutral ""Okay.""
*   **Internal Mantra:** Have a short phrase you repeat to yourself internally during the abuse. Examples: ""This is not my fault,"" ""I am strong,"" ""I can survive this,"" ""This will pass,"" ""I am protecting my child.""
*   **Dissociation (as a short-term coping mechanism):** This is a more advanced technique, and it's about mentally detaching from the situation.  Imagine yourself watching a movie of what's happening, rather than *being* in it.  This is a temporary escape, not a long-term solution. (Be careful with this – it can be overused, but in acute moments, it can help).
*   **Focus on Your Breathing:**  Deep, slow breaths can help calm your nervous system.  Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth.
*   **Grounding Techniques:** If you feel overwhelmed, use grounding techniques to bring yourself back to the present moment.  Examples:
    *   **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    *   **Press your feet firmly into the floor.** Feel the sensation of your feet on the ground.

**2. Protecting Your Child**

This is paramount.  Even if you can't change the situation immediately, you can minimize the harm to your child.

*   **Intervene (Carefully):** If the abuse is directed *at* your child, you *must* intervene, even if it means facing more abuse yourself.  A firm, ""Please do not speak to [child's name] that way,"" is necessary.
*   **Counteract the Negativity:**  After an incident, actively counteract the negative messages with positive affirmations for your child.  Tell them you love them, that they are valuable, and that what was said was not true.
*   **Explain (Age-Appropriately):**  As your child gets older, explain (in a simple, age-appropriate way) that Grandma/Grandpa/etc. sometimes says hurtful things, and that it's not your child's fault.  Focus on *their* behavior, not on labeling your parents as ""bad"" people. (e.g., ""Grandma is feeling upset right now, and she's saying things she doesn't mean."")
*   **Limit Exposure:**  As much",0.49903392791748047,2.303707966464209e-155,0.0843989769820972,0.23759594477680554
What makes a healthy marriage last?,"In my mind, a healthy marriage has two participants, meaning both people participate equally in the intimate connection of marriage. An unequal participation comes in many forms, such as one person checking out of conversations when it becomes emotional, or speaking over and for each other in these conversations. Couple’s should strive for engagement and support, but doing it in a way that works for each person individually. I hope this helps.","Okay, this is a *big* question! There's no single magic formula, but decades of research in relationships, combined with what people in successful long-term marriages report, points to a lot of key ingredients. Here's a breakdown, categorized for clarity.  I'll try to be thorough, but this will still be a fairly lengthy answer because it's a complex topic!  I'll also separate ""foundational"" elements from things that are ongoing work.

**I. Foundational Elements (Things you ideally have *before* or early in marriage)**

These are the things that make a good base for building a lasting connection.  If these are shaky, the rest of the work is *much* harder.

*   **Compatibility:** This isn't about having *everything* in common, but about core values alignment.  Do you agree on big things like:
    *   **Life Goals:**  Do you both want children?  Where do you want to live? What are your career ambitions, and how do they mesh?
    *   **Financial Values:**  Are you both savers or spenders?  How will you manage money?  (This is a huge source of conflict if not addressed).
    *   **Religious/Spiritual Beliefs:**  Differences aren't necessarily dealbreakers, but understanding and respecting each other's beliefs (or lack thereof) is crucial.
    *   **Political Views:**  Again, not needing to be identical, but a significant disconnect can cause friction, especially in the current climate.
    *   **Views on Family:**  How important is family involvement?  What are your expectations for holidays and family gatherings?
*   **Mutual Respect:**  This sounds obvious, but it's *fundamental*.  It means valuing your partner's opinions, feelings, and individuality, even when you disagree. It involves avoiding contempt, criticism, and defensiveness (more on those later).
*   **Emotional Maturity:**  The ability to regulate your own emotions, take responsibility for your actions, and communicate needs and feelings in a healthy way.  This is HUGE.  Immature emotional responses (blaming, shutting down, rage) are relationship killers.
*   **Realistic Expectations:**  Marriage isn't a fairy tale.  There will be challenges, disagreements, and periods of boredom.  Believing in the idea of a perfect, effortless marriage sets you up for disappointment.
*   **Healthy Individual Identity:**  Each person should be a whole individual *before* entering marriage, with their own interests, friends, and sense of self.  Merging into one unit isn't healthy; maintaining individuality within the partnership is.
* **Attraction (Beyond the Initial Spark):** Physical and emotional attraction are important, but they evolve.  A foundation of genuine liking and appreciation for *who your partner is* is more enduring than just initial lust.



**II. Ongoing Work: The Habits & Skills of Lasting Marriages**

These are things you actively *do* throughout the marriage to nurture the connection.

*   **Communication:** This is often cited as the #1 factor. But it's not just *talking* – it's *how* you talk.
    *   **Active Listening:**  Truly hearing and understanding your partner's perspective, without interrupting or formulating your response.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Sharing your thoughts, feelings, and fears openly and honestly, even when it's scary.
    *   **""I"" Statements:**  Expressing your needs and feelings without blaming your partner (""I feel hurt when..."" instead of ""You always..."").
    *   **Regular Check-Ins:**  Making time to talk about how the relationship is going – not just logistics, but also emotional connection.
    *   **Fighting Fair:**  See section below on conflict resolution.
*   **Affection & Physical Touch:**  Regular displays of affection – hugs, kisses, holding hands, cuddling – maintain intimacy and connection. Physical touch releases oxytocin, the ""bonding hormone.""  This isn’t just about sex, although a healthy sex life is often part of a good marriage.
*   **Quality Time:**  Dedicated, focused time together, free from distractions (phones, work, kids). This could be date nights, shared hobbies, or simply having uninterrupted conversations.
*   **Appreciation & Gratitude:**  Expressing appreciation for your partner – both for big things and small gestures.  Focusing on the positive qualities and contributions of your spouse.  A simple ""thank you"" goes a long way.
*   **Acts of Service:**  Doing things for your partner that show you care and lighten their load.  This is one of the ""love languages"" (see resources below).
*   **Commitment & Forgiveness:**
    *   **Commitment:** A conscious decision to",0.48177391290664673,1.8986256482583404e-155,0.0684931506849315,0.20663700234192037
"I know that I need to get past my feelings for this person I fell in love with, but t's so difficult to move on because he showed me feelings I've never felt before. 

I feel like I don't  want to be without my genuine love for him, but logically, I know I need to be without him. I can't discuss this with anybody in my life because the conditions surrounding our love are considered  ""wrong"" by a lot of people.

How can I get myself to just move on?","It's difficult to move on and let go, especially when you've experienced things for the first time with someone, or feelings you've never felt before, as you said.I like the fact that you are looking at your situation ""logically"".  Feelings can take time to fade, but you seem to understand, even if it is subconsciously, that it's the feelings he stirred up in you that are keeping you tied to him, not necessarily the person himself. Realize that you can and will experience those feelings again with another person - the RIGHT person. Don't hold onto someone who is wrong for you just because of something like this. You're wanting those feelings and wanting a relationship - but with him necessarily? Or with anybody? You said you don't want to be without your love for him - not you don't want to be without him. In fact, you said you know you need to be without him. It seems like it's the LOVE that you can't let go of, and the feelings. Not the person. Trust me, you will find that again. Take some time to let this fade. Don't try to force him or anyone else into a role that is meant for someone else. Cherish the memories and the experiences you had. Sounds like it's been a valuable learning and growth experience for you, but you have your own reasons, and I don't know what they are, for thinking this person isn't good for you. Trust your gut instinct and be glad you've had this relationship. Not all are meant to last. But all shape you into the person you are and will become, and all teach us important lessons.","Okay, this is *really* tough. You're in a uniquely painful spot, caught between the intensity of your feelings and the reality of the situation, compounded by the isolation of not being able to talk openly about it. It's completely understandable that you're struggling. It's not just about losing *him*, it's about losing the *feeling* itself, and that's incredibly hard. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, broken down into sections, with a focus on self-compassion and navigating the secrecy:

**1. Validate Your Feelings - The Core of It All**

* **It's okay to grieve the loss of the *feeling*.** You're right to acknowledge that it's not just the person, but the newness and depth of emotion that's so hard to let go of.  You experienced something powerful, and grieving that is a legitimate and necessary process. Don't diminish it.  Saying to yourself, ""It's okay that I'm hurting. This was a significant experience for me, and it's natural to feel this way"" is crucial.
* **Acknowledge the ""wrongness"" adds to the pain.** The societal pressure and the inability to discuss it openly create a layer of shame and isolation that intensifies the grief.  Recognize that this makes it *harder*, not wrong. You're navigating this with an extra burden.
* **Don't self-blame.** Even if the circumstances are complicated, you didn't do anything wrong by *feeling* those feelings.  Love isn't something you control, it just *happens*.  



**2. Understanding Why Moving On is Necessary (Reinforce the Logic)**

You said you *logically* know you need to move on.  Let's unpack that a bit.  Write these reasons down, privately.  Not as a list of his flaws, but as a clear statement of *why this situation isn't sustainable for *you*.*

* **What specifically makes this unsustainable?** Be brutally honest with yourself.  Is it the potential for hurt to others? Is it a lack of future possibility?  Is it the emotional toll the secrecy is taking on you?  Is it fundamentally against your core values?
* **Focus on *your* well-being.**  Frame it as protecting yourself.  ""Staying connected to this, even emotionally, will prevent me from finding a relationship that *can* be fully realized and supported.""  ""I deserve a love that doesn't require secrecy and compromise.""
* **Future Self Perspective:** Imagine yourself a year from now. Would you be happier having stayed stuck in this, or having bravely moved on?  



**3.  Strategies for Emotional Detachment (Without Confiding)**

This is the hardest part, especially without a support system you can talk to.  These strategies are about redirecting your energy and weakening the emotional connection.

* **Limited Contact (Essential).**  This is likely already happening, but be firm.  Even seemingly innocent check-ins can reinforce the bond.  If complete cut-off isn't possible, minimize it to essential communication only.  Mute notifications.  Unfollow/hide on social media.
* **Thought Stopping/Reframing:** When you find yourself obsessing, consciously interrupt the thought pattern.  Say ""Stop"" (even aloud if you're alone).  Then, *immediately* redirect your focus to something else.  Reframing: Instead of thinking ""I miss him,"" try ""I miss the *feeling* of being cherished, and I will find that again.""  Or ""I'm learning to be okay with being alone and building my own happiness.""
* **Distraction is Your Friend (Initially).**  This isn’t about avoidance forever, but about giving yourself breathing room.  Immerse yourself in hobbies, work, exercise, books, movies, anything that absorbs your attention.  *Especially* things that require concentration.
* **Create New Experiences:**  Break out of your routine.  Take a class, learn a new skill, go on a weekend trip (even a solo one). New experiences create new neural pathways, shifting your focus away from the past.
* **Journaling (Very Important, Given the Secrecy):** This is your safe space.  Write down *everything* – your feelings, your fears, your frustrations, your hopes.  Don't censor yourself.  This is where you can be completely honest without judgment.  Write letters you don't send.  Write about your ideal future.
* **Self-Care is Non-Negotiable:**  Prioritize your physical and emotional health.  Eat well, sleep enough, exercise, meditate, spend time in nature.  These things build resilience and help you cope with stress.
* **Focus on",0.5703338980674744,0.022373180788309095,0.1487437185929648,0.31180035542213463
"I have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and I just had my first kiss five months ago. I’m worried that, at this rate, I won’t have a boyfriend for a very long time. The problem is that I want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, I don't want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex. I have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. Luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. I feel dirty by doing this, but I feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal.

Most people are surprised when they find out that I am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think I am really good looking. I am tall, I play lots of sports, and I get excellent grades in school. I am in my first year of university right now, and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest. It bothers me. Most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already. I feel like I will be single forever sometimes.","I think that every person who has been single for any extended period of time has felt the same worries - myself included. Since relationships are so important to us we fear not having them and being single. It is similar to fearing that we won't ever get a good job when we have been out of work for awhile or fearing that we won't be healthy when we have been sick. We fear these things because they are so important - not because these fears are realistic or true! There is immense pressure put on young single people from peers and media to conform to ideas of what is normal and to meet expectations in terms of sexual experience, dating, etc. While some people may judge an adult who is a virgin - others will respect your choices and feel even more attracted to you because of your choices. Experimenting with sex, so long as you are being safe and respectful is also completely okay and normal. Since expectations vary and we can't be happy if we are always comparing ourselves to other people, we need to ultimately trust that being who we are and building a loving relationship with ourselves is the key to meeting someone who will cherish us for all the ways that we are special and unique, virgin or not. When we are able to really accept ourselves and trust in our loveableness (not a real word but you get what I mean!) then meeting someone special is simply a matter of time and effort - putting ourselves out in the world in situations where we are likely to meet other single people looking for relationships. When you are most afraid of being alone - remember that this fear is simply a reminder of how much you value relationships. Use that passion about wanting relationships to build the best relationship you can with yourself and then one day soon some lucky person will stumble into your life and benefit immensely from your passion and your ability to be authentically who you are rather than pretending to be ""normal"" or whatever that is anyway. Hope this helps! ","Okay, this is a lot, and it's incredibly brave of you to share all of this. It sounds like you're carrying a *huge* weight of anxiety and self-criticism, and it's completely understandable why you're feeling this way. Let's break down what you've said and talk through it.  I'll try to offer support and some ways to think about things differently.  Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am an AI and cannot provide therapy.

**First, Let's Validate Your Feelings:**

* **Your feelings are valid.** It's okay to feel anxious, frustrated, and even sad about not having had a boyfriend or sexual experience by a certain age. Societal pressure, comparison to peers, and family expectations can be really intense. You're not ""wrong"" for wanting connection, intimacy, and a loving relationship.
* **The ""normal"" myth:** This is *huge*. There is *no* ""normal"" timeline for relationships or sexual experience.  Social media and conversations with friends often present a skewed picture.  People rarely advertise their struggles or insecurities. Everyone's journey is different.  The idea that you *should* be at a certain stage is incredibly damaging.
* **The conflict is real:** You're caught in a difficult situation. You desire intimacy with someone you care about, but you're also worried about time passing and feeling like you're ""falling behind."" This is a very common conflict, and you're not alone in experiencing it.
* **The guilt is understandable:** You're experiencing guilt and feeling ""dirty"" after the encounters with strangers, and that's because they didn't align with what *you* truly want – a connection and a relationship.  That mismatch is causing emotional distress.

**Let's Address the Specific Issues:**

* **The Hookups and the Pressure:** You've identified that you engaged in these encounters partly to feel ""normal"" and alleviate pressure. This is a crucial insight! It shows you recognize that you were acting from a place of insecurity, not genuine desire.  Those feelings of guilt are a sign that those encounters didn't serve your emotional wellbeing.  It's good you were fortunate to encounter respectful people, but that doesn’t negate the fact that it wasn’t what you wanted.  Recognizing this pattern is the first step to breaking it.
* **The Virginity Concern:** The desire to lose your virginity to someone you love is very healthy and reasonable.  You deserve that.  However, *don't let the virginity itself become the focus*. It's not a milestone you *need* to achieve to be worthy or valuable. It's a personal decision, and it should be made when *you* are ready, with someone you trust and care for.
* **The Lack of Attention:** It’s incredibly disheartening to feel overlooked, especially when you feel you have a lot to offer. It's easy to internalize that as a reflection of your worth, but it's almost certainly *not* the case. There are many reasons why people don't approach others: they might be shy, intimidated, already in a relationship, or simply not a good match.  It says nothing about *you*.
* **Family Expectations:**  Comparing yourself to family members is a trap. Everyone’s life unfolds differently. Your path is your own.  While it's natural to consider their experiences, don't let them dictate your feelings or create unnecessary pressure.
* **The ""Single Forever"" Fear:** This is anxiety talking. It’s a cognitive distortion – a thought pattern that isn’t based in reality. You are young! You have plenty of time to find meaningful connections.



**What Can You Do?**

1. **Self-Compassion:** This is the most important thing.  Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend.  Challenge those negative self-talk patterns. Replace ""I'll be single forever"" with ""I'm worthy of love, and I'm open to finding it when the time is right.""
2. **Focus on *You*:**  Continue investing in the things you enjoy: sports, school, hobbies.  This builds confidence and makes you a more interesting and fulfilled person.  Attractiveness isn't just physical; it's about radiating happiness and passion.
3. **Challenge the ""Normal"" Narrative:** Actively question the expectations you've internalized.  Talk to friends (the supportive ones!) about their experiences.  You'll likely find that many of them have similar anxieties.
4. **Re-evaluate Your Approach to Connection:** Instead of focusing on ""getting a boyfriend,"" focus on building genuine connections with people. Join clubs, volunteer, participate in activities you enjoy.  This increases your chances of meeting",0.5499075651168823,6.80744250064578e-79,0.12623985572587917,0.29174614923081926
"The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headaches—mostly mouth breathing and snoring. It makes me angry, and I want to solve it myself.","Probably good to know in what type of situations you are, in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoring.If you're sleeping beside your partner who does these actions, would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchen.Basically, if the person who does these actions which bother you, start by telling them.Depending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds, or not, willing to change, or not, has a good deal to do with next steps.I don't really see any step you're able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the head.One path I don't recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered, or dismissing your own sensitivity someone.Your needs matter.","Okay, this is really tough, and I'm glad you're acknowledging it and wanting to find solutions.  It sounds like you're experiencing **misophonia**, a condition where specific sounds trigger strong negative emotional and physiological responses. It's *very* common to feel anger, anxiety, and even physical symptoms like headaches.  It's good you want to address it yourself initially, but I'll also include information on when professional help is important.  Let's break down a plan, combining coping strategies and potential solutions.

**Understanding What's Happening (and Why It's Hard to 'Just Get Over It')**

* **It's Neurological:** Misophonia isn't just being ""annoyed.""  It's believed to involve a neurological difference in how the brain processes certain sounds.  The sounds often trigger a fight-or-flight response, even though there's no actual danger. This is why the anger is so intense.
* **Triggers are Specific:** It's usually *specific* sounds, not just all sounds.  You've identified yours: eating sounds and breathing sounds (mouth breathing, snoring).  This is key to understanding and managing it.
* **It's Involuntary:** The reaction is often immediate and difficult to control. You don't *choose* to get angry.
* **It's Not About the Sound Itself:**  The sound itself isn't inherently offensive. It's the *reaction* your brain has to it.  



**I. Immediate Coping Strategies (When You're In the Moment)**

These are things you can try *right when* you start to feel the reaction building.  They're about managing the immediate distress.

* **Earplugs/Noise-Cancelling Headphones:**  This is your first line of defense.  High-quality earplugs (foam, wax, or custom-molded) or noise-cancelling headphones can significantly reduce the intensity of the trigger.  Keep them readily available. Experiment with different types to see what works best for you.
* **White Noise/Sound Masking:**  Instead of complete silence (which can make you hyper-aware), use white noise (fan, static, rain sounds), nature sounds, music (instrumental is often better), or a sound masking app.  This can help to drown out or camouflage the triggering sounds.  Try different sounds to see what is most effective.
* **Distraction Techniques:**  Force yourself to focus on something else. This takes practice!
    * **Mental Math:**  Start doing calculations in your head.
    * **Visual Focus:**  Pick an object and describe it in detail to yourself (color, shape, texture).
    * **Verbal Repetition:**  Silently repeat a mantra or phrase (""calm,"" ""peace,"" ""it will pass"").
    * **Physical Activity:**  Clench and release your fists, tap your feet, or do a quick stretch.
* **Breathing Exercises:**  Slow, deep breathing can help calm your nervous system.  Try the 4-7-8 technique: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds.
* **Grounding Techniques:**  Bring yourself back to the present moment.
    * **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear (besides the trigger), 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Focus on Physical Sensations:**  Feel your feet on the ground, the texture of your clothes, the temperature of the air.
* **Briefly Remove Yourself:** If possible, politely excuse yourself from the situation.  Even a few minutes in a quieter space can help you reset.



**II.  Longer-Term Strategies (To Reduce Reactivity Over Time)**

These take consistent effort, but can make a big difference.

* **Trigger Tracking:**  Keep a journal to document your reactions.  Note:
    * The specific sound.
    * The situation (where were you, who was present).
    * Your emotional and physical response (headache intensity, anger level).
    * What coping strategies you tried, and how effective they were.
    *  Patterns will emerge, helping you anticipate and prepare.
* **Counterconditioning (This is KEY, but requires patience):**  This is about gradually changing your brain's association with the trigger sound.  *Start small!*
    1. **Identify a low-intensity version of the trigger:**  Maybe it’s a very quiet recording of someone eating, or a barely audible sniffle.
    2. **Pair it with something positive:**  Listen to the low-intensity sound *while* doing something you",0.5015456676483154,2.6589544858702205e-155,0.10181818181818181,0.24141363862618223
I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.,"First I think we have to acknowledge that you are doing something amazing.  You are putting yourself out there and becoming a Water Safety Instructor.   We often times will focus on the negative and forget about the positive.  Next, you had an incident where someone pointed something out which may have caused embarrassment.  Whether or not it was malicious on his part I think the important thing to focus on is what is called ""Common Humanity"".  Common Humanity is one of the three elements of self-compassion.  Common humanity essentially recognizes that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the shared human experience.  While you may have had this embarrassing moment at this time, that boy may have had an embarrassing moment another day.  We all have embarrassing moments.  When we recognize that we do not suffer in isolation then we are able to move past that suffering.  Additionally another element to self-compassion is self-kindness.  My question is why must you forgive yourself?  Rather, be kind to yourself for learning an amazing new talent.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and I'm so sorry this happened to you. It's completely understandable that you're embarrassed. It's awful to be made to feel self-conscious, *especially* when you're trying to do something positive like becoming a Water Safety Instructor. Here's a breakdown of how to process this, what likely happened, and how to move forward, covering emotional support, practical steps, and how to handle similar situations in the future.  I'll try to be thorough.

**1. Validating Your Feelings**

*   **It's not your fault.** Absolutely none of this is your fault. You were put in a difficult position, and someone behaved inappropriately.  His comment was inappropriate, rude, and frankly, sexual harassment.  You were doing your job, and you shouldn't have to worry about someone's inappropriate comments.
*   **Embarrassment is normal.** It’s *completely* normal to feel embarrassed, ashamed, or even angry after something like this.  Don't beat yourself up for how you reacted in the moment.  It's a shock to be put on the spot like that.
*   **You are not responsible for his behavior.** His comment reflects *his* issues, not anything about you. He's the one who needs to learn appropriate behavior.



**2. Understanding What Likely Happened**

*   **Swimsuit Fit & Water Dynamics:** Swimsuits behave *differently* in the water than they do on land. Water can cause fabric to stretch, become more revealing, or cling in unexpected ways. What felt secure out of the water might not have felt secure *during* movement in the water. This is a very common issue for people who are active in the water.  It's why WSI training often has specific guidance on appropriate swimwear.
*   **His Immaturity & Inappropriateness:**  A young boy, regardless of his age, *should not* be commenting on someone's body or clothing. It’s a boundary violation.  He likely doesn't understand the implications of what he said, but that doesn't excuse it. He may be going through puberty and dealing with confusing feelings.  Again, this doesn't make it okay.
*   **Power Dynamic:** As the adult instructor, there's a power dynamic at play. His comment could be a way of trying to assert himself or make you uncomfortable, even if he didn't consciously realize it.



**3. What You Can Do Now - Addressing Your Feelings & Taking Action**

*   **Talk to Someone:** This is *really* important. Don't keep this bottled up.
    *   **Your Trainer/Instructor:** This is the most important person to talk to. They need to know what happened.  They can offer support, guidance, and help ensure it doesn’t happen to you or others.  They also have a responsibility to address the student's behavior.  You can say something like:  ""I wanted to let you know that during the class, one of the students made an inappropriate comment about my swimsuit. It was very upsetting and made me feel uncomfortable. I'd like to discuss how to handle this and ensure it doesn't happen again.""
    *   **A Trusted Friend or Family Member:**  Sharing with someone you trust can help you process your emotions.
    *   **Counselor/Therapist:** If you're really struggling, consider talking to a professional. They can provide coping strategies and help you build confidence.
*   **Document the Incident:** Write down exactly what happened, including the date, time, what was said, and any witnesses. This is important if you need to take further action.
*   **Address the Swimsuit:** (See Section 4 below for detailed advice).  Getting a properly fitting and appropriate swimsuit is key.
* **Self-Care:** Do something kind for yourself. Take a bath, read a book, listen to music, or do anything that helps you relax and de-stress.



**4. Getting the Right Swimsuit – Practical Steps**

*   **Talk to Your Instructor/Trainer:**  Ask for specific guidelines on acceptable swimwear for WSIs. They should be able to tell you what's appropriate for your training facility and the image they want instructors to project.
*   **Key Features to Look For:**
    *   **Secure Fit:** This is the *most* important. The swimsuit should stay in place during vigorous activity (swimming, treading water, demonstrating skills).  Test it out! Jump around, do arm circles, simulate rescue movements.
    *   **Coverage:** Consider a suit with more coverage, especially if you're feeling self-conscious.  Options include:
        *   **Racerback or T-back styles:**  Provide more support and",0.5063608288764954,0.013985701981029948,0.10526315789473685,0.2463531585141023

"My mother is combative with me when I say I don't want to talk with her about my depression.  

She hasn't been supportive of me in the past and she isn't someone that I feel comfortable opening up to. She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I don't want to or can't answer. I tell her I don't want to talk and she starts arguments with me. 

How can I get her to understand?","Your situation sounds extremely frustrating.You're doing the right move to state you don't want to discuss your depression with her.I guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression.  If you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation, and you would like to tell her your true reason, then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time, not in the middle of an argument.Having an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept.  You may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's incredibly valid that you're trying to protect yourself. It's *your* mental health, and you get to decide who you share it with. It's frustrating and hurtful when a parent doesn't respect those boundaries, especially when they're supposed to be a source of support. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, focusing on strategies, scripts, and understanding why this is happening (which doesn't excuse it, but can help you navigate it).

**1. Understanding the Dynamics (Why she might be reacting this way)**

Before diving into what *you* can do, it's helpful (though not essential) to consider *why* your mother is reacting this way. This isn't about excusing her behavior, but understanding it can help you choose the most effective approach. Some possibilities:

*   **She feels rejected:**  She may perceive your unwillingness to share as a rejection of *her*, not just of the topic.  Parents often want to feel needed and involved in their children's lives.
*   **She doesn't understand depression:** She may view depression as ""sadness"" or something you can ""snap out of,"" and believes she can ""fix"" it with advice.
*   **Control issues:**  Some parents have a need to be in control, and your boundaries feel like a loss of control.
*   **Her own unresolved issues:** She might be projecting her own anxieties or experiences onto you.  She may have struggled and never had support, and now feels she *should* provide it (even if her approach is unhelpful).
*   **Guilt/Fear:** She may feel guilty about past lack of support and is now overcompensating in a clumsy way, or she's fearful of what depression means for you.
*   **Generational Differences:** Older generations often have different views on mental health and may not understand the importance of professional help or personal boundaries.

**2. Strategies for Setting and Maintaining Boundaries**

*   **Be Firm and Consistent:** This is *key*.  You need to consistently reinforce your boundary, even when she pushes back.  Giving in even once makes it harder next time.
*   **""Broken Record"" Technique:**  Repeat a simple statement calmly and repeatedly, without getting drawn into arguments. (See scripts below).
*   **Grey Rock Method:**  Become uninteresting.  Give brief, factual answers without emotion or detail.  This is especially helpful when she's probing.
*   **Limit Contact (If Necessary):** If her behavior is severely impacting your mental health, you may need to temporarily reduce contact. This is a last resort, but a valid self-care strategy.
*   **Focus on Your Needs, Not Her Reactions:**  This is hard, but important.  You are not responsible for her feelings about your boundaries.  Your responsibility is to protect yourself.
*   **Don’t JADE (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain):**  You don’t owe her an explanation for *why* you don't want to talk. This just invites her to argue.



**3. Scripts You Can Use**

Here are some scripts, tailored for different situations.  Practice them so they feel more natural.  Adapt them to your own voice.

*   **When she starts to ask probing questions:**

    *   ""Mom, I'm not going to discuss this with you.  I appreciate your concern, but this is something I'm handling privately."" (Repeat as needed).
    *   ""I understand you want to know, but I'm not comfortable talking about this right now.""
    *   (Grey Rock) ""I'm okay."" or ""Things are... okay."" (and then change the subject).
*   **When she gets combative/starts an argument:**

    *   ""I'm not going to argue about this.  I've stated my boundary, and I'm ending this conversation."" (Then *immediately* disengage – hang up the phone, leave the room, etc.).

    *   ""It sounds like you're having a hard time with this, and I respect that. But I still won't be discussing my depression with you.""

"Over the years, I have slowly lost everything: my jobs, my cars, my freedom, and my money. I am a stay-at-home mom who doesn't make any money, doesn't have a car, never goes out, and cleans all day long everyday.","There are an infinite number of possibilities here. You included a lot of things that you don't have. Is there anyway that you can have some freedom for a few hours a week, at least? A lot of times stay at home moms have groups when they meet at different public places where their children can play together and they can talk together. I don't know how old your child or children is/are, but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the future.I wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you. I don't know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things. I wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted? If you can sort out some possible answers to that, maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happen.Also, again depending on the age of your children, some parents can do things while the children are sleeping, even if you are in the same room. For example, if your children are sleeping for about two hours, maybe 30 minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do.","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult, and it takes courage to even *say* this out loud. It sounds like you're feeling a profound sense of loss and are stuck in a really isolating and exhausting situation. It's completely understandable that you're reaching out, even just to put it into words.  Let's break this down, and I'll try to offer some thoughts and potential starting points.  I'll cover a lot, so please don't feel like you need to address everything at once.  It's about finding *one* small thing to start with.

**First, acknowledging the weight of this:**

* **Loss is cumulative trauma:** Losing jobs, possessions, freedom, and financial security are all significant losses, and they build up over time.  It's not just the individual things, but the collective impact on your sense of self, your hope, and your future.
* **Isolation is devastating:** Not having a car and not going out contributes to isolation, which can worsen feelings of depression, anxiety, and hopelessness.  It creates a cycle that's hard to break.
* **The invisibility of housework:**  Being a stay-at-home mom is *work* – incredibly demanding work.  But it's often unpaid and undervalued, which can lead to feeling invisible and without worth. Cleaning all day, while necessary, can feel relentless and unfulfilling.
* **You're in a tough spot, and it's okay to not be okay.**  This isn't a matter of ""pulling yourself up by your bootstraps."" This sounds like a situation where support is genuinely needed.



**Let's try to think about potential steps forward.  I'm going to organize this into sections: Emotional Wellbeing, Practical Steps, and Reclaiming Yourself.**  I'll also include a section on **Seeking Help** because you shouldn't have to do this alone.

**1. Emotional Wellbeing (This is the *most* important starting point)**

* **Acknowledge your feelings:**  Allow yourself to feel the sadness, anger, frustration, and grief.  Don't try to suppress them.  Journaling can be a helpful outlet, even if it's just writing down a few words each day.
* **Self-Compassion:**  Be kind to yourself.  You've been through a lot. Talk to yourself the way you would talk to a friend going through the same thing.  Avoid self-blame.  This isn't about *who* is at fault, it's about acknowledging the situation and finding a way forward.
* **Small moments of joy:**  Even when things feel bleak, try to find small moments of joy.  A warm cup of tea, listening to music, reading a book, a few minutes of sunshine – these small things can make a difference.
* **Mindfulness/Grounding:**  When you feel overwhelmed, try simple mindfulness exercises.  Focus on your breath, notice the sensations in your body, or pay attention to the sounds around you.  This can help bring you back to the present moment.
* **Consider Therapy:**  If possible, even online therapy can be incredibly beneficial. A therapist can provide a safe space to process your feelings and develop coping strategies. (See ""Seeking Help"" section below for resources).

**2. Practical Steps (Start *small*.  Don't try to overhaul everything at once.)**

* **Assess Your Finances (even if it's limited):**  What income *does* come into the household?  Can you create a basic budget?  Understanding your financial situation, even if it's tight, is empowering.
* **Explore Low-Cost/Free Activities:**  Are there free community events? Libraries often have programs.  Can you walk to a park or a nearby area?  Even a change of scenery can help.
* **Skills Assessment:** What skills do you have?  Even skills developed as a stay-at-home mom (organization, time management, problem-solving, patience) are valuable.  Could any of these be translated into a potential income stream?
* **Remote Work (Start Researching):** Since you don't have a car, remote work is a good option. Here are some ideas to investigate (beware of scams – research any company thoroughly before applying):
    * **Freelance Writing/Editing:** If you have good writing skills.
    * **Virtual Assistant:**  Administrative tasks, scheduling, email management.
    * **Customer Service Representative:** Many companies hire remote customer service reps.
    * **Data Entry:** Can be tedious, but a starting point.
    * **Transcription:** Converting audio to text.
    * **Online Tutoring:** If you have expertise in a particular subject.
* **Transportation Options (Explore Locally):**  Is there public transportation?",0.49305474758148193,7.698860888738006e-79,0.12314225053078558,0.25636363636363635
"I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I can't afford to live alone.

My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules. She is trying to control my life. What should I do?","That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now.  The first thing to under is that you can’t change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior.  The thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions.  You may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan. The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior.  Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy.  Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack.  There are ways you can deal with controlling parents – and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you’ll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they’re trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you’re losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust. There aren’t any quick tips on how to deal with parents who want to control you; you need to find strategies that are geared to your specific family situation.  Get specific coping tips from books about family dynamics, such as:Toxic Parents: Overcoming Their Hurtful Legacy and Reclaiming Your Life by Susan ForwardCutting Loose: An Adult's Guide to Coming to Terms with Your Parents by Howard HalpernA counselor can be a good resource and provide support and guidance about issues addressing normal growth and development during periods of transition.  ","Okay, this is a *very* common situation, especially for people in their early 20s right now with the cost of living being what it is. It's tough balancing gratitude for your parents' support with the need for independence. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering everything from understanding the situation to possible actions you can take.  I'll try to be thorough.

**1. Understand the Dynamics at Play**

* **Your Mother's Perspective:**  It's important to try to see things from her side, even if you disagree.  She likely has a few core motivations:
    * **Concern for Your Well-being:** She genuinely cares about you and wants you to succeed. Her ""rules"" might stem from a belief she knows what's best.
    * **Habit of Control:**  She's been a parent for 20+ years.  It's *hard* to shift from that role.  She's used to making decisions for you.
    * **Financial Justification:**  She feels justified in setting rules because she's providing a significant financial benefit (housing).  She might feel like you ""owe"" her compliance.
    * **Cultural/Generational Differences:**  Parental expectations and the timing of independence vary significantly across cultures and generations.
* **Your Perspective:** You're an adult (or very close to it) and deserve respect and autonomy. You need space to learn, make mistakes, and figure out your own life, even if it means stumbling sometimes. Being controlled can stifle your growth and lead to resentment.
* **The Power Imbalance:**  The financial dependency *does* create a power imbalance.  Recognizing this is crucial.  It doesn't make her wrong, but it explains why direct confrontation can be difficult.



**2. Identify the Specific Issues**

Before you do anything, get *very* clear on what specifically feels controlling.  Instead of thinking ""she controls my life,"" break it down.  Examples:

* **Curfew:**  Is she setting a curfew?
* **Social Life:**  Is she questioning who you spend time with or discouraging social activities?
* **Dating Life:** Is she interfering in your dating life?
* **Career/Education:** Is she dictating what you should study or what job you should take?
* **Finances (beyond rent/bills):** Is she controlling how you spend your own money?
* **Chores/Household Rules:** Are the household rules unreasonable or specifically targeted at you in a controlling way (vs. general household expectations)?
* **Personal Choices:** Is she trying to dictate your appearance, hobbies, or beliefs?

Write these down.  Having a list will help you communicate more effectively and prioritize what's most important to address.



**3. Communication Strategies (This is Key)**

* **Choose the Right Time:** Don't bring this up when you're both stressed or in the middle of an argument.  Pick a calm, quiet moment.
* **""I"" Statements:**  This is crucial. Focus on how her actions *make you feel* rather than accusing her.
    * **Instead of:** ""You're always trying to control me!""
    * **Try:** ""I feel suffocated when I'm constantly questioned about my plans.""  or ""I feel like my opinions aren't respected when...""
* **Acknowledge Her Help:** Start by expressing gratitude for her allowing you to live at home.  ""Mom, I really appreciate you letting me live here while I get on my feet. It's a huge help.""
* **Frame it as Growth:**  Explain that you need to develop independence to become a fully functioning adult.  ""I'm trying to learn how to manage my own life, and that includes making my own decisions, even if they aren't always perfect.""
* **Focus on Specifics:** Refer back to your list of issues.  ""I'd really like to be able to decide my own weekend plans without having to check in.""
* **Compromise (Be Prepared to Offer One):**  This is where it gets tricky.  You might say, ""I understand you worry about me, and I'm happy to keep you updated on my general plans, but I need some freedom to make those plans myself.""
* **Active Listening:**  Actually *listen* to her response.  Try to understand her concerns.  Don't just wait for your turn to talk.
* **Be Respectful, Even When Disagreeing:**  Maintain a calm tone and avoid raising your voice.
* **Set Boundaries (Gently but Firmly):** ""I understand your concern, but this is something I need to handle on my own.""




**4.  Financial Independence as Leverage**

This is the",0.5247952342033386,8.402332668209488e-79,0.1417004048582996,0.290612035396864
"My ex-husband told my two adolescents that Santa doesn't exist on the day before Christmas. They are desperate to hold on to the magic of Christmas, but I don't know if it's right for me to lie to them and tell them that Santa is real. I don't want to let them down and make them lose out on those memories, but I also don't want to lose their trust.","Well Boise, the cat's out of the bag now, isn't it? I love that you want to help your kids keep the magic of Christmas. They must want that too if they still believe in Santa into their teen years, which is unusual, I believe. I wonder if they had already figured it out anyway?But they know now, and your ex had the right to tell them if he felt it was best. So it's time to explain to them what a loving and magical thing it is that parents do, and Christmas can still be magical in so many ways. Really, who says they have to stop believing in Santa? Santa is very real as a spirit of surprise, generosity and love. ","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and your ex-husband's timing was...less than ideal, to put it mildly. You're right to feel conflicted. You're balancing wanting to preserve a cherished childhood experience with the very important goal of maintaining your children's trust. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, with several options, and things to consider, categorized for clarity.  I'll also try to address the trust issue head-on.

**1. Understanding the Damage & Your Kids' Needs**

* **Your Ex's Action:** What he did was unkind and disrespectful to both your kids and *you* as a co-parent. It took away their agency to discover this on their own terms, and it put you in a horrible position.  Acknowledging that is important, even if it's just to yourself.
* **Adolescent Development:** The age of your adolescents is key. Are they 13? 15? The older they are, the more they're likely already questioning things.  A 13-year-old is different than a 15-year-old in terms of emotional maturity and their need for ""magic.""
* **What do *they* want?**  This is the most crucial question.  Before you do *anything*, talk to them (individually, perhaps) and find out how they're feeling.  Ask open-ended questions like:
    * ""I'm so sorry your dad told you about Santa. How did that make you feel?""
    * ""What are your thoughts about Santa now that you know?""
    * ""Are you feeling sad about it? Angry? Confused?""
    * ""What would make you feel better about this right now?""
    *  ""Do you *want* to still pretend for a little while, or do you want to move on?""
    * ""What parts of Christmas are most important to you?"" (This helps you understand if it's *just* Santa, or the whole feeling of wonder).



**2. Your Options – and the Trust Factor**

Here are a few approaches, ranked from most ""preserving of the magic"" to most ""direct truth,"" with a look at how they affect trust.  I'll also give a ""Trust Impact"" score (1-5, 1 being lowest impact, 5 being highest).

* **Option A: The ""Keep the Spirit Alive"" Approach (Trust Impact: 3/5)**
    * **What it is:** Acknowledge their dad told them, validate their feelings, and then frame Santa as a *spirit* of generosity, kindness, and the joy of giving.  ""Your dad told you Santa isn't one person who delivers presents, and that's true. But the *idea* of Santa – the spirit of giving to others, of believing in something magical – that's real.  We keep that spirit alive by *being* Santa for others, by doing kind things for people, and by enjoying the wonder of Christmas.""  You could say, ""Maybe now that you know the secret, you can help *us* keep the magic alive for younger kids.""
    * **Pros:** Preserves some of the magic, allows them to still feel special, reinforces positive values.  Doesn't require a direct lie.
    * **Cons:**  It's a bit of a sidestep.  They might see through it as a softened version of a lie.  Requires careful wording.
    * **When to use:** Best for kids who are genuinely heartbroken and want to cling to the magic, especially if they're on the younger end of adolescence (13ish).

* **Option B:  The ""Partial Truth/Evolution"" Approach (Trust Impact: 2/5)**
    * **What it is:** ""What your dad said is true, there isn't *one* man who flies around the world. But the story of Santa Claus started a long time ago with a real person, St. Nicholas, who was incredibly kind and generous. Over time, the story grew and grew, and now *we* all participate in keeping his spirit alive.  The magic isn't about a man in a suit, it's about the love and joy we share at Christmas.""  You can add, ""We can still enjoy the traditions, and maybe even *become* Santa for others.""
    * **Pros:**  Combines truth with a gentle transition.  Explains the origins of the story.  Focuses on the positive aspects.
    * **Cons:** Still requires some explanation and re-framing. Might feel a bit like ""damage control.""
    * **When to use:** Good for kids who are questioning but not entirely devastated.  Works well if they're curious about the history of Christmas traditions",0.5007372498512268,0.013102872512292757,0.0966183574879227,0.29686279511360925
"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","Yes, if crying is how you are expressing an emotion, then not only would it be normal, but hopefully encouraged, because it's an important part of therapy to have a safe space to express your emotions. We might encourage you to put words to the tears as well, to help you expand on your experience and begin to make more sense of it.As a therapist, our job is help you open up and feel comfortable enough doing so. I sincerely hope no therapist would ever shame you for whatever experience you are having in the room.","Okay, it's *completely* normal to be freaking out before starting therapy, and your fear about crying and feeling embarrassed is a super common one! Honestly, you're far from alone in worrying about that. Let's break it down and hopefully ease your mind a little.

**Is it something to worry about? Absolutely not.**

Here's why:

* **Therapy *is* a safe space for emotions.**  That's literally its purpose.  It's designed to be a place where you can feel *all* the feelings, without judgment.  A good therapist *expects* people to cry. It's not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of being human and allowing yourself to feel.
* **Therapists are trained to handle tears.** They've seen it all. They have tissues readily available (seriously, they do!). They know how to navigate emotional release and won't be thrown off by your tears.  In fact, they can often learn a *lot* from them.
* **Crying is a healthy release.**  Holding things in can be incredibly damaging.  Crying can be a way to process grief, stress, pain, or just overwhelming feelings.  It's physically and emotionally cleansing.
* **""Embarrassment"" is a feeling, and it's okay to *feel* embarrassed.** If you *do* feel embarrassed, you can even *tell* your therapist!  ""I'm feeling really embarrassed right now, and I'm sorry I'm crying"" is a perfectly valid thing to say.  They can help you explore *why* you're feeling embarrassed.
* **It's not a performance.** You aren't being *graded* on how ""well"" you handle your emotions.  This isn't about putting on a brave face. It's about being authentic.

**Why you might be afraid of crying in therapy:**

* **Vulnerability:** Therapy requires vulnerability, and showing emotion feels vulnerable.  
* **Fear of judgment:** You might worry your therapist will think you're ""too much"" or ""dramatic.""  (A good therapist won't!)
* **Past experiences:** Maybe you were taught to suppress emotions growing up, or had a negative experience being vulnerable in the past.
* **Control:**  Crying can feel like losing control, and it's scary to lose control, especially when you're already feeling uneasy about starting therapy.



**What can you do to prepare (and soothe your anxiety)?**

* **Acknowledge your fear:**  You've already done this! Saying ""I'm afraid I'll cry"" is a great first step.
* **Remind yourself of the points above:** Therapy is *for* this.
* **It's okay to say you're anxious:**  You can tell your therapist right at the beginning, ""I'm feeling really nervous about this, and I'm worried I might cry.""  This sets the stage for openness.
* **Have tissues handy:** If it makes you feel more prepared, bring a small pack of tissues with you.
* **Practice self-compassion:**  Be kind to yourself. Starting therapy is brave.  Allow yourself to feel whatever you feel.
* **Remember you can pause:** You are in control of the session. If you feel overwhelmed, you can say, ""I need a moment,"" or ""Can we pause?""
* **Focus on what you *want* to get out of therapy:**  Remind yourself of your goals.  The discomfort of potential tears is likely small compared to the potential benefits of therapy.




**What if you *do* cry?**

* **It's okay.** Just let it happen.
* **Your therapist will likely just offer you a tissue and a supportive silence.** They'll let you process.
* **They may ask gentle questions:**  Like ""What's coming up for you right now?"" or ""What does that feel like?""
* **You don't have to explain *why* you're crying if you don't want to.**



**Bottom line:**  Your fear is understandable, but it's really not something to worry about.  Crying in therapy is normal, healthy, and your therapist is prepared for it.  You are taking a really brave step, and you deserve to feel safe and supported.

You've got this.  And if you need to talk more about your anxiety before your appointment, feel free to share.  I'm here to listen.

"I’m a man, and I’m soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but it’s been happening a lot. I don't know what to do.","I would start by examining the reasons for seeking out other relationships. Are you getting something from the other men that you do not currently receive from your current partner? Such as, is it more exciting with others and that excitement is lacking in your current relationship?","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's good that you're recognizing the gravity of it and reaching out, even anonymously. You're facing a significant crisis, and the path forward will require honesty, courage, and a lot of self-reflection. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, divided into sections.  It's long, but this is a complex issue, and deserves a thorough response.  I'll also include a *very important disclaimer* at the end.

**1. Understanding the Core Issues**

Before you do *anything* else, you need to understand *why* this is happening. ""It just happened"" is rarely the full story. Here are some questions to ask yourself – and be brutally honest with your answers.  This is for *you*, not anyone else, so there's no need to sugarcoat things.  Journaling can be incredibly helpful here.

*   **What needs are you meeting through these encounters that aren't being met in your relationship?** (This is *crucial*. Is it sexual variety? Emotional connection? Validation? A sense of excitement? Feeling desired? Something else?)  Don't blame your partner; focus on *your* needs.
*   **What are your feelings about your upcoming marriage?** Are you having doubts? Fears? Are you truly ready for this level of commitment?  Is a part of you sabotaging things?
*   **What are your beliefs about monogamy?** Have you always believed in it?  Is this a recent shift in your thinking?  Are you comfortable with the idea of a monogamous relationship, deep down?
*   **What is your relationship like with your fiancé?**  Is it emotionally intimate?  Are you able to communicate openly and honestly with her?  Is there conflict you're avoiding?  Is there a lack of physical intimacy?
*   **What is your attachment style?** (Look up ""attachment theory"" - anxious, avoidant, secure). Understanding your attachment style can shed light on patterns in your relationships.
*   **Are there underlying issues like anxiety, depression, or past trauma that might be contributing to this behavior?** These can often manifest in destructive ways.
* **What are your values?** Does this behavior align with your personal values? The disconnect between your actions and values is likely causing you distress.



**2.  The Immediate Decision: To Tell or Not to Tell**

This is the hardest part, and there's no easy answer.  Both options have significant consequences.

*   **Telling Her:**
    *   **Pros:** Honesty *can* be the foundation for rebuilding trust (though it's a long shot).  It gives her the agency to make an informed decision about whether she wants to marry you, knowing the full truth. It might alleviate your guilt and stress in the long run.
    *   **Cons:**  It could shatter her trust and end the marriage before it begins. It will cause immense pain. It requires immense courage and a willingness to accept full responsibility.  There's a high probability it will end the relationship.
*   **Not Telling Her:**
    *   **Pros:**  You avoid the immediate fallout and the potential end of the marriage.  (However, this is a short-term ""benefit"").
    *   **Cons:**  You are building your marriage on a foundation of deception.  The secret will likely eat away at you, causing anxiety and potentially leading to more infidelity.  If it *does* come out later (and secrets often do), the damage will be even greater.  You're denying her the chance to make a choice based on reality.  You are, essentially, choosing to live a lie.

**If you are leaning towards *not* telling her, you *absolutely* need to address the underlying reasons why you're engaging in this behavior (see section 1 and 3).  Otherwise, you're just delaying the inevitable and potentially inflicting more harm in the future.**

**I strongly recommend telling her, as difficult as it is.  While it may end the relationship, it's the most ethical course of action and gives her the respect she deserves.**



**3.  Taking Action (Regardless of Whether You Tell Her)**

Regardless of your decision about disclosure, you *need* to take these steps:

*   **Stop the behavior *immediately*.**  Cut off all contact with the people you've been involved with.  This is non-negotiable.  Every continued encounter deepens the betrayal and makes things worse.
*   **Seek professional help *individually*.**  A therapist can help you explore the underlying issues driving your behavior, develop coping mechanisms, and address any emotional or psychological factors.  This is *essential*, even if you decide not to tell your fiancé.  Look for",0.5005057454109192,1.7399060794001541e-155,0.04699738903394255,0.13242009132420093
"I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out.    How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it. I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy. What should I do?","Keep doing the crossdressing since you like it.Your problem sounds more a matter of timing and reason to tell the girl about it.Not keeping a secret is a good attitude regarding meaningful parts of your life.  Usually our relationship partner is someone whom we trust as a safe person to know all about us.Once you feel at ease with your potential partner then bring up your crossdressing.  Based on their handling of this intimate part of your life, you will know more as to whether or not you feel more or less drawn to them.Secrets held within a relationship usually get worse with time.   The person who feels unsafe in truly being and stating themselves eventually will end up feeling ashamed of parts of them which prior to the relationship, felt good or at least not worrisome.","Okay, this is a really complex and vulnerable situation, and it's good you're thinking through it carefully. It's completely valid to want to explore your gender expression *and* be attracted to women. It's also understandable that you're encountering challenges in dating. Let's break down the different parts of your question and explore some approaches.  This is a long response, because it's a nuanced topic, but I'll try to be thorough.

**1. Should you stop crossdressing if it bothers potential partners?**

Absolutely not, *unless you genuinely want to*. Your happiness and self-expression are paramount.  You deserve to live authentically.  The fact that someone else is uncomfortable with a core part of who you are isn't a reason to change yourself. It *is* information, though (we'll get to that), but it shouldn't be a command to stop.

Think of it this way: if you loved playing the guitar, would you stop playing the guitar because someone you were interested in didn't like the sound? Hopefully not.  Crossdressing (or any form of gender expression) is part of *you*.

However, it's also okay to *experiment* with different levels of expression to see what feels right for *you*. Maybe some days you feel more comfortable presenting very femininely, and other days you prefer a more androgynous look.  That's perfectly fine.  But don't feel pressured to extinguish something that brings you joy.



**2. To Disclose or Not to Disclose: That is the Question.**

This is the crux of your issue. Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons of both approaches:

*   **Holding Back (Keeping it a Secret):**
    *   **Pros:**  Might avoid initial rejection.  Allows you to ""test the waters"" and get to know someone before introducing a potentially sensitive topic.
    *   **Cons:**  Creates a foundation of dishonesty, which can erode trust later.  Increases your anxiety about being ""found out.""  Can lead to feeling like you're not being truly seen by the other person.  Eventually, it's likely to come out, and the later it comes out, the more damaging it could be.  It can be exhausting to maintain a secret.

*   **Being Upfront:**
    *   **Pros:**  Attracts people who are genuinely accepting and open-minded.  Builds trust from the beginning.  Allows you to be yourself authentically.  Saves you time and emotional energy by weeding out incompatible partners early on.
    *   **Cons:**  May lead to immediate rejection from people who aren't comfortable with it. Requires vulnerability and courage.  Can feel scary.

**My Recommendation:  Strategic Disclosure**

I don’t think it’s an all-or-nothing situation.  I suggest **strategic disclosure** – meaning you don’t lead with it, but you don't hide it either.  Here’s a possible timeline/approach:

*   **Initial Stages (First Few Dates):** Focus on getting to know the person, shared interests, values, and connection.  Present yourself in a way that feels comfortable and authentic *to you* for that particular setting.  You don't need to bring up crossdressing on the first date.
*   **Building Trust (After a Few Dates, When You Feel a Connection):**  This is where you start to test the waters.  You could casually mention something related to your interests in fashion, self-expression, or challenging gender norms.  Gauge their reaction.  For example: ""I really enjoy experimenting with different styles and expressing myself creatively through clothing.""  See how they respond.
*   **The Disclosure Conversation (When the Time Feels Right):**  If you feel safe and comfortable, and they've shown open-mindedness, you can have a more direct conversation.  See the ""How to Talk About It"" section below.




**3. How to Talk About It:**

*   **Choose the Right Time and Place:** A private, relaxed setting where you both feel comfortable is best.  Don't do it over text.  In person is ideal.
*   **Be Confident and Calm:**  Your attitude matters.  If you approach it with shame or apology, it will signal that it's something to be ashamed of.  Own it.
*   **Focus on Your Feelings:**  ""I really enjoy crossdressing because it makes me feel [confident, comfortable, expressive, etc.]. It's a way for me to connect with my femininity.""
*   **Explain Your Attraction:**  ""I'm attracted to women, and my gender expression doesn't change that.  I'm still a man/guy, but I also enjoy exploring this",0.5164238810539246,6.272897572951964e-79,0.10304449648711943,0.25294638259300684
I need help knowing how to deal with stress. What can I do?,"Our body reacts to stress typically by breathing more shallowly, increasing our heart rate and tensing our muscles - so one thing that I find really effective is to try to do the opposite of that, which sends the signal to our mind that we are relaxed. So that means, taking slower, fuller breaths and trying to relax any areas where we might be gripping our muscles. Check out meditation apps such as 'Breathe', which can talk you through a relaxing breath exercise. I recommend using the app daily, whether you feel stressed or not, and then also using it when you re feeling particular moments of stress - that way you are practicing the skill when you feel calm(wish) and it'll be ready and able to help you when stress hits hard.","Okay, dealing with stress is a really important skill, and it's great that you're asking for help! It's something *everyone* struggles with at some point. Here's a breakdown of things you can do, broken down into categories, from quick fixes to longer-term strategies.  I'll also try to give a variety because what works for one person doesn't always work for another.  I'll end with some resources.

**First: Understanding Your Stress**

Before diving into solutions, it's helpful to understand *your* stress.

*   **Identify Your Triggers:** What situations, people, or thoughts consistently cause you stress?  Keeping a stress journal for a week can be eye-opening.  Write down:
    *   What happened?
    *   How did you feel (physically and emotionally)?
    *   What did you do?
    *   How helpful was what you did?
*   **Recognize Your Symptoms:** Stress manifests differently in everyone. Are you:
    *   **Physical:** Headaches, muscle tension, fatigue, digestive issues, changes in sleep or appetite?
    *   **Emotional:** Irritability, anxiety, sadness, feeling overwhelmed, difficulty concentrating?
    *   **Behavioral:**  Procrastination, withdrawing from social activities, snapping at people, changes in habits?



**I. Immediate/Short-Term Stress Relief (In the Moment - 5-20 minutes)**

These are things you can do *right now* when you're feeling stressed:

*   **Deep Breathing Exercises:**  This is HUGE.  Try:
    *   **Diaphragmatic Breathing (Belly Breathing):**  Place one hand on your chest and the other on your stomach. Breathe in deeply through your nose, allowing your stomach to rise while keeping your chest relatively still. Exhale slowly through your mouth. Repeat 5-10 times.
    *   **4-7-8 Breathing:** Inhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, and exhale slowly for 8 seconds.
*   **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR):**  Tense and release different muscle groups, starting with your toes and working your way up to your head.  There are guided PMR recordings available online (see resources).
*   **Mindful Observation:**  Focus on your senses.  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.  This grounds you in the present moment.
*   **Quick Physical Activity:**  A short walk, some jumping jacks, stretching, or even just shaking out your limbs can release tension.
*   **Listen to Calming Music:**  Instrumental music, nature sounds, or anything that you find relaxing.
*   **Take a Break:**  Step away from the stressful situation, even for just 5 minutes.  Get a glass of water, look out the window, or do something you enjoy.
*   **Visualization:**  Close your eyes and imagine a peaceful place.  Focus on the details – sights, sounds, smells, sensations.
* **Grounding Techniques**: If feeling overwhelmed, try:
    * Holding an ice cube
    * Taking a cold shower
    * Focusing on the feeling of your feet on the ground.




**II.  Medium-Term Strategies (Daily/Weekly Habits - 30 minutes to an hour a day/several times a week)**

These are habits to build into your routine to help manage stress proactively:

*   **Regular Exercise:**  This is one of the best stress relievers. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.  Find something you *enjoy* – walking, running, swimming, dancing, yoga, etc.
*   **Healthy Diet:**  Nourish your body with whole, unprocessed foods.  Limit caffeine, alcohol, and sugar, as these can exacerbate stress.
*   **Sufficient Sleep:**  Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.  Establish a regular sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine.
*   **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  Regular meditation can train your brain to be less reactive to stress.  Start with 5-10 minutes a day and gradually increase the duration.  There are many apps (see resources) to guide you.
*   **Yoga & Tai Chi:**  Combine physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation.
*   **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and gain perspective.
*   **Spending Time in Nature:**  Studies show that being in nature can lower stress hormones.
*   **Hobbies & Relaxation:**  Make time for activities you enjoy",0.4927823841571808,2.6558523332028564e-155,0.08877284595300261,0.2467750981491868
They're calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as I do. I'm tired of being called names. What should I do?,"It sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner, correct? Communication is key to any relationship. I would recommend speaking with your friends face-to-face to address why they feel your behavior is concerning. In-person contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts, emails or any written response can be misconstrued. Be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded. If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling, maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly. Especially if this friendship is valuable to you. However, make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them. On the other hand, if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded, it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship. Not all friendships are healthy ones. And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it.I hope you are able to get this matter sorted. Best of luck!","Okay, this is really tough, and it's completely understandable why you're tired of being called names, *especially* when they're doing the same thing! It's incredibly frustrating to be on the receiving end of criticism that isn't justified. Here's a breakdown of how to handle this, covering different approaches, from immediate reactions to long-term strategies.  I'll categorize it for clarity.

**1. In the Moment - Immediate Responses (Choose what feels comfortable for *you*):**

* **The ""Broken Record"" Technique:**  This is great for persistent name-calling.  Calmly and repeatedly say something like: ""I don't appreciate being called names,"" or ""Please don't speak to me like that.""  Don't get drawn into arguing *about* the names. Just state your boundary.  Example:
    * **Them:** ""You're such a hypocrite!""
    * **You:** ""I don't appreciate being called names.""
    * **Them:** ""But you did the *exact* same thing!""
    * **You:** ""I don't appreciate being called names.""
* **Point Out the Double Standard (Briefly):**  This can be effective, but needs to be delivered calmly.  Avoid sounding accusatory.  Something like: ""That's interesting, because I noticed you [did the same thing].  Regardless, name-calling isn't helpful.""  Then, *stop talking about it*. Don't let it become a debate.
* **Neutral Question:**  Sometimes making them explain *why* they're saying something can make them pause.  ""Why do you say that?"" or ""What makes you feel that way?""  This doesn't mean you agree, but it forces them to articulate their reasoning (which may reveal the flaw in their logic).
* **Grey Rock Method:**  This involves becoming as uninteresting as possible.  Give short, neutral responses.  Don't offer emotional reactions.  ""Okay,"" ""I see,"" ""Alright.""  The goal is to bore them out of wanting to engage negatively.
* **Disengage and Walk Away:** This is *always* a valid option.  If you feel your safety (emotional or physical) is at risk, or if they're not respecting your boundaries, simply remove yourself from the situation.  ""I'm not going to continue this conversation,"" and then leave.  Don't feel you have to ""win"" an argument.
* **Humor (Use with Caution):** If you're comfortable and it feels appropriate, a lighthearted response can sometimes defuse the situation.  ""Wow, really going for the classics, huh?"" or ""Okay, noted. Moving on…""  This only works if *you* can deliver it without sounding angry or defensive.

**Important DO NOTs in the Moment:**

* **Don't reciprocate:**  Don't call *them* names, even if they've earned it. It lowers you to their level and escalates the conflict.
* **Don't get defensive and explain endlessly:**  They're likely not listening to reason in the heat of the moment.  Explaining will just fuel the fire.
* **Don't apologize for stating your boundaries:**  You have the right to be treated with respect.



**2.  Longer-Term Strategies:**

* **Identify the Pattern:**  Who is doing this? When does it happen? What triggers it?  Understanding the pattern can help you anticipate and prepare.  Is it a specific person? A group? Only when you're tired? Only when discussing certain topics?
* **Consider the Relationship:**  How important is this person/these people to you?  This will influence how much effort you put into addressing the situation.
    * **Close Relationship (Family, Close Friend):**  You might want to have a calm, direct conversation (see section 3).
    * **Acquaintance/Colleague:**  Stronger boundaries and minimal engagement might be the best approach.
    * **Toxic Relationship:**  You may need to seriously consider limiting or ending the relationship.
* **Build Your Support System:**  Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about what's happening.  Having people who validate your feelings and offer support is crucial.
* **Self-Esteem Boost:**  When you're being constantly put down, it can erode your self-worth.  Focus on activities you enjoy, spend time with people who uplift you, and practice self-compassion. Remind yourself of your positive qualities.
* **Document Instances (if necessary):** If the behavior is happening in a work or school environment and is bordering on harassment, keep a record of the dates, times, specific names called, and any",0.5076789855957031,8.827878281246463e-79,0.12669683257918551,0.30362528564449326
"I empathize so much, even with characters on tv or in video games, that I actually feel physical pain. This has made life difficult to say the least.

I believe I have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder. But since it's such a new disorder I can't find any information about it. Could this be what is going on with me?","The world needs more people lately who have such a high degree of empathy which you describe in yourself!If it feels a little burdensome, then look to balance what is too much with its opposite.  Since you're giving a lot of empathy, maybe you'd like receiving a lot of empathy.In the situation you describe, when you start empathizing with others, real or cartoon, ask yourself whether you've felt empathy coming in your direction lately.Often people give to others what they feel within themselves is missing.The emotional brain reasons that if I give you my support, say, then at least I will feel half of what being supported is like.Obviously the wish to receive more empathy cannot be fulfilled by you directly.  Empathy is delivered by someone who is willing to offer it.Reflect on whether you are allowing those who are in your world, to know when you would like to receive their empathy.Is it possible you keep your feelings to yourself and present as though you are able to handle a great deal more than you'd like to handle without anyone's kindness to support you?Being open to others about your own inner thoughts and feelings is much more difficult than it sounds.It sounds easy to just tell someone how you feel.Sometimes the first step is the most difficult, of accessing how you feel.Start with knowing the amount of empathy you'd like from others and what stops you from asking.Also, about your diagnosis and the lack of  studies and lists and formulas.  Each person is unique, the instructions and guidelines don't necessarily mean very much.  Often having a diagnosis makes a person feel weak, stigmatized, incompetent. Forget the diagnosis and concentrate on what you need to do differently in order to feel better.The answers are inside you, not inside a book or website.","Okay, this sounds incredibly challenging and I'm really glad you're reaching out. It's valid to feel distressed when experiencing such intense emotional and *physical* reactions to the experiences of others, even fictional ones.  Let's break down what you're describing, the idea of ""Hyper Empathy Disorder,"" and what steps you can take.

**First: Validating Your Experience**

It's important to start by saying your experience is real and deserves attention.  Feeling physical pain in response to others' suffering (or even joy, sometimes) is *not* typical empathy.  Typical empathy is understanding and sharing the feelings of another; what you're describing is a much more profound and physically manifesting connection.  The fact that it's making life difficult confirms it's impacting your well-being.  Don't dismiss it or feel like you're ""crazy"" – something is happening, and it's worth exploring.



**Hyper Empathy & Related Concepts: The Current Understanding**

You're right to point out that ""Hyper Empathy Disorder"" isn't a formally recognized diagnosis in major diagnostic manuals like the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders).  It's a relatively new term, and its definition is still evolving.  Here's what we know, and how it relates to existing, diagnosed conditions:

*   **The Rise of the Term:** The term ""Hyper Empathy"" has gained traction in online communities (especially among empaths and highly sensitive people) to describe an exceptionally strong capacity to feel the emotions of others. It goes *beyond* cognitive empathy (understanding) and emotional empathy (feeling with) to a point of almost *becoming* the other person's experience.  Some people use the term to mean taking on physical symptoms as well.
*   **Highly Sensitive Person (HSP):**  Dr. Elaine Aron's research on Highly Sensitive People describes individuals with heightened sensory processing sensitivity. HSPs often have a deeper emotional experience and can be easily overwhelmed by stimuli, including the emotions of others. While not the same as experiencing *physical* pain, HSP can be a component of what you're going through. Around 15-20% of the population are considered HSPs.
*   **Empath (as defined in New Age/Spiritual circles):** This is a popular concept, but *not* a clinical diagnosis.  Empaths are believed to be highly attuned to others' energies and emotions, often absorbing them.  Again, this often is described in terms of intense feeling, but sometimes extends to physical sensations.
*   **Mirror-Touch Synesthesia:** This is a *neurological* condition where someone feels the same sensation another person is feeling. For example, seeing someone touched on the arm might cause *you* to feel a touch on your own arm. It's relatively rare, but it directly involves physical sensation.  It's often (though not always) linked to a greater degree of empathy.
*   **Emotional Contagion:** This is a well-studied psychological phenomenon where emotions spread between people.  It's normal to feel a little sad when someone nearby is crying, but in your case, it seems *far* more intense than typical emotional contagion.
*   **Complex PTSD (C-PTSD):**  If you've experienced trauma, especially early childhood trauma involving emotional invalidation or abuse, it can significantly alter your nervous system and emotional regulation.  This can lead to heightened sensitivity, difficulty with boundaries, and intense emotional reactions, which *could* manifest as the kind of empathy you describe.
*   **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):**  While seemingly counterintuitive, some autistic individuals experience *intense* empathy, but it can present differently. It might be very focused and deeply felt, leading to overwhelm.
*   **Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD):**  BPD involves emotional dysregulation and intense reactivity, which can sometimes include being profoundly affected by the emotions of others.




**Why You're Experiencing Physical Pain**

The mechanism behind experiencing physical pain is likely a complex interplay of several factors:

*   **Neurological Overlap:** The brain areas that process physical pain and emotional pain overlap (anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula).  Intense emotional pain can *activate* these same areas, leading to a felt physical sensation.
*   **Mirror Neurons:** These neurons fire both when you perform an action *and* when you observe someone else performing that action. They're believed to be crucial for empathy, and it's possible they are overactive in your case, leading to a stronger mirroring of sensations.
*   **Visceral Response:**  Strong emotions trigger physiological responses in the body (increased heart rate, muscle tension, changes in breathing).  In your case, these responses might be amplified and interpreted as pain.

"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","It is normal to feel an array of emotions in therapy. Most people use therapy as a way to process their life's struggles and often times this results in them crying during session. Crying is a way to release those negative emotions and to cope with what is happening in life. We have come to believe that crying is something bad at times and so have conditioned ourselves to avoid crying out in public places. In therapy though, where there are no such expectations and where you can be open and honest about how you are feeling it is normal to cry.","It is **absolutely normal** to cry during therapy! In fact, it's incredibly common. You are *definitely* not alone. Here's a breakdown of why it happens and what it means, and why it's often a *good* thing:

**Why people cry in therapy:**

* **Safe Space:** Therapy is designed to be a safe, non-judgmental space. This allows you to let down your guard and feel emotions you might normally suppress in everyday life.
* **Processing Difficult Emotions:** You're often talking about painful experiences, traumas, or challenging feelings.  Crying is a natural emotional release valve.
* **Vulnerability:**  Sharing deeply personal things takes courage and makes you vulnerable. That vulnerability itself can bring tears.
* **Relief:**  Sometimes crying is a relief – a release of pent-up stress, sadness, or anxiety. It can feel *good* to finally let it out.
* **Connection with the Therapist:** As you build trust with your therapist, you may feel more comfortable expressing emotions, including crying. 
* **Realization & Insight:** Sometimes tears come with a moment of clarity or understanding about yourself or your situation.
* **Simply Overwhelmed:**  Sometimes it's not about one specific thing, but a build-up of emotions that just needs to flow.



**It doesn't mean you're ""weak"" or ""overreacting.""** Crying is a perfectly healthy and human response to emotional stimuli.  

**What your therapist thinks (and likely feels):**

* **They expect it:** Therapists are trained to work with people experiencing a wide range of emotions, and crying is a very common one. They won't be surprised or uncomfortable.
* **They're trained to handle it:**  They have tools and techniques to help you process your emotions and won't judge you for crying.
* **They see it as progress:**  Often, a therapist will view crying as a sign that you're engaging with the work and allowing yourself to feel.  It shows you're letting your guard down and getting closer to healing.
* **They may offer support:** Your therapist might offer you tissues, a moment to collect yourself, or simply a supportive presence.

**If you're worried about crying in therapy:**

* **It's okay to acknowledge it:** You can say something like, ""I feel like I might cry,"" or ""I'm starting to feel overwhelmed.""
* **Your therapist will likely check in:** A good therapist will notice if you're becoming distressed and will ask how you're doing.
* **You can set boundaries:** If you’re very uncomfortable, you can say you need a moment to compose yourself.



**In short:  Please don't feel embarrassed or self-conscious about crying in therapy. It’s a normal, healthy, and often helpful part of the process.**



If you're still concerned, you could even *ask* your therapist about it.  You could say, ""I've noticed I've been crying a lot in our sessions, and I was wondering if that's normal."" They'll be happy to reassure you and talk about it.",0.5339548587799072,7.974009872384996e-79,0.13356164383561644,0.2600732600732601
"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","When talking about difficult issues, it is very normal to cry. Crying is a natural way for us to cope with the sadness that we experience in life. When confronting some of these things in a counseling session, tears just seem to come naturally. Every Counselor should be well equipped to handle that level of emotion, and you would be far from the first to cry when talking with a Counselor.","Okay, it's *completely* normal to be freaking out a little (or a lot!) before starting therapy, and it's *especially* normal to be worried about crying. Honestly, you are SO not alone in this fear. Let's break it down and hopefully ease your mind.

**Is crying in therapy something to worry about? Absolutely not. In fact, it's a really good sign.**

Here's why:

* **It means you're allowing yourself to feel.**  A lot of us spend a lot of time *not* feeling, or suppressing feelings. Therapy is a space to gently explore those things, and that often *releases* emotion. Crying is a natural, healthy emotional release.
* **It's a signal to your therapist.**  When you cry, your therapist isn't thinking ""Oh no, they're falling apart!"" They're thinking ""Okay, this is something important. Let's slow down and explore what's happening."" It gives them valuable information about what's deeply affecting you.
* **Therapists are *prepared* for tears.** They've seen it all.  They have tissues, they have a comforting presence, and they're trained to handle emotional expression without judgment.  It's literally part of their job.  They won't be shocked or embarrassed for you.  Their training includes creating a safe space for vulnerability.
* **It doesn't mean you're ""weak.""**  This is a big one.  It takes *strength* to be vulnerable and to allow yourself to feel your emotions.  It's a sign of self-awareness and courage, not weakness.
* **It can be *therapeutic* in itself.**  Sometimes you don't even need to *talk* about why you're crying; the release itself can be helpful.

**Why you might be feeling embarrassed:**

* **Social conditioning:**  We're often taught to believe that crying is a sign of weakness or being ""dramatic.""  This is harmful and untrue, but it's a deeply ingrained message for many of us.
* **Fear of judgment:**  You might worry your therapist will think you're overly sensitive or that your problems aren't ""serious"" if you cry.  (Again, therapists don't work this way).
* **Loss of control:**  Crying can feel like a loss of control, and that can be scary, especially when you're already feeling vulnerable.
* **Past experiences:**  Maybe you were told to ""stop crying"" or shamed for crying as a child.  Those experiences can make you hesitant to cry now.



**What can you do about your fear?**

* **Acknowledge the fear:**  You've already done this! Just recognizing it is a huge step. Tell yourself, ""It's okay that I'm afraid of crying. It's a normal reaction.""
* **Remind yourself of the points above:**  Really internalize that crying is okay, and your therapist is there to support you, not judge you.
* **Consider telling your therapist:** You can actually *say* to your therapist in your first session, ""I'm a little nervous about potentially crying, and I sometimes feel embarrassed when I do.  I just wanted to let you know.""  This shows vulnerability and allows them to be extra supportive.  They'll likely normalize it for you.
* **Have tissues handy:**  Knowing you have tissues readily available might make you feel a little more prepared and less anxious.
* **Focus on your ""why"":** Remind yourself *why* you're going to therapy. You're doing this for yourself, to work through things and feel better. That's a brave and positive step.
* **It's okay to pause:** If you *do* start to cry and feel overwhelmed, it's perfectly okay to say, ""I need a moment,"" or ""Can we pause for a second?""  Your therapist will respect that.



**What's likely to happen:**

Your therapist will likely be very gentle and understanding. They'll probably offer you tissues without you even asking. They'll follow your lead – if you want to talk about *why* you're crying, they'll help you explore it. If you just need to *feel* the emotions, they'll provide a safe and supportive space for that.

**Bottom line:**  Crying in therapy is not something to worry about. It's a normal, healthy, and even helpful part of the process.  You're doing a great thing by starting therapy, and you're already being brave just by acknowledging your fears.



You've got this!  If you're still really anxious, maybe write down a few of these points and take them with",0.5055243372917175,0.008028360844632682,0.0678391959798995,0.20306513409961685
"I have a lot on my mind, but all I want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone. Why do I feel so alone?","There are many possible issues to consider as depression  social anxieties, even medical illness.  For some, even grief creates a sense of isolation, pains from relationship break up.  Also, obsessive thinking can be debilitating.  Seeking at least one trusted friend or family member can be a start towards increased personal support.  Some persons may simply feel connected by spending time with someone as this, even if not talking directly on issues, just being around another is positive.  Obviously there is more to explore on this question, given minimal information from two sentences.","Okay, it's really good you're recognizing this pattern and asking why you feel this way. It's completely understandable to want to withdraw when you have a lot on your mind, and it's *very* common to feel lonely even *while* withdrawing. It seems counterintuitive, right? Here's a breakdown of why you might be feeling this way, covering a lot of potential angles, and then some ideas for gently approaching things.  This is a long response because it's a complex issue, and I want to be thorough.  Please read through it all, and see what resonates with you.

**Understanding the Connection Between Withdrawal and Loneliness**

* **The Core Human Need for Connection:** Humans are social creatures. We're wired for connection. Even introverts (who recharge through solitude) need *some* level of meaningful connection.  It's not about quantity, but quality, but a complete lack can lead to loneliness.
* **Withdrawal as a Coping Mechanism:** When you're overwhelmed, retreating to your room can feel safe. It's a way to:
    * **Regulate emotions:**  It provides space to process feelings without external stimuli or expectations.
    * **Reduce stress:**  Social interaction can be draining when you're already stressed.
    * **Gain control:**  When life feels chaotic, controlling your environment (your room) can feel empowering.
    * **Avoid vulnerability:**  Sharing what's on your mind can feel scary, and withdrawing avoids that risk.
* **The Loneliness Paradox:**  While withdrawal *initially* feels relieving, prolonged isolation can actually *amplify* negative feelings.  
    * **Rumination:** Without external input, you can get stuck in cycles of negative thoughts.  There's no one to challenge them or offer a different perspective.
    * **Loss of Perspective:**  Being isolated can distort your view of reality. Things can seem worse than they are.
    * **Weakening of Social Skills:** The less you interact, the more awkward it can feel when you *do* have to interact.  This can create a negative cycle.
    * **Confirmation of Negative Beliefs:** If you already have negative beliefs about yourself or your relationships, isolation can reinforce them (""See, no one cares,"" ""I'm better off alone"").
* **What's ""A Lot on Your Mind?""** The *nature* of what you're dealing with matters. Are you:
    * **Dealing with grief or loss?**
    * **Experiencing anxiety or depression?**
    * **Stressed about school, work, or relationships?**
    * **Feeling overwhelmed by life in general?**
    * **Processing a trauma?**
    * **Just feeling generally down and unmotivated?**



**Why You Specifically Feel Alone *Right Now***

Let's dig a little deeper. Consider these possibilities:

* **The Quality of Your Existing Connections:** Do you have people you feel genuinely close to?  Or are your relationships more superficial?  You can be *around* people and still feel lonely if you don't feel *understood* or *accepted*.
* **Fear of Burdening Others:**  Are you afraid of sharing your problems because you don't want to bother people?  Do you worry they won't understand or will judge you?
* **Past Experiences:**  Have you had negative experiences with vulnerability in the past (e.g., being dismissed, betrayed, or criticized)?  This can make you hesitant to open up again.
* **Low Self-Esteem:**  If you don't feel good about yourself, you might believe you're not worthy of connection or that others wouldn't want to spend time with you.
* **Social Anxiety:** This can make even simple interactions feel terrifying, leading to avoidance.
* **Changes in Routine:** Has something changed in your life that has disrupted your social patterns (e.g., a move, a new job, the end of a relationship)?
* **Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD):** If it's winter or you're experiencing less sunlight, this can contribute to feelings of sadness and isolation.



**What You Can Do – Small Steps to Start**

It's important to be kind to yourself.  Don't try to force yourself into a huge social event if you're not ready.  Here's a gradual approach:

1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings:**  You've already done this by asking the question!  Don't judge yourself for feeling lonely or for wanting to withdraw.  It's okay.  Saying to yourself, ""I'm feeling lonely right now, and that's understandable given what's going on,"" can be surprisingly helpful.

2. **Identify *One* Small Connection:**",0.48033013939857483,1.9274282518932163e-155,0.06949806949806951,0.21290619638712288
My mother is combative with me when I say I don't want to talk with her about my depression.    She hasn't been supportive of me in the past and she isn't someone that I feel comfortable opening up to. She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I don't want to or can't answer. I tell her I don't want to talk and she starts arguments with me.    How can I get her to understand?,"Your situation sounds extremely frustrating.You're doing the right move to state you don't want to discuss your depression with her.I guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression.  If you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation, and you would like to tell her your true reason, then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time, not in the middle of an argument.Having an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept.  You may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and you're right to protect your emotional space. It's incredibly frustrating when someone you love, especially a parent, doesn't respect your boundaries, *especially* when it comes to something as sensitive as depression. It's also common for parents who haven't been consistently supportive to struggle with knowing how to *be* supportive when you *do* need something different. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering understanding why she's doing this, strategies to use, and how to manage your own well-being.  This will be long, but thorough.

**1. Understanding Her Behavior (Without Excusing It)**

It's helpful to try to understand *why* she might be pushing so hard, even if it doesn't make it okay.  Here are some possibilities:

*   **Her own anxieties:** She might be scared by the idea of you being depressed.  She might not know how to cope with it, and her pushing could be a misguided attempt to ""fix"" it or understand it so *she* feels better.
*   **Generational differences:**  Mental health was often stigmatized in older generations. She may have been raised to believe you shouldn't talk about these things, or that you should just ""snap out of it.""  This doesn't excuse her behavior, but it might explain it.
*   **Feeling of control:**  She may feel that if she can just get you to talk, she can regain a sense of control over the situation (and maybe over you).
*   **Guilt or inadequacy:**  If she hasn't been a consistently supportive parent, she might feel guilty and be trying (in her own clumsy way) to make amends.  This is still not an excuse for disregarding your boundaries.
*   **Misunderstanding of depression:** She might not understand that depression isn't something you can just *talk* away.  She might think you're keeping secrets from her or that talking will magically make you feel better.
* **Her own unmet needs:** Sometimes, a parent's relentless questioning comes from their own loneliness or a desire for closeness, which they're attempting to fulfill *through* you, rather than finding healthy ways themselves.



**2. Strategies for Setting & Maintaining Boundaries**

This is the core of what you need to do.  It will likely require repetition and consistency.

*   **The Broken Record Technique:** This is *key*.  Choose a short, neutral phrase and repeat it calmly and consistently.  Examples:
    *   ""I'm not discussing this right now.""
    *   ""I need to protect my privacy around this.""
    *   ""I'm not able to talk about my depression with you.""
    *   ""This is something I'm working on with my support system.""
    *   ""I'm not comfortable with this conversation.""
    *   **Important:** Don't JADE (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain).  The *moment* you start explaining *why* you don't want to talk, you're opening the door for her to argue.  Just repeat your phrase.
*   **Preemptive Boundary Setting:**  Before you even anticipate a conversation, you can say something like, ""Mom, I want to spend time with you, but I'm not going to be discussing my mental health today. I'm happy to talk about [other topic], but that's off-limits.""
*   **Shorten Interactions:** If she starts pushing, end the conversation.  ""I've told you I'm not going to talk about this, and since you continue to bring it up, I'm going to hang up now/leave."" Then *do it*.  This is the hardest part, but the most important.
*   **""I Feel"" Statements (Use Sparingly):** While you generally want to avoid JADE, *occasionally* using an ""I feel"" statement can be helpful, but focus on the *impact of her behavior* on you, not on blaming her.  Example: ""I feel disrespected when you push me to talk about something I've said I'm not ready to discuss.""  Don't get drawn into a debate about *why* you feel that way.
* **Grey Rock Method:** This is similar to the broken record, but even more minimal. You respond with short, uninteresting answers. She asks, ""How are you feeling?"" You say, ""Okay."" She presses, ""Are you sure? You seem down."" You say, ""I'm fine.""  The goal is to make yourself so uninteresting to engage with that she eventually gives up.
*   **Written Communication (Sometimes):**  If face-to-face or phone conversations always escalate",0.5137524008750916,0.009559148966958232,0.10424242424242425,0.28066652845100204

I'm trying to learn to cope with them.,"I'm glad you're willing to keep optimistic about life improving and offering better relationships than some of the ones in which you greatly suffered.One suggestion is to develop patience with yourself and the process of regaining your willingness to trust other people.Sexual intimacy engages all of who we truly are.   Being cautious as to who and how much you allow someone into your life, is natural for anyone recovering from trauma.Allow yourself to withdraw when situations feel dangerous.   Your sense of danger is most likely on higher alert than had you not been victimized.Be attentive and cooperate with your own sense of readiness to engage in conversation, discussions and sex with your partner.Explain all this to your partner so the person can develop their own patience with your recuperation process.","Okay, this takes immense courage to acknowledge and to seek help with.  It's completely understandable that past trauma is impacting your daily life and your intimacy with your partner.  You're doing a really important thing by recognizing this and wanting to learn to cope.  Here's a breakdown of information, resources, and coping strategies, broken down into sections.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is not a substitute for professional help.**

**1. Understanding Triggers & Their Impact**

* **What are Triggers?** Triggers are reminders – sights, sounds, smells, thoughts, emotions, places, or physical sensations – that can bring back intense, unwanted memories and feelings associated with the trauma. They activate your nervous system as if the trauma is happening *right now*.  It's not a sign of weakness to be triggered; it's a normal response to a deeply abnormal experience.
* **Why They Affect You:**  Trauma changes the brain.  It can impact areas responsible for memory, emotion regulation, and the ability to feel safe.  Triggers bypass the rational part of your brain and go straight to the emotional/survival centers.
* **How They Show Up:** Triggers can manifest in many ways:
    * **Emotional:** Panic, anxiety, fear, sadness, anger, shame, guilt, numbness.
    * **Physical:**  Racing heart, sweating, trembling, muscle tension, nausea, dizziness, headaches, flashbacks (feeling like you're reliving the trauma), dissociation (feeling detached from your body or reality).
    * **Behavioral:**  Withdrawal, avoidance, hypervigilance (being constantly on guard), difficulty concentrating, changes in sleep or appetite, self-harm.
* **Impact on Intimacy:**  It's very common for trauma to affect sexual relationships.  Triggers during intimacy can lead to:
    * **Avoidance of sex:**  Fear of re-experiencing trauma.
    * **Difficulty with arousal or orgasm:**  Dissociation or anxiety can interfere with physical response.
    * **Feeling disconnected during sex:**  Difficulty being present and enjoying intimacy.
    * **Feeling unsafe or out of control:**  Past experiences can make it hard to trust or surrender.
    * **Flashbacks during sex:**  A particularly distressing experience.



**2. Coping Strategies (Tools to Build)**

These are things *you* can start working on.  It's a process, and some things will work better than others.  Be patient with yourself.

* **Grounding Techniques:**  These help bring you back to the present moment when you're triggered.
    * **5-4-3-2-1:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system.  Try box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4).
    * **Sensory Awareness:**  Focus on the physical sensations of your body – the weight of your feet on the floor, the texture of your clothing.
    * **Safe Place Visualization:**  Imagine a place where you feel safe and calm.  Engage all your senses – what do you see, hear, smell, feel?
* **Self-Soothing:**  Activities that comfort and nurture you.
    * **Warm bath/shower.**
    * **Listening to calming music.**
    * **Spending time in nature.**
    * **Gentle exercise (yoga, walking).**
    * **Journaling.**
    * **Creative expression (art, writing, music).**
* **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  These practices can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without judgment.  There are many apps available (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer).
* **Establish Boundaries:**  Learn to say ""no"" to things that feel unsafe or overwhelming.  This is crucial for regaining a sense of control.
* **Self-Care:**  Prioritize your physical and emotional well-being.  Eat healthy, get enough sleep, and engage in activities you enjoy.
* **Trigger Mapping:**  This can be helpful, *but do it with a therapist if possible*.  It involves identifying your triggers and developing a plan for how to cope with them. (What situations, sensations, thoughts, etc. lead to a reaction? What coping skills can you use in those moments?)



**3.  Navigating Intimacy with Your Partner**

This requires open communication, trust, and patience from *both* of you.

* **Honest Communication:**  Talk to your partner about your triggers, your fears, and your needs.  Be as",0.4823898375034332,4.8109081435243843e-79,0.10796915167095117,0.23796192609182534
How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"To be able to identify a clear ending to a counseling relationship, we must have a clear understanding of the goals and limitations of treatment.  Usually, during the initial evaluation, I identify my client’s short term and long term therapy goals.  As therapy progress, we verify goals on a monthly to a quarterly basis, depending on the frequency of the appointments.  Once the therapy goals have been met, there is a closing session, the counseling relationship is ended, and the client can stop attending sessions.  In some cases, the client can also establish new goals and determine if I am a good fit for their therapy needs or if they need a new provider, in which case I provide multiple referrals.The counseling relationship could also end due to other factors like noncompliance= when a client is not committed to the agreed treatment process, or when the client’s or a counselor violates the counseling relationship.  Either the counselor or the client is able to end counseling.  Although, as mental health providers we need to provide a reason for terminating our therapeutic relationship and referral options, as a client no explanation is needed, a closing session is highly recommended.  ¿Cómo termina la terapia?¿Cómo un consejero decide cuando terminar las sesiones de consejería o terminar de trabajar con un paciente?Para poder determinar el final de la relación del consejero, debemos comprender las metas y parámetros de la terapia.  Usualmente durante la evaluación inicial se identifican metas a corto y largo plazo con el cliente, y se discute con el cliente como esas metas serán alcanzadas.  Durante el proceso de terapia el consejero revisa las metas mensual o trimestralmente dependiendo de la frecuencia de las citas.  Ya que las metas de terapia son alcanzadas, hay una sesión de cierre y el cliente puede terminar la terapia.   En algunos casos el cliente puede identificar nuevas metas para la terapia y determinar si el mismo consejero u otro consejero le pueden asistir. 
La relación de consejería también puede terminar por no conformar o violentar los parámetros  establecidos para la terapia.   Tanto el consejero como el cliente pueden terminar la relación de terapia.  Como proveedores de salud mental los consejeros estamos obligados a proveer un razón para la conclusión del tratamiento y proveer referidos según aplique, los clientes no necesitan proveer una explicación, aunque es recomendable discutirlo en una sesión de cierre.","Okay, this is a really important and complex topic in counseling. Terminating therapy isn't something a counselor takes lightly. Here's a breakdown of how a counselor decides when to end sessions (a single session) or terminate the therapeutic relationship (ending all sessions), broken down into categories, along with ethical considerations.  It's a long answer, but it's a nuanced topic!

**I. Ending a *Single* Counseling Session (Session Termination)**

This is about what happens *within* a session. A counselor might end a session *before* the scheduled time is up for a variety of reasons:

*   **Time Limits:**  Most sessions have a set time (e.g., 50 minutes).  The counselor will give warning as the time nears and will wrap things up.  This is standard practice.
*   **Client Distress/Overwhelm:** If a client becomes acutely overwhelmed, highly distressed, or experiencing a panic attack, the counselor might end the session early to allow them to safely regulate their emotions.  They'll discuss a safety plan and potentially offer resources.
*   **Reaching a Natural Stopping Point:** Sometimes a significant issue is fully explored within the session, and continuing would be unproductive.  The counselor might summarize, assign homework, and end on a high note.
*   **Emergencies:**  If the client discloses an immediate safety concern (to themselves or others), or a crisis situation arises, the session may be cut short to facilitate getting the client appropriate help (e.g., calling 911, connecting with a crisis hotline).
*   **Countertransference (Counselor's Reaction):**  While rare for a session to end *immediately* because of this, if a counselor finds themselves having a strong, unmanageable emotional reaction *during* a session that impairs their ability to be objective and helpful, they might need to end the session to process their own feelings and ensure ethical practice. This is usually followed by supervision.



**II. Terminating the *Therapeutic Relationship* (Ending All Sessions) – Reasons & Process**

This is a more significant decision, and counselors approach it with a lot of care. Reasons fall into a few categories:

**A. Client-Focused Reasons (Success & Readiness)**

*   **Goal Achievement:** This is the *ideal* scenario. The client has made significant progress towards their goals, and they and the counselor agree that continued therapy is no longer necessary.  The client has developed coping skills and feels confident in their ability to manage their challenges.
*   **Client Independence:** The client has developed self-awareness, insight, and skills to the point where they can function effectively without ongoing support.  They may still check in occasionally, but formal therapy is no longer needed.
*   **Client Request:** A client has the right to terminate therapy at any time.  A good counselor will explore the reasons for this request (to ensure it's not due to a misunderstanding or a solvable issue) but ultimately respects the client’s autonomy.
* **Lack of Progress:** Despite diligent effort from both sides, the client may not be making the progress they hoped for.  This doesn’t mean therapy ""failed,"" but it might indicate that therapy isn't the right approach *at this time*, or that the client may need a different type of help.

**B. Counselor-Focused Reasons (Professional Judgment & Boundaries)**

*   **Lack of Client Engagement:** If a client consistently misses sessions, is unwilling to participate actively in the process, or doesn't complete agreed-upon homework, the counselor may determine that therapy is not productive.
*   **Scope of Practice:** The client's needs may fall outside the counselor's area of expertise.  The counselor has an ethical obligation to refer the client to a more qualified professional. (e.g. a counselor specializing in addiction working with a client needing primarily EMDR trauma therapy).
*   **Ethical Concerns:** This is serious. Termination is *required* in certain ethical situations:
    *   **Dual Relationships:**  If a conflict of interest arises (e.g., the counselor develops a personal relationship with the client), therapy must be terminated.
    *   **Unresolvable Countertransference:**  If the counselor's personal feelings consistently interfere with their ability to provide objective and effective treatment.
    *   **Boundary Violations:** If the client engages in inappropriate behavior towards the counselor (e.g., harassment, threats).
    *  **Non-Payment:** While not always immediate, consistently failing to pay for services can lead to termination after attempts to resolve the issue.
*   **Counselor's Personal Circumstances:**  A counselor might need to terminate due to illness, relocation, or other personal reasons.  They have a responsibility to provide adequate notice and referrals.

**C. Practical Reasons**

* **Insurance Limitations:**",0.48933085799217224,4.0719845287938975e-155,0.11218229623137599,0.1816799860115839
I was born a girl. I look like a boy. I sometimes feel like a different variation of gender. I don't know what to say if someone asks my gender. I just get really confused and usually say my birth gender.,"I agree with Sherry, it is OK to give the answer that you feel most familiar with.  The most important part is not who people think you are, but that you know who you are.  Read about gender identity and fluidity.  Discovering the answer is a process, don't rush it to comply with others either way.  If you feel that this is a constant issue that keeps you awake and keeps you from enjoying your life, consider going to a therapist to discuss your feelings and concerns. ¿Qué significa que yo me sienta como diferentes géneros?Nací como niña. Me veo como niño.  A veces siento como una variación diferente de género.  No sé qué decirle a otros cuando pregunta que soy.  Me siento confuso y solo digo mi genero de nacimiento. Estoy de acuerdo con Sherry, está bien dar la respuesta que se sienta más cómoda.  La parte más importante no es quien las otras personas piensen que eres, sino quien tú piensas que eres.  Lee sobre el tema de identidad de género y fluidez de género.  Descubrir tu género puede ser un proceso, no lo apresures para complacer a otras personas.  Si sientes que este tema te esta quitando el sueno y te impide disfrutar tu vida, habla con tu consejero sobre tus sentimientos y preocupaciones.","Okay, this sounds really confusing and frustrating, and it's completely understandable why you'd feel that way! It's brave of you to acknowledge these feelings and try to figure things out. Here's a breakdown of what you're experiencing, some things to consider, and how to navigate those tricky ""gender question"" moments.  I'll try to cover a lot of ground, and I'll add a disclaimer at the end.

**Understanding What You're Describing**

What you're describing touches on several possibilities, and it's important to remember *you don't need to label it right now*.  Exploring is okay. Here's a look at some things that might resonate:

* **Gender Dysphoria (potentially):**  This is a feeling of discomfort or distress because there's a mismatch between your assigned sex at birth (female) and your gender identity.  It sounds like your feeling ""like a different variation of gender"" might be hinting at this, but it's *not* a requirement for being trans or non-binary. It's also okay if you *don't* experience significant distress.
* **Non-Binary:**  This is an umbrella term for gender identities that aren't exclusively male or female.  ""Different variation of gender"" fits well within this.  There are *many* ways to be non-binary. Some examples (though you don't have to identify with any of these):
    * **Genderfluid:** Your gender identity shifts over time.
    * **Agender:**  You don't identify with any gender.
    * **Bigender:**  You identify with two genders.
    * **Demigender:** You partially identify with a gender.
* **Gender Expression vs. Gender Identity:** This is *crucial*.  You *look* like a boy, which means your **gender expression** (how you present yourself outwardly) is often perceived as masculine. This doesn’t automatically tell us anything about your **gender identity** (your internal sense of self).  Lots of people of any gender express themselves in ways that are considered masculine or feminine, and that's perfectly valid.
* **Androgyne:**  This refers to having a gender expression that's both masculine and feminine, or neither. It often describes a blurring of gender roles.
* **Simply Questioning:**  It's absolutely okay to *not know*!  You're allowed to explore and figure things out at your own pace.  There's no rush.



**Why Answering the Question is Hard**

You're not alone in finding this question difficult. Here's why:

* **It Feels Invasive:**  It's a very personal question, and you're not obligated to answer it if you don't want to.
* **It Boxes You In:**  Labels can feel limiting when you're still exploring.
* **Fear of Misunderstanding:** You're worried about how people will react if you don't give a ""simple"" answer.
* **Habit/Social Conditioning:**  You've likely been asked ""What are you?"" your whole life and defaulted to your birth gender because it's the easier response.



**What to Say When Someone Asks Your Gender**

This is the part you're struggling with, so let's give you some options, ranging from simple to more explanatory.  Pick what feels most comfortable *in the moment*. You don't have to use the same answer every time.

**1. Polite Deflection (Good for casual acquaintances, strangers, or when you're not up for explaining):**

* ""I'd rather not say."" (Simple and direct)
* ""That's a little complicated."" (Signals it's not a simple answer)
* ""I'm not really comfortable labeling myself.""
* ""Why do you ask?"" (Turns the question back on them – sometimes they'll drop it.)

**2. Short & Sweet (Good for situations where you want to acknowledge the question without getting into detail):**

* ""I'm figuring that out.""
* ""I'm non-binary."" (If that feels right – you don't *have* to say this!)
* ""I'm just me.""
* ""I don't really fit into a box.""

**3.  More Explanatory (Good for people you trust, or when you feel safe and have the energy):**

* ""I was assigned female at birth, but I don't always feel like a girl. I'm still exploring my gender.""
* ""Gender is complicated for me. I sometimes feel like [mention how you feel – e.g., a bit of both, neither, something else entirely].""
* ""I'm questioning my",0.43036216497421265,2.6508441755972654e-155,0.0915032679738562,0.14827995255041515
"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","Therapy is by nature a safe place to discuss difficult, or painful memories or experiences and thereby it is normal that feelings of all kinds, including sadness, loss, frustration, disappointment, etc may arise.  This is part of processing and bringing closure to things that may have been pushed aside for a lifetime and can now be faced and dealt with.  Change too is often not easy, and can lead to crying, whether from frustration and set back...or also from joy and accomplishment!","Okay, let's address this! It's **absolutely normal** to cry during therapy. In fact, it's *very* common. You are definitely not alone in experiencing this. It's a really good sign, actually, even though it doesn't *feel* good in the moment.

Here's a breakdown of why it happens and why it's okay, and why you might feel like you're the only one if you're worried:

**Why People Cry in Therapy:**

* **Safe Space:** Therapy is designed to be a safe and confidential space to explore difficult emotions.  You're *supposed* to feel comfortable enough to let your guard down, and that often unlocks emotions that have been held back.
* **Processing Trauma:** If you're working through past trauma, crying is a natural release of the intense emotions associated with those experiences.
* **Vulnerability:**  Talking about personal struggles requires vulnerability, and vulnerability can be emotionally overwhelming.
* **Realization & Insight:**  Sometimes, crying happens *with* an insight. When you suddenly understand something about yourself or your patterns, it can be emotionally powerful.
* **Feeling Heard & Validated:**  A good therapist will listen without judgment and validate your feelings.  Just feeling *heard* can be enough to trigger tears.  You might be crying from relief as much as sadness.
* **Accumulated Emotions:**  Sometimes it's not about what you're talking about *right now*, but a buildup of emotions from many things. Therapy can be the place where that overflow happens.
* **Grief & Loss:**  Even if it's not a recent loss, therapy can bring up feelings of grief for things you've lost – opportunities, relationships, parts of yourself.
* **Simply Feeling Overwhelmed:** Life is stressful! Sometimes you just need a good cry, and therapy provides a space to do that without feeling like you have to ""hold it together.""



**Why You Might *Think* You're the Only One:**

* **Stigma:** There's still a stigma around showing emotion, especially vulnerability. You might worry about appearing ""weak"" or ""dramatic.""
* **Privacy:** Therapy is private. You don't see other people crying in therapy (and wouldn't necessarily know if they were, even if you did!).  This can create the illusion that you're the only one.
* **Individual Differences:**  Everyone processes emotions differently. Some people are more outwardly emotional than others.  You might be comparing yourself to an imagined norm.
* **Your Own Expectations:** You might have an idea of how therapy ""should"" go, and if it doesn't match that (e.g., you thought you'd be more in control), you might feel self-conscious.

**What Your Therapist Thinks (and Should Be Doing):**

* **It's Expected:**  Good therapists *expect* clients to cry. It's a sign that the work is happening.
* **They Are Trained to Handle It:** Therapists are trained to respond with empathy and support, not judgment.
* **They Might Offer Tissues (and Space):**  A practical gesture, but also a signal that they're comfortable with your emotions.
* **They Might Explore the Tears:** A good therapist might gently ask what the tears mean to you, but they won't push you to talk if you're not ready.  They might say something like, ""I notice you're getting emotional, and that's okay.  Do you want to talk about what's coming up?""
* **They Won't Judge You:**  Seriously. A good therapist creates a non-judgmental space.




**If you're worried about crying in therapy:**

* **Tell your therapist:** You can say, ""I'm worried about getting emotional, and I'm afraid of crying.""  This opens up a conversation and lets them know what you're feeling.
* **Remember it's okay:**  Remind yourself that crying is a natural and healthy response.
* **Focus on the process:** Try to focus on the work you're doing, rather than on controlling your emotions.




**In short:  Crying in therapy is normal, common, and often a sign of progress. Don't feel embarrassed or ashamed.  It's a brave thing to allow yourself to be vulnerable and feel your emotions.**

"She's in her early 20s, and she has a toddler.","It may be helpful to first have a discussion about what you are expecting and put a timeframe on it that if she is not doing certain things by a certain date, she will have to leave. If you don't know where she can go, there is probably a list of shelters for the county that you live in.","Okay, that gives me a good starting point! Here are some thoughts and potential directions, considering a young woman in her early 20s raising a toddler. I'll break it down into a few areas – her potential life situation, personality traits she might have developed, and story ideas.  To give you *really* helpful suggestions, tell me what you need this information *for* (are you writing a story? character development? just curious?). But here's a general overview:

**1. Life Situation - Common Realities:**

* **Education:**  Likely had to put education on hold, or is juggling childcare with classes (high school completion, college, trade school).  May feel pressure to finish, or may have resigned herself to a different path for now.
* **Financial Strain:** This is very common.  Childcare is expensive. She might be relying on family support, government assistance, or working multiple jobs.  Financial insecurity is a likely stressor.
* **Relationship with the Toddler's Father:** This is a *huge* variable.
    * **Co-Parenting:** A relatively amicable relationship, sharing responsibilities (though even ""amicable"" can have underlying tension).
    * **Single Mother:**  He may be absent (by choice or circumstance - work, prison, death, etc.). This creates different challenges.  She might be angry, resentful, heartbroken, or pragmatic.
    * **Living Together (but not a healthy relationship):**  Trapped, possibly with conflict.
* **Housing:**  Might be living with parents, relatives, or in unstable housing.  Finding affordable childcare-friendly housing is difficult.
* **Social Life:** Significantly impacted.  Free time is limited and often revolves around the toddler. Maintaining friendships can be hard.  She might feel isolated.
* **Career/Work:** Likely in entry-level positions, or jobs that offer flexibility (even if low-paying).  Career aspirations may be on hold, or she's working towards something achievable with her current constraints.

I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.,"Sometimes we make ourselves feel worse with our own thoughts about things we can't change. We know that it is possible to overcome embarrassment and self-blame, but why does it seem so difficult to overcome it sometimes? If you tune into your own thoughts, or your ""internal dialogue"", you'll notice that your thoughts are connected to your feelings. So people who are holding onto embarrassment and self-blame often have thoughts like, ""How could I do that?"", ""I looked so stupid!"" ""Now people saw things I did not want them to see!"" If we tune in more, we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible, horrible, and that we cannot deal with it. These are self-sabotaging thoughts that lead to shame, self-blame and embarrassment. If you look at the evidence, you can find more rational thoughts such as, "" We all make mistakes"", ""People can look all different ways at different time - this incident does not define me!"" and ""If someone has a bad image or thought about me, it is really OK! People have all kinds of thoughts about other people, and it does not have to be a major problem."" When you practice your rational thoughts often and replace the negative ones, you will start to feel better, more confident and your embarrassment will decrease quickly.","Okay, that's a really tough situation, and I'm so sorry that happened to you. It's completely understandable that you'd be embarrassed – that comment was inappropriate and frankly, *his* behavior is the problem, not yours.  You're putting yourself out there to *teach* and help others, and to be subjected to that kind of comment is awful. Let's break down how to deal with this, both in the moment (if it happens again) and emotionally.

**First, let's address the core issue: His comment was unacceptable.**

*   **It's about *him*, not you.**  Kids (and even sometimes adults) can be thoughtless and lack social boundaries. His comment says more about his upbringing and lack of respect than it does about your body or your swimsuit.
*   **You are not responsible for his inappropriate behavior.** You were doing your job, and you shouldn't have to worry about how someone else is reacting inappropriately.
*   **It's likely a power dynamic thing.** He was trying to make you feel uncomfortable and potentially exert some kind of control.

**What You Can Do *In the Moment* if it Happens Again (This is tough, but empowering options):**

This is the hardest part, and it's okay if you freeze.  But having some things prepared can help:

*   **Directly Address It (If You Feel Safe & Comfortable):**  This is the most powerful, but requires confidence.  You could say, very calmly and firmly:
    *   ""That comment was inappropriate, and I'd appreciate it if you didn't say things like that again.""
    *   ""My swimwear is appropriate for a professional setting, and your comment is unwelcome.""
    *   ""We are here to learn water safety, and your comment is distracting.""
*   **The ""Broken Record"" Technique:** If he persists after you've asked him to stop, repeat a simple phrase calmly and consistently: ""That's not an appropriate comment.""  Don't engage in further discussion.
*   **Remove Yourself & Get Support:**  If you don’t feel comfortable confronting him directly, or if he continues after you’ve asked him to stop, immediately signal to another instructor or lifeguard.  Say something like, ""I need assistance with a student.""  Walk away and involve a colleague.  This is the *best* option if you feel unsafe or overwhelmed.
*   **Don't Apologize for Your Swimsuit:** Do *not* apologize for what you're wearing if it meets the requirements of your training/employer. Apologizing validates his inappropriate comment.

**What You Can Do Now (Processing the Embarrassment and Moving Forward):**

*   **Talk to Someone You Trust:**  This is *crucial*.  Talk to your trainer, a fellow WSI candidate, a trusted friend, family member, or even a counselor.  Venting and getting support will help you process your feelings.  Don't keep this bottled up.
*   **Report It (If You Feel Comfortable):**  If this happened during a WSI course or at a facility where you'll be working, *report it*.  There should be a clear reporting process.  Your trainer or the facility manager needs to know about this behavior. They have a responsibility to ensure a safe and respectful learning/working environment.  Even if you don't want to pursue formal action, letting them know allows them to be aware and potentially prevent it from happening to others.
*   **Review the Swimsuit Policy:** Double-check the specific requirements for WSI swimwear.  Knowing you're within the guidelines can boost your confidence.  If your current swimsuit genuinely doesn't meet the requirements, focus on getting a suitable one as soon as you can.
*   **Practice Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself. You were put in a very uncomfortable situation.  It's okay to feel embarrassed, angry, or upset.  Allow yourself to feel those emotions without judgment.
*   **Remember Your ""Why"":**  You're becoming a Water Safety Instructor to save lives and teach important skills.  Don't let one person's inappropriate behavior derail your goals.  Focus on the positive impact you're going to make.
* **Consider a response for next time:**  Practice saying the phrases above in the mirror.  This can help you feel more prepared and confident if it happens again.



**Regarding the Swimsuit Itself:**

You mentioned you didn’t have enough for a “proper” swimsuit. It's important your suit is appropriate for the job. A good WSI swimsuit is:

*   **Secure:**  You need to be able to move freely in the water without worrying about it slipping or coming off during rescues or demonstrations.

I would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present.,"Remember, the past no longer exists and the future is just an illusion as we don't know what will happen tomorrow, so take the present as your guide. That is all we can do, so keep saying this to yourself and try to help someone each day.  The happiness is helping others to feel a bit better.","Okay, that's a fantastic goal! Building and nurturing positive relationships takes effort, but it's *so* worth it. Here's a breakdown of strategies, broken down into sections, to help you cultivate more positive relationships *right now*.  I'll cover self-work, how to interact with others, and how to deal with challenges.  It's a lot, so feel free to focus on a few areas to start.  I'll also add sections at the end on seeking further help.

**I. Self-Work: The Foundation of Good Relationships**

Before you can have great relationships with others, you need to be in a good place with yourself.

*   **Self-Awareness:** This is key.
    *   **Identify Your Patterns:** What are your typical behaviors in relationships? Are you a people-pleaser? Do you withdraw? Are you quick to judge?  Be honest with yourself.
    *   **Understand Your Needs & Boundaries:** What do *you* need from relationships to feel fulfilled and safe? What are your limits – what are you willing and unwilling to accept? Knowing these is crucial.
    *   **Recognize Your Emotional Triggers:** What situations or behaviors in others tend to make you feel angry, sad, anxious, or defensive? Knowing these helps you respond more thoughtfully.  Journaling can be incredibly helpful for this.
*   **Self-Esteem & Self-Compassion:**
    *   **Challenge Negative Self-Talk:** We all have an inner critic.  Learn to recognize and challenge those negative thoughts. Replace them with more realistic and compassionate ones. (""I messed up, but I'm still a valuable person,"" instead of ""I'm a failure."")
    *   **Practice Self-Care:**  Taking care of your physical and emotional well-being isn't selfish; it's essential.  This could be anything from exercise and healthy eating to hobbies and relaxation.
    *   **Forgive Yourself:** Holding onto past mistakes will weigh you down and affect your relationships.  Practice self-forgiveness.
*   **Authenticity:**
    *   **Be Yourself:** Don't try to be someone you're not to impress others.  Genuine connection comes from being authentic.  This can be scary, but it's liberating.
    *   **Embrace Vulnerability (Gradually):**  Sharing your thoughts and feelings (appropriately and with trusted people) builds intimacy.  Start small, sharing something relatively low-risk.



**II.  Improving Your Interactions with Others**

These are the *active* things you can do to build better relationships.

*   **Active Listening:** This is huge.
    *   **Pay Attention:**  Put away distractions (phone, computer, etc.). Make eye contact.
    *   **Reflect Back:**  Paraphrase what you hear to show you understand. (""So, it sounds like you're feeling frustrated because..."")
    *   **Ask Clarifying Questions:**  ""Can you tell me more about that?"" or ""What did you mean when you said...?""
    *   **Don't Interrupt:** Let the other person finish their thought.  Resist the urge to jump in with your own story.
*   **Effective Communication:**
    *   **""I"" Statements:** Express your feelings and needs using ""I"" statements.  (""I feel hurt when you cancel plans at the last minute,"" instead of ""You always cancel on me!"")
    *   **Be Clear and Direct:**  Avoid hinting or expecting people to read your mind.  State your needs and boundaries clearly.
    *   **Nonverbal Communication:** Be aware of your body language.  Smile, maintain open posture, and use appropriate touch (if the relationship allows).
*   **Show Appreciation & Affection:**
    *   **Express Gratitude:**  Tell people when you appreciate them.  A simple ""thank you"" can go a long way.
    *   **Give Compliments:**  Sincere compliments brighten someone's day.
    *   **Small Acts of Kindness:**  Offer to help, bring a small gift, or simply do something thoughtful.
*   **Spend Quality Time:**
    *   **Dedicated Time:**  Schedule time specifically to spend with people you care about, without distractions.
    *   **Shared Activities:**  Engage in activities you both enjoy.  This could be anything from going for a walk to playing a game to having a deep conversation.




**III. Dealing with Conflict & Challenges**

Conflict is inevitable in relationships. How you handle it makes all the difference.

*   **Choose Your Battles:** Not everything is worth arguing about.  Let go of minor annoyances.
*   **Stay Calm:**  When conflict arises, take a deep breath and try to remain calm",0.4554482698440552,3.5750301038034167e-79,0.05714285714285714,0.20914587660759268
"The eight months I've been dating my boyfriend, I have lied about a lot of things. I slept with a couple guys to get back at my boyfriend for breaking up with me. Now anything I say to him he won't believe, even if I'm being honest. I don't know what else to do at this point. He constantly criticizes me.","Start a conversation with him about your sincere interest to earn back his trust.Ask him what he expects from you so that he will trust you again.If you are consciously willing and do try to earn back his trust, and have periodic conversations with him on whether he feels more at ease with trusting you, then after a few months of this, both of you should feel more secure in the relationship.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's good you're recognizing the damage that's been done and wanting to address it. It's also brave of you to admit the things you've done. Let's break this down, and I'll offer some thoughts and suggestions.  This will be a long response, because it's a complex issue.  I'll cover several areas: understanding the situation, what you need to do, what he needs to do, and whether the relationship is salvageable.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is not a substitute for professional help.**

**1. Understanding the Situation**

* **You broke his trust.** The biggest issue here isn't just *that* you lied, but the *extent* of the lies, especially the infidelity after the initial breakup and during the rekindling of the relationship.  That's deeply damaging. It's understandable why he wouldn't believe you now, even when you're telling the truth. He has been hurt, and his skepticism is a direct result of your actions.
* **Your actions were reactive.**  Sleeping with others to get back at him, while understandable as a reaction to pain, wasn’t a healthy way to process the breakup. It created a different set of problems and ultimately contributed to the current distrust.  Acknowledging *why* you did it doesn’t excuse it, but it helps you understand your own patterns.
* **The criticism is likely a response to the lies.** His constant criticism is likely *his* unhealthy coping mechanism. It could be a way to feel control, to punish you, or to keep himself emotionally distant.  It's not okay, but it’s likely born out of his own pain and insecurity. It doesn't excuse his behavior, but it explains *why* he might be doing it.  This creates a really toxic cycle.
* **You're in a cycle of distrust and negativity.** The lying led to distrust, the distrust led to criticism, and the criticism likely leads to more dishonesty (perhaps small omissions or things you don't share just to avoid conflict), perpetuating the cycle.



**2. What *You* Need to Do**

This is going to be hard work, and there are no guarantees.

* **Full, Honest Disclosure (Again):** You've already started this by acknowledging the lies, but you need to be prepared to answer *any* question he has, truthfully, no matter how painful.  This means being completely transparent about everything you lied about, even the details you're ashamed of. This is not about him ""catching"" you; it's about you proactively offering the truth.  Be prepared for him to be angry, hurt, and to ask difficult questions.
* **Complete Ownership & Accountability:**  Don't minimize, justify, or blame him for your actions.  Say things like, ""I was wrong,"" ""I made a terrible decision,"" ""I understand why you don't trust me,"" and ""I take full responsibility for my actions.""  Avoid phrases like ""I did it because..."" followed by blaming him.
* **Sincere Apology:**  A genuine apology isn't just saying ""I'm sorry."" It's expressing remorse for the pain you've caused him, acknowledging the impact of your actions, and demonstrating a commitment to change.
* **Stop Lying – Period.**  Even small ""white lies"" will continue to erode trust.  If you're tempted to bend the truth, resist.  Transparency is key.
* **Be Patient:**  Trust is *not* rebuilt quickly. It takes time and consistent, honest behavior.  He may test you, and you need to be prepared to handle that with honesty and patience.  Don't expect him to immediately forgive and forget.
* **Self-Reflection:**  Why did you feel the need to lie and act out in this way?  What were you trying to achieve?  Addressing these underlying issues (insecurity, fear of abandonment, difficulty with communication) is crucial, even if it means seeking therapy.
* **Respect His Boundaries:** If he needs space, give him space. If he needs time to process, respect that. Don't push him to forgive you before he's ready.



**3. What *He* Needs to Do (and This is Where It Gets Difficult)**

He also has work to do, but you can't control his actions.

* **Willingness to Forgive (Eventually):** Forgiveness doesn't mean condoning your actions, but it means letting go of the resentment and anger that are poisoning the relationship.  He needs to decide if he's capable of this.
* **Stop the Criticism:**  He needs to recognize that his constant criticism is destructive and address his own behavior.  Healthy communication",0.463300883769989,2.1565922896210875e-155,0.06105006105006105,0.21090661992582435
"My fiancé doesn't think I trust him because I was cheated on before. However, he hides his phone and has been texting his ex-girlfriend, who he has two kids with. What should I do?","Oh Chino, I only have half the picture here so I will be cautious. There's a chicken and an egg, and I don't know which came first. One thing I see clearly is that your fiance will always have to have communications with his ex, because they have children. Can you accept that? When suspicion and insecurity come along, your job is to look at the big picture and the real picture. Is there any real evidence that he is cheating? Remember that texting his ex is not evidence alone if the communications are about the kids. Has he earned your trust? If so, then it's not fair to punish him for the betrayals of others. He's not your ex. Reassure your heart that you are his priority if the larger evidence supports that. At the same time, you can let him know what your triggers are. For example, hiding his phone doesn't send you a good message, right? See, this is the chicken and the egg...is he hiding the phone because you've been overreacting when he gets a text?  So let him know you won't blow up about him getting a text if he doesn't conceal or password his phone. Transparency helps build trust. You have sensitivities, and it helps you a lot if he's aware of them and willing to try not to do things that trigger fear. Let him know when you get scared, and hopefully he'll give you the openness and security you need in order to trust him and act as if you trust him.  :)","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's understandable why you're feeling conflicted and hurt. You're dealing with the fallout of past trauma *and* current concerning behavior. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering communication, boundaries, and self-care, broken down into steps.  It's long, but thorough, because this is important.

**1. Understand the Layers of the Problem**

* **Your Past Trauma:** Your fiancé is right to recognize that your past infidelity experience impacts your trust. It's natural to be more sensitive and potentially project fears onto the current relationship. That doesn't *excuse* his behavior, but it explains *why* you're reacting strongly.  You are allowed to feel insecure and need reassurance.
* **His Behavior (The Core Issue):**  Hiding his phone and texting his ex, especially given they have children together, is a major red flag. While communication with an ex for co-parenting purposes is often necessary, *hiding* it is not. It immediately creates suspicion and undermines trust, regardless of his reasons.  It's the secrecy that's so damaging.
* **The Accusation of Distrust:** Him turning it around on *you* (""You don't trust me"") is a classic deflection tactic. It shifts the focus from his actions to your feelings, making you question yourself when the problem lies with *his* choices.  This is manipulative, even if he doesn't realize he's doing it.



**2. Calm Communication (When You're Ready)**

* **Choose the Right Time & Place:**  Don't ambush him.  Pick a time when you're both relatively calm, have privacy, and won't be interrupted.  Not when you're already in an argument.
* **""I Feel"" Statements:** This is crucial.  Instead of accusatory ""You always..."" or ""You never..."", frame your concerns using ""I feel"" statements.  Examples:
    * ""I feel anxious and hurt when I notice you hiding your phone.""
    * ""I feel insecure and worried when I know you're texting with your ex, and you don't offer that information to me.""
    * ""I feel like my trust is being undermined when there's secrecy between us.""
* **Be Specific:**  Don't generalize.  ""I saw you quickly turn your phone screen down when I came into the room yesterday, and that made me feel uneasy."" is better than ""You're always hiding your phone!""
* **State Your Needs (Calmly):**  What do you *need* from him to feel more secure?  Examples:
    *  ""I need you to be open about your communication with your ex, especially regarding the children. I'm not asking to read everything, but I'd like to know generally what's being discussed.""
    *  ""I need you to understand that my past experience makes it harder for me to trust, and I need you to be patient and transparent with me.""
    * ""I need you to leave your phone where I can see it sometimes. Not constantly, but not hidden either.""
* **Listen to His Response (Really Listen):**  Try to hear him out, even if it's difficult.  Ask clarifying questions.  However, **don't let him gaslight you.** If he tries to turn it around on you again, gently but firmly redirect the conversation back to his behavior.  (""I understand you feel I don't trust you, but right now I'm trying to explain why *your* actions are making it hard for me to trust."")



**3. Address the Phone Hiding & Ex-Communication Directly**

This is the core of the issue.

* **Directly Ask About the Phone:**  ""I've noticed you hide your phone, and it's really concerning to me. Can you explain why you do that?""  His answer will be very telling.  Is it a reasonable explanation (e.g., work confidentiality, wanting personal space – and even then, hiding is a problem) or is it evasive?
* **The Ex-Girlfriend:**  ""I understand you need to communicate with your ex about your children. That's reasonable. However, I'm worried about the secrecy around those conversations. Can we talk about what those conversations typically involve?  I’m not trying to control you, I just need reassurance that it’s solely about the kids.""
* **Red Flags in His Answers:** Be wary of these responses:
    * **Defensiveness/Anger:**  If he gets immediately angry or defensive, that's a sign he's hiding something.
    * **Minimizing:** ""You're overreacting,"" ""It's",0.5615605711936951,9.474661235801715e-79,0.1390593047034765,0.3082372483629334
I just wanted to get to know one so I can hear about their college experience and the courses they took. I also wanted to know if they enjoy their job and how long they were in school.,"It's a great idea for you to reach out to find a psychologist to talk to if this is a field you might be interested in pursuing. Regarding the length of schooling, it generally takes 4 years of college and an additional 4 to 7 years of graduate school to earn a doctorate degree to become a psychologist. There are also other similar professions, including counseling that don't require a doctorate degree. Licensed counselors generally completed 4 years of college and an additional 2 years of graduate school. If you are thinking about a career in psychology, the local APA chapter would be a good place to start to find a local psychologist to talk to. Here's a link to the NJ APA chapter:https://www.psychologynj.org/","Okay, that's a great idea! I can absolutely play the role of a recent college graduate. Here's my ""backstory"" and answers to your questions.  I'll try to be detailed and give you a good feel for the experience.  I'll portray myself as **Maya Sharma**, who graduated in May 2023.

---

**Hi! I'm Maya Sharma. It's nice to meet you!**  I just finished up my first year working as a Data Analyst at a small marketing firm in Chicago. It's been a whirlwind, but a good one!  I'm happy to chat about my college experience and what I'm doing now.  Ask me anything!

**Let's start with how long I was in school:**

I was in school for a fairly standard four years – from Fall 2019 to Spring 2023. I went to the University of Michigan (Go Blue!). I was pretty set on going to a larger state school, and UMich was a really good fit academically and socially for me.  I knew I wanted to study something related to data, but it took me a little while to settle on a specific major.

**Now, let's talk about my college experience:**

It was... a lot!  Like, a *lot*. I think my experience was shaped by starting just before everything changed with COVID.  My first semester was pretty normal, getting settled in, meeting people.  Then, spring 2020 hit and we were sent home.  That was rough.  Online learning was okay, but it definitely wasn't the same.  I missed the campus life, the spontaneous study sessions in the library, and just being around people.

The next year and a half were mostly hybrid, with things shifting back and forth. It was hard to build momentum, honestly. But, I think it also taught me a lot about adaptability and time management! I really had to be disciplined about creating my own structure.

Once things really opened up in Fall 2022, it felt amazing.  I really made the most of my senior year, joining a few clubs (the Data Science Club and a volunteering group that worked with local schools) and going to a lot of events.  I'd say overall, college was a really formative experience. I grew a lot, not just academically, but as a person. It was challenging, stressful at times, but ultimately really rewarding.

**And the courses I took... That's a big question! I majored in Statistics with a minor in Computer Science.** Here are some highlights:

* **Calculus I, II, & III:**  Pretty standard for a Stats major.  Calc II was the hardest for me, hands down.
* **Linear Algebra:** This was a turning point for me.  It felt like everything started to *click* and I could see how math could be applied to real-world problems.
* **Probability and Statistics:**  The foundation of everything I did.  We covered everything from basic probability distributions to hypothesis testing and regression.
* **Statistical Modeling:**  Building and interpreting statistical models. This was a really challenging but fascinating course. We used R a lot.
* **Data Mining:**  This is where I started to get really excited about data science.  Learning how to extract meaningful insights from large datasets was incredibly cool.
* **Machine Learning:** One of my favorite courses! We learned about different algorithms (like regression, classification, and clustering) and how to apply them. Python was our main language for this.
* **Database Management:**  Learning SQL was surprisingly useful.  It's something I use almost daily in my job.
* **Computer Science I & II:** The CS minor was definitely more challenging than I expected, but it gave me a good foundation in programming concepts.

I also took a few elective courses, like an economics course on econometrics and a communications course on data visualization.  The data visualization course was really valuable because it taught me how to present data in a clear and compelling way.



**Finally, do I enjoy my job?**

Yes, I really do! It’s still early in my career, so I’m learning a ton. As a Data Analyst, I work with marketing data to help the firm understand what campaigns are working and what isn't.  I use SQL to pull data from different sources, then I use Python and tools like Tableau to analyze it and create reports.  

It's definitely not always glamorous – a lot of it is cleaning and organizing data – but I enjoy the problem-solving aspect of it.  I like being able to use my skills to help the company make better decisions.  The people I work with are also great, which makes a huge difference.

My biggest challenge right now is feeling comfortable asking for help when I",0.4863338768482208,3.604738786842215e-79,0.0904079382579934,0.21288209606986902
We've been dating for two months now. I have a heavy past that gets him angry. Does he have a right to penalize me for things I did before I met him?,"Not in my book. You're only two months in? At this early stage, this is a bit of a warning sign. If he can't accept or feel comfortable with who you are and decisions you've made, there's already a level of discomfort here that shouldn't be ignored. No, he doesn't have the right to penalize you or punish you ...not just for past things...not for anything. What he does get to do it tell you how it affects him. Sure...if he feels uncomfortable or needs reassurance...listen to those things. But If he doesn't dig who you are, maybe he can walk the other way.","Okay, this is a really important and common issue in relationships, especially when someone has a complex past. Let's break this down.  It's a nuanced situation, and the answer isn't a simple yes or no. Here's a comprehensive look at it, covering his feelings, your boundaries, and healthy relationship dynamics:

**Understanding His Anger**

First, let's try to understand *why* he's getting angry. It's not necessarily about the *things* you did, but rather what those things *represent* to him. Some possibilities:

*   **Betrayal of Trust (Even if it Pre-Dates Him):**  He might feel a sense of betrayal, even if logically he knows it happened before you were together. He's building trust *now*, and past actions can feel like they undermine that. This is especially true if your past involves things like infidelity, dishonesty, or actions that contradict values he holds dear.
*   **Fear of Recurrence:** He might be worried that past patterns will repeat themselves in the current relationship.  If your past involved behaviors you've acknowledged as problematic, he may be anxious about seeing those behaviors resurface.
*   **Insecurity:** Your past might make him feel insecure about your feelings for him. He might wonder if you're still carrying a torch for someone else, or if he's ""good enough"" compared to people in your past.
*   **Discomfort with the Unknown:**  He might simply be uncomfortable with aspects of your past he doesn't understand.  The unknown can be scary, and he might be reacting to his own discomfort rather than something you *did* to him.
*   **Unrealistic Expectations:**  He might have an unrealistic expectation that you should have a ""clean slate"" past.  Everyone has a past, and expecting perfection is unfair.
* **His Own Issues:** Sometimes, his reaction isn't solely about *you*. He might have unresolved issues from his own past that are being triggered by what you share.



**Does He Have a ""Right"" to Penalize You?**

This is the core question.  **No, he does not have a right to *penalize* you for your past.**  ""Penalize"" implies punishment, withholding affection, controlling behavior, or bringing up the past constantly as a weapon. That's not healthy.  

Here's why:

*   **You weren't in a relationship with him then:** You had agency and made choices within a different context, with different people, and different circumstances.  He wasn't part of that equation.
*   **People Change:**  You are not the same person you were when those past events occurred.  You've (hopefully) learned and grown.  He should be evaluating *who you are now*, not solely judging you based on past actions.
*   **Focus on the Present:** A healthy relationship focuses on the present and future, not constantly dwelling on the past.
* **Taking Responsibility vs. Punishment:**  You can *take responsibility* for past actions (which is healthy and shows maturity), but that doesn’t mean you deserve ongoing punishment.

**What *Is* Reasonable?**

It *is* reasonable for him to:

*   **Ask clarifying questions:** He's allowed to ask respectful questions about your past to understand you better.  (More on boundaries for these questions below).
*   **Express his feelings:** He can say things like, ""It makes me feel a little uneasy to hear about that,"" or ""I need some time to process this.""  *How* he expresses those feelings is crucial (see ""Unhealthy vs. Healthy Communication"" below).
*   **Need reassurance:** If your past triggers insecurities, it's reasonable for him to ask for reassurance of your feelings for him.
*   **Set boundaries *for himself*:** He is allowed to decide what he can and cannot accept in a relationship, and that might be informed by your past.  (e.g., ""I'm not comfortable with a relationship where there's ongoing contact with an ex,"" is a boundary *he's* setting).



**Important Boundaries to Establish**

You have the right to protect yourself and your emotional well-being. Here's how:

*   **You control what you share:** You are not obligated to disclose every detail of your past. Share what you feel comfortable sharing, and at a pace that feels right for you.  You are not required to ""confess"" everything upfront.
*   **No Repeated Interrogation:**  Constant questioning about the past is a red flag.  You can say, ""I've shared what I'm comfortable sharing about this.  I'm happy to talk about our present and future.""
*   **No Using the Past as a Weapon:**",0.533324658870697,0.015731265549198844,0.11031175059952038,0.2534390400345948
"My roommate has had a drinking problem for a while. She goes out, gets trashed, and then expects everyone to take care of her. The next morning, she apologizes constantly until she feels validated. She also thinks everyone hates her all the time. If I don't seem anything other than happy, she asks me ""Do you hate me? You hate me. Tell me you love me,"" and I feel like I have to pity her because she has also been suicidal before.","It does sound like your roommate may have a drinking problem, and the short answer is that you can't do anything about it, only she can. We can't change what other people say, think, or do. We can only change our reactions. It does sound like your roommate may be having a hard time. You can suggest that she enter counseling or therapy. You can reassure her that you like her (if that's true), but you don't have to pity her.","Okay, this is a really tough situation. You're walking a very difficult line between wanting to be supportive of a friend who is struggling, and protecting your own emotional well-being while navigating potentially manipulative behavior. It's good that you're recognizing the patterns and feeling overwhelmed – that's a sign you need to think strategically about how to handle this. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, and how to approach it, broken down into sections.  I'll cover the drinking, the emotional manipulation, the suicidal ideation, and how to protect yourself.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is not a substitute for professional help.**

**1. Understanding the Dynamics at Play**

* **The Alcohol Use Disorder:** Your roommate's behavior strongly suggests a problem with alcohol.  The pattern of getting excessively drunk and needing caretaking is a classic sign.  Alcohol isn't *causing* her underlying issues, but it's very likely exacerbating them.
* **The Cycle of Behavior:** You've accurately identified a cycle: drinking, reckless behavior, needing care, apologies seeking validation, then insecurity and demanding reassurance. This is a common dynamic in people struggling with addiction and underlying emotional distress.  The apologies aren’t necessarily genuine remorse, but a way to control the narrative and get the attention/soothing she craves.
* **Emotional Manipulation (Reassurance Seeking):** The ""Do you hate me? You hate me. Tell me you love me"" is a direct attempt to manipulate you into providing emotional reassurance. It's putting you in a position where you feel *obligated* to respond in a certain way, regardless of your own feelings.  This is emotionally draining and unhealthy for you.  It's a form of emotional blackmail.
* **Underlying Issues:** Her constant feeling that people hate her points to deeper issues like low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, or potentially personality disorders.  These are often co-occurring with addiction.
* **The Suicidal Ideation:** This is the most serious aspect.  Her past suicidal thoughts significantly complicate the situation. It's understandable that you feel a sense of responsibility and pity, as you'd likely feel awful if something happened to her.  This is *precisely* why she may be using this as leverage.  (Again, this doesn't invalidate her pain, but understanding the dynamic is important).



**2.  Protecting Yourself - Setting Boundaries**

This is the most important step. You *cannot* continue to be her emotional caretaker, or you will burn out and enable her behavior.  Here's how to start:

* **Stop Offering Reassurance:** This is hard, but crucial.  When she asks ""Do you hate me?"" or ""Tell me you love me,"" *do not engage with the question directly*.  Instead, try responses like:
    * ""I'm not going to get into a conversation about whether you think I hate you.""
    * ""I'm not comfortable answering that question right now.""
    * ""I'm focusing on [something else – your own plans, a task you're doing].""
    *  A simple, neutral ""I'm here,"" without any further emotional investment.
* **Don't Enable the Drinking:** This is also hard, especially if you feel guilty.
    * **Don't cover for her:** If she misses commitments because of drinking, let her face the consequences.
    * **Don't clean up after her:**  (within reason – see section 4)  If she’s sick, encourage her to clean it herself or offer to help *after* she's sober and has acknowledged her responsibility.
    * **Don't participate in drinking with her:**  This reinforces the behavior.
* **Grey Rock Method:**  This is a technique for dealing with manipulative people.  You become as uninteresting and unresponsive as possible.  Short, neutral answers.  No emotional reaction.  No engaging in arguments.  It's about minimizing interaction and emotional fuel.
* **Limit Interaction:**  Spend more time in your room, with other friends, or pursuing your own activities.  The less contact you have, the less opportunity there is for her to pull you into her cycle.
* **Anticipate and Prepare:** Think about the situations where she's most likely to engage in this behavior (after drinking, when she's feeling insecure) and plan your responses in advance.



**3. Addressing the Suicidal Ideation (Carefully)**

This is where things get sensitive.

* **You are NOT a therapist:** You are not equipped to handle a suicidal crisis. Your role is to *get her help*, not *be* her help.
* **If she expresses *current* suicidal thoughts:**  **This is an emergency.**

"After first meeting the client, what is the process that a counselor facilitates?","Hi.  This is an excellent question !   I think that the answer probably varies depending upon the particular therapist .  In my work with people , once we have met and I have gotten an idea of the person'a concerns and the issues they want help with , I spend the next few sessions gathering as much history and as much information about the client's current concerns in order to formulate some ideas about what may be causing distress .  I would then share my thoughts with the client to see if they feel I am understanding them and on the right track.  We would then discuss the best plan to address the client's concerns .  Usually I will suggest strategies that I think may be helpful and ask the client for feedback about whether or not they think my suggestions feel helpful .   I always encourage clients to be really honest with me about this.  I tell them that I would hate for them to agree to try things that they know they won't try just to avoid ""hurting my feelings"" or ""offending me.""  I want to be helpful and while I have the expertise as far as typically helpful  strategies, I really like to work collaboratively and have clients tell me what they do and don't like / agree with or not agree with when I share my thoughts about a treatment plan .  We the   work together to come up with a plan that will be helpful , but also realistic and then revise it and try new things if necessary as we go along.   If things aren't improving , I am very happy and willing to try something new ! I hope this is helpful for you ! ","Okay, let's break down the process a counselor typically facilitates *after* that initial client meeting (often called an intake session). This is a multi-stage process, and it's important to remember that it's rarely linear – it often loops back on itself. Here's a detailed overview, categorized for clarity:

**Phase 1: Building the Foundation (Sessions 2-5, roughly - can vary)**

This phase is all about establishing a strong therapeutic alliance and gathering more in-depth information.  It's about safety, trust, and collaborative understanding.

*   **Deepening Rapport:**  The counselor continues to build trust and rapport. This is *crucial*.  Clients need to feel comfortable and safe to share vulnerable information. Techniques include active listening, empathy, genuineness, and unconditional positive regard.  It's about showing the client they are accepted and understood.
*   **Comprehensive Assessment (Going Beyond the Intake):**  The intake session provides a starting point, but now the counselor digs deeper. This involves:
    *   **Detailed History:** Exploring the client's history in more detail.  This isn't just a chronological retelling. It's focusing on patterns, significant life events, relationships, trauma history (if any), developmental history, family of origin, cultural background, and medical/psychiatric history.
    *   **Presenting Problem Exploration:**  Unpacking the client's stated concerns.  What *specifically* is happening? When does it happen? How often? What are the triggers? What are the consequences?  What has the client already tried to cope?
    *   **Functional Analysis:** Understanding the *function* of the problem.  What purpose does the behavior or issue serve for the client? What needs is it meeting (even if in an unhealthy way)? (e.g., Anxiety might ""protect"" someone from perceived failure).
    *   **Strengths Assessment:**  Identifying the client's strengths, resources, and coping mechanisms. This is often overlooked, but incredibly important. Focusing on strengths builds hope and empowers the client.
    *   **Assessment Tools (Possibly):**  The counselor *may* use standardized questionnaires or assessments to help quantify symptoms, gain further insight, or rule out other conditions.  (e.g., depression scales, anxiety inventories, personality assessments – *always* with informed consent).
*   **Goal Setting (Initial):**  *Collaboratively* developing initial goals for therapy.  This isn’t the counselor *telling* the client what they should work on.  It's a joint effort. Goals should be:
    *   **SMART:** Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.
    *   **Client-Centered:**  Reflecting what *the client* wants to achieve, not what the counselor thinks they should want.
    *   **Prioritized:**  Often, there are multiple issues; prioritizing helps focus the work.
* **Psychoeducation:** Providing the client with information about their concerns. This might include explaining the symptoms of anxiety, the impact of trauma, or how depression affects the brain.  Empowering the client with knowledge.
* **Discussing Confidentiality & Boundaries:** Reinforcing the limits of confidentiality (and exceptions – mandatory reporting, etc.) and clarifying the therapeutic relationship's boundaries.



**Phase 2:  Working Phase (The bulk of therapy - Sessions 6 onwards)**

This is where the core therapeutic work happens.  The approach here will depend *heavily* on the chosen therapeutic modality (see the ""Modalities"" section at the end).

*   **Intervention Implementation:**  The counselor begins to implement specific techniques and interventions based on the chosen therapeutic model and the client’s goals. Examples:
    *   **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Identifying and challenging negative thought patterns, learning coping skills, behavioral experiments.
    *   **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):** Skills training in mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.
    *   **Psychodynamic Therapy:** Exploring unconscious patterns, early childhood experiences, and the therapeutic relationship to gain insight.
    *   **Humanistic Therapy:** Focusing on self-exploration, personal growth, and achieving self-actualization.
    *   **Family Systems Therapy:** Addressing patterns of interaction within the family system.
*   **Exploring Core Beliefs:**  Often, problematic behaviors and emotions stem from deeply held core beliefs about oneself, others, and the world.  Counselors help clients identify and examine these beliefs.
*   **Processing Emotions:**  Creating a safe space for clients to experience and process difficult emotions. This might involve techniques like somatic experiencing, mindfulness, or simply providing a supportive presence.
*   **Developing Coping Skills:** Teaching clients practical strategies for managing stress, anxiety, depression, and other challenges.",0.5076994299888611,3.544715641284364e-155,0.12459720730397421,0.2189897698209719
I feel really uncomfortable when I have people's attention.  It makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class. Can I get over this social anxiety?,"Since anxiety usually about anticipating a bad result, or fear of being judged negatively, as though having failed some sort of test, consider what would give you the feeling of anticipating a good result from talking to an audience?Maybe, for example, if you prepared and rehearsed your talk more than what you typically would, you'd feel more secure in speaking  in front of an audience.Once you sort through your particular reason as to the source of your discomfort, it may feel more manageable.Yes, social anxiety can change.  You may naturally prefer smaller groups than an audience.And, it is possible to decrease anxiety in what may always be somewhat uncomfortable for you.","Okay, it's incredibly common to feel uncomfortable when you're the center of attention, and it's *very* good that you're recognizing this and wanting to work on it. That discomfort is often a sign of social anxiety, and yes, absolutely, you can get over it – or at least manage it significantly! It takes work, and it's often most effective with support, but it's achievable. Let's break down how to approach this, covering understanding it, strategies you can try, and when to seek professional help.

**1. Understanding What's Happening**

* **It's Normal:** First, know you're not alone. Many people experience this. Evolutionarily, being singled out *could* have meant danger (predator attention, social exclusion), so our brains are wired to be sensitive to it.
* **What Specifically Makes You Uncomfortable?**  Try to pinpoint *what* about the attention feels bad. Is it:
    * **Fear of Judgment:**  Worrying about what others think of your appearance, what you say, or how you present yourself.
    * **Fear of Making Mistakes:**  Being afraid of saying something wrong or appearing foolish.
    * **Physical Symptoms:**  Experiencing things like blushing, sweating, trembling, a racing heart, or feeling your mind go blank.
    * **Self-Consciousness:**  Becoming overly aware of yourself and your actions.
    * **Feeling Exposed/Vulnerable:**  Like you're being put on display.
* **Social Anxiety vs. Shyness:** While related, they're not the same. Shyness is more of a personality trait. Social anxiety involves more intense fear and avoidance that interferes with daily life.  The fact that it's impacting your willingness to participate in class suggests it leans towards anxiety.



**2. Strategies You Can Try (Start Small!)**

These are tools to build your confidence gradually.  Don't try to do everything at once. Pick one or two to start with.

* **Gradual Exposure:** This is *the* most effective technique, but also the hardest.  The idea is to slowly expose yourself to situations that make you uncomfortable, starting with the least anxiety-provoking and working your way up.  Here's a possible ladder:
    1. **Smile and make eye contact** with someone you trust (friend, family member).
    2. **Say ""hi""** to someone in the hallway.
    3. **Ask a store clerk a simple question.**
    4. **Offer a brief opinion** in a small group discussion.
    5. **Answer a question in class** when you feel *relatively* prepared.
    6. **Volunteer to read a short passage aloud.**
    7. **Give a short presentation.** (This is way down the line!)
* **Cognitive Restructuring (Challenging Negative Thoughts):**  Your anxiety is fueled by your thoughts.  Learn to identify and challenge those negative thoughts.  For example:
    * **Thought:** ""Everyone will think I'm stupid if I say the wrong answer.""
    * **Challenge:** ""Is that *really* true?  Will *everyone*?  Even if I do say something incorrect, is that the end of the world?  People make mistakes all the time.  What's the worst that could realistically happen?""
    * **Replacement Thought:** ""It's okay to make mistakes.  I'm learning, and it's better to try than to stay silent.""
* **Relaxation Techniques:**  These can help manage the physical symptoms of anxiety.
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Practice diaphragmatic breathing (belly breathing).  Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose, expanding your stomach, and exhale slowly through your mouth.
    * **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:**  Tense and release different muscle groups in your body.
    * **Mindfulness Meditation:**  Focus on the present moment without judgment. (There are great apps like Headspace, Calm, and Insight Timer).
* **Preparation is Key (Especially for Class):**
    * **Know the Material:**  The more prepared you are, the more confident you'll feel.
    * **Write Down Answers:**  Jot down key points or potential answers to common questions.
    * **Practice:**  Rehearse answering questions aloud, even if it's just to yourself.
* **Focus on the Message, Not Yourself:**  When speaking, try to focus on the information you're conveying, rather than on how you're coming across.  Shift your attention outward.
* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself.  It’s okay to feel anxious. Acknowledge your feelings without judgment.

"I've been with him for a couple months. We will talk everyday and he will get mad over something I will say and not talk to me. We have our great moments, but I just need to focus on my personal situations, and I feel he is slowing me down with that. I still wanna be with him, but not now.","I have learned that the best approach is to say that you need the time to get yourself together, mature, learn, outside of a intimate relationship but just in a friend to friend relationship...don't blame him or point fingers at him.... most likely if you did that it would not go well.  If you make it about you and that you want the best for him while you work on self, it would be taken better.  ","Okay, this is a really common and tricky situation. It sounds like you're experiencing a push-pull dynamic with this guy, and you're right to recognize it's impacting your ability to focus on *you* right now. It's good you're acknowledging that even though you have feelings for him, the timing isn't right. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering the feelings, the communication, and setting boundaries, broken down into sections:

**1. Understanding What's Happening**

* **The ""Hot & Cold"" Pattern:** His getting angry and then silent is a form of emotional manipulation, even if he doesn't realize it. It creates anxiety and keeps you seeking his approval.  It's not a healthy way to handle conflict.  It's essentially a way of controlling the dynamic.
* **Your Needs Matter:** You're absolutely right to prioritize your personal situations.  Growth and self-focus are *essential* during times of change or challenge.  A supportive partner will *encourage* that, not hinder it.
* **Wanting to Remain Connected (But Not Now):** This is valid. You can care about someone without being *in* a relationship with them. Recognizing this distinction is important.
* **Slowing You Down:** You’ve identified the core issue: he's preventing you from moving forward.  This is a huge insight.



**2. The Conversation - What to Say (and How)**

This is the hardest part, but crucial.  You need to be clear, firm, and focus on *your* needs.  Here are a few options, ranging in directness.  Choose the one that feels most comfortable for you, but try to aim for the more direct ones, as they lead to less ambiguity:

* **Option 1 (More Direct):**  ""I really enjoy our time together, and I care about you. However, I'm realizing I need to focus on some things in my own life right now.  I need space to work through [mention briefly *what* you're focusing on - you don't need to overshare details, just a general idea, like 'personal goals,' 'family matters,' or 'my own well-being'].  The way we’ve been interacting, with the ups and downs, is making it difficult for me to do that. I need a break from talking every day and from the dynamic where disagreements lead to silence.  I’m not saying this is forever, but I need this for myself *now*.""

* **Option 2 (Slightly Softer, but Still Clear):** ""I've been doing some thinking, and I've realized I need to prioritize myself for a bit. I'm working on some personal things, and I need the space and emotional energy to do that effectively. I value our connection, but I’ve noticed that when we disagree, it throws me off and makes it harder to focus on what I need to do. I think it would be best for both of us if we took a step back from daily communication for a while.""

* **Option 3 (Focus on the Pattern - Good if you want to address the issue directly):** ""I’ve noticed a pattern where we have great conversations, but then things get difficult when we disagree, and you withdraw. That's really hard for me, and it makes it difficult for me to feel secure and also to focus on things I need to do in my life. I need to take some time to work on myself, and I can’t do that when I’m constantly worried about potentially upsetting you and then not hearing from you. I need some space.""

**Key things to include in *any* version:**

*   **""I"" Statements:**  Focus on *your* feelings and needs (""I need..."", ""I feel..."", ""For me...""). Avoid blaming (""You make me..."", ""You always..."").
*   **Be Firm:**  Don’t apologize for needing space. It's a healthy boundary.
*   **Avoid False Hope:**  Don't say things like ""Maybe in the future..."" if you're not genuinely open to that.  Being honest, even if it's hard, is kinder.  ""I don’t know what the future holds, but right now this is what I need.""
* **Expect a Reaction:** He may be upset, defensive, or try to guilt you.  Prepare yourself for this.  Don't get drawn into an argument.  Repeat your needs calmly and firmly.




**3. Setting Boundaries & Following Through**

* **What ""Space"" Means:**  Define this *clearly* for yourself. Does it mean no contact for a week? A month?  Less frequent texting?  No dates? Stick to your definition.

"When I get talked to by my dad or stepmom, or if I'm in trouble, I will begin to cry and not say what's wrong with me.

It's incredibly common to shut down when feeling overwhelmed, especially when facing authority figures like parents or stepparents, *especially* when you feel like you're in trouble. It's also really common to struggle to articulate *why* you're upset in the moment. Here's a breakdown of why this might be happening, and a bunch of ideas for how to cope, broken down into sections.  I'll try to be thorough, but please read the disclaimer at the end.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Fight, Flight, or Freeze:** Your reaction sounds a lot like the ""freeze"" response to stress. When we feel threatened (and being scolded or feeling in trouble *can* feel threatening, even if that's not their intention), our bodies can go into fight, flight, or freeze.  Crying is often part of the freeze response – it's a physical release, but it also kind of shuts down your ability to think clearly and speak.
* **Emotional Flooding:** When you're overwhelmed, it's like your brain gets flooded with emotions. It's hard to access the part of your brain that uses logic and language when you're experiencing intense feelings.  That's why you draw a blank when they ask what's wrong.
* **Fear of Judgment/Escalation:** You might unconsciously be afraid that *if* you explain what's wrong, it will make things worse.  Maybe you worry they won't understand, they'll get angry, or they'll dismiss your feelings.  This fear can make it even harder to speak up.
* **Difficulty Identifying Emotions:** Some people struggle to *name* their feelings. It's not that they don't *have* feelings, it's just harder to pinpoint what they are. (""Is it sadness?  Is it anger? Is it frustration? Is it feeling misunderstood?"")
* **Past Experiences:**  If you've had experiences in the past where trying to explain yourself to them didn't go well, you've likely learned to associate speaking up with negative outcomes.
* **Relationship Dynamics:**  The overall relationship you have with your dad and stepmom plays a big role. If you feel generally safe and supported, it's easier to open up. If the relationship is strained, it's understandably harder.



**What You Can Do *In the Moment* (When You're Starting to Feel Overwhelmed)**

These are things to try *as* you start to feel the tears welling up, or when they start asking what's wrong:

* **Acknowledge the Feeling (to yourself):** Silently say to yourself, ""Okay, I'm feeling overwhelmed right now.""  Just recognizing the feeling can help a little.
* **Slow Your Breathing:**  This is a really simple one, but it works.  Take a few slow, deep breaths.  Inhale deeply through your nose, and exhale slowly through your mouth. This helps calm your nervous system. (Try the 4-7-8 technique: inhale for 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8).
* **Ask for a Moment:**  Say (even if it's through tears), ""Can I have a minute to think about that?"" or ""I need a moment to collect my thoughts.""  This buys you some time.  It's okay to *not* have an immediate answer.
* **Use a Simple Statement:**  If you can't articulate *why* you're upset, try a very basic statement like:
    * ""I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now.""
    * ""I'm feeling upset, but I need a minute to explain.""
    * ""I'm having trouble putting it into words.""
* **Write It Down (if possible):** If you have a pen and paper handy, quickly jot down a few keywords or phrases that describe what's bothering you. You can show them the note.
* **Focus on a Physical Sensation:**  Sometimes, focusing on something physical can ground you.  Feel your feet on the floor, or squeeze your hands together.
* **Don't Apologize for Crying:**  It's okay to cry.  It's a natural emotional response.  You don't need to say ""I'm sorry"" for feeling your feelings.

**What You Can Do *Outside* of Those Moments (Preparation)**

These are things you can work on when you're calm to make things easier later:

* **Journaling:**  Write down your thoughts and feelings regularly.  This can help you identify patterns and learn to label your emotions. Don't worry about grammar or making it perfect – just write whatever comes to mind.
* **Emotion Wheel/List",0.5265241861343384,3.9518426454768067e-79,0.08292682926829267,0.21739130434782608

Here's a breakdown of how to deal with this, covering immediate safety, building your resilience, and finding support.  I'll try to be thorough, but please read the disclaimer at the end, as this isn't a substitute for professional help.

**1. Prioritize Your Safety - Immediate Steps**

*   **Avoidance (When Possible):** This isn't a *solution*, but it's a survival tactic. If you can identify *when* and *where* the bullying happens, try to avoid those places and times.  Change your route to class, eat lunch in a different location, or try to stay near friends.
*   **Buddy System:**  Is there *anyone* at school you trust, even just a little?  See if you can walk with them between classes, sit with them at lunch, or just have someone nearby.  Strength in numbers can sometimes deter a bully.
*   **Grey Rock Method:** Bullies thrive on reaction.  The ""grey rock"" method involves becoming as uninteresting as possible.  When they try to provoke you, respond with short, neutral answers (""Okay,"" ""Maybe,"" ""I don't know"").  Avoid eye contact, don't show emotion, and don't offer any information about yourself.  It's about denying them the satisfaction of getting a rise out of you.  This is *hard* to do, but can be effective.
*   **Document Everything:** This is *crucial*, even if it feels like it's not helping right now. Keep a detailed record of every incident. Include:
    *   **Date and Time:**
    *   **Location:**
    *   **Who was involved (bullies and any witnesses):**
    *   **What happened:**  Be specific.  What was said? What was done?
    *   **Your Reaction:** How did it make you feel?
    *   **What you reported to teachers (if anything) and their response:**  This is important to show a pattern of inaction.
    *   Save any evidence - screenshots of messages, social media posts, etc.
* **Don't Retaliate:** It's natural to want to fight back, but retaliation can get *you* in trouble and escalate the situation.  It also doesn't address the core problem.



**2.  Since Teachers Aren't Helping - Escalating the Issue**

*   **Go Higher Up:** If teachers are failing you, you need to go to someone with more authority:
    *   **Counselor:**  School counselors are often better equipped to handle bullying situations than teachers.  They may be able to mediate or advocate for you.
    *   **Assistant Principal/Vice Principal:**  Take your documented evidence to them.
    *   **Principal:**  If the Assistant Principal doesn't help, go to the Principal.
    *   **School Board:** This is a more drastic step, but if the school administration is completely unresponsive, you can contact the school board.
*   **Parent/Guardian Involvement:**  This is really important.  Your parents or guardians need to be aware of what's happening and advocate for you with the school.  They can attend meetings with school officials and demand action.  If you're afraid to tell your parents, please see section 4 about finding trusted adults.
*   **Formal Written Complaint:** Have your parents/guardians write a formal, written complaint to the school administration detailing the bullying, the lack of response from teachers, and what you expect them to do.  Keep a copy for your records.
* **Know Your Rights:** Research your school's and your state's anti-bullying policies.  You can usually find these online. Knowing your rights can empower you to advocate for yourself.

**3. Building Your Resilience & Self-Worth**

*   **Focus on Your Strengths:** What are you good at? What do you enjoy?  Spend time doing those things.  Bullying is designed to make you feel bad about yourself, so actively counteract that by focusing on your positive qualities.
*   **Find Your Tribe:**  Connect with people who share your interests, even if it's outside of school.  Join clubs, sports teams, online communities, or volunteer groups.  Having supportive relationships is vital.
*   **Self-Care:**  Take care of your physical and emotional health.  Eat healthy, get enough sleep, exercise, and find healthy ways to manage stress (e",0.5005555748939514,3.109646448543514e-155,0.11325301204819278,0.2587145969498911
"Sometimes, when I look at my pet cat, I think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him. It makes me sad because I love him, but I always think about how helpless he is. There've even been split-seconds where I felt almost tempted to kick him, followed by shame and guilt.","A lot of different things could be happening here. Do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is? If you have not actually kicked him, then I would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt, since you did not hurt him. What else is there?It would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you. It could be that you feel safe with your cat, so strong emotions come up because you feel safe.","Okay, this is a really important thing you're sharing, and it's good you're acknowledging these feelings. It takes courage to admit to something like that, especially the part about the fleeting thought of harming your cat. It's *very* common to experience intrusive thoughts, and it's crucial to understand what's happening here. Let's break down what you've described, and then I'll offer some suggestions for how to cope.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Intrusive Thoughts:** The sudden, unwanted thought of kicking your cat is almost certainly an *intrusive thought*. These are thoughts that pop into your head seemingly out of nowhere, and they're often disturbing or upsetting. They *don't* reflect your character or your actual desires.  Almost everyone experiences them at some point. The content can be violent, sexual, or otherwise distressing.  The fact that you feel immediate shame and guilt afterward is a **very strong indication** that this thought goes against your core values.  People who *want* to harm their pets don't typically feel that kind of remorse.
* **Anxiety and Over-Attachment:** Your strong love for your cat, combined with anxiety about his vulnerability, is likely fueling these thoughts. The intensity of your affection makes you hyper-aware of the potential for harm, and that anxiety can manifest in strange ways, including these intrusive thoughts.  You're projecting your own fear onto the idea of inflicting harm, and that's incredibly distressing. It's like your brain is trying to process the worst possible scenario.
* **Control and Powerlessness:** The feeling of your cat's helplessness likely taps into your own feelings about control. Sometimes, when we feel overwhelmed or powerless in our own lives, our brains can fixate on situations where we *could* exert control, even in a negative way. This is not to excuse the thought, but to understand its potential origin.
* **The Cycle of Intrusive Thoughts:** Intrusive thoughts often become worse when we try to suppress them.  The more you try *not* to think about something, the more your brain fixates on it.  This creates a cycle of thought, anxiety, guilt, and more thoughts.
* **Not wanting to act on it:** You are very clearly disturbed by these thoughts. The fact that you feel immediate shame and guilt is a *protective* factor. It shows you have a strong moral compass and would never actually follow through with harming your cat.



**What You Can Do**

1. **Self-Compassion:** This is *crucial*. Be kind to yourself. You are not a bad person for having these thoughts. They are a symptom of anxiety and a sensitive heart, not a reflection of your character.  Tell yourself things like, ""It's okay to have unsettling thoughts sometimes. It doesn't mean I want to act on them.""

2. **Acceptance (Not Endorsement):**  This is tough, but important.  Instead of fighting the thought (""No, no, no, I would *never*!""), try to acknowledge it without judgment.  Think, ""Okay, my brain just had that thought. That's a strange thought, and it doesn't mean anything about who I am.""  Acceptance breaks the cycle of trying to suppress it.

3. **Labeling the Thought:** When the thought arises, mentally label it as an ""intrusive thought.""  This creates some distance between you and the thought, reminding you that it's not a genuine desire.  ""There's that intrusive thought again.""

4. **Mindfulness and Grounding:**  Practice mindfulness exercises to stay present in the moment. This can help reduce overall anxiety.  Grounding techniques (like focusing on your five senses – what you see, hear, smell, taste, touch) can also pull you out of anxious thought patterns.

5. **Distraction (Used Carefully):**  While not a long-term solution, distraction can help interrupt the cycle *in the moment*. Engage in an activity you enjoy: read a book, listen to music, go for a walk, play with your cat (if you feel able to), etc. **However, don't use distraction to avoid dealing with the underlying anxiety.**

6. **Address the Anxiety:**  What's causing anxiety in your life *besides* your concern for your cat?  Work stress? Relationship issues?  Financial worries?  Addressing these underlying stressors can reduce the overall level of anxiety that's fueling the intrusive thoughts.

7. **Positive Interaction with Your Cat:**  Actively engage in positive interactions with your cat.  Play with him, cuddle him, groom him.  Reinforce your loving bond. This can help counteract the negative thoughts and remind you of your affection.

8. **Professional Help:** **This is the most important recommendation.**",0.5143077373504639,5.510068956198222e-79,0.08726415094339623,0.24690650233265599
"I just lost my grandpa and i'm having a rough time with it.    I need some help to deal with the loss, but I don’t think I can pay for counseling. Where Can I get help?","If you connect with your therapist and can say whatever you want to say and not be judged. If you feel like things, situations, your outlook are shifting for you.","Okay, I am so incredibly sorry for your loss. Losing a grandpa is a uniquely painful experience, and it's completely understandable that you're having a rough time. It's also very responsible of you to recognize you need support. And it's smart to think about financial constraints – it's okay to need help *without* being able to pay for it. Here's a breakdown of resources available to you, categorized for ease of use. I'll include a lot, because what works for one person doesn't work for another.  I'll also add notes about what each resource is generally good for.

"When I see something I don’t like, I go off like a ticking time bomb. I go from “0 to 100” really quickly.","Sometimes we react to situations immediately, without thinking of the consequences of our actions. Typically by not reacting right away, we are better able to gather our thoughts, see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives, and respond more calmly. One of the strategies that almost always helps is deep breathing. When faced with a stressful situation, you can give yourself a time out by removing yourself from the stress and spend 5 minutes taking deep breaths (breathe in slowly counting to 4 and breathe out even slower counting to 6), while focusing and thinking only about your breathing. After doing so, think of the various ways you can respond to the situation and choose the one most appropriate. Good luck!","Okay, it sounds like you're recognizing a pattern of really intense, fast-escalating emotional reactions when you encounter something you dislike. That's really good self-awareness! Calling it ""going off like a ticking time bomb"" and ""0 to 100"" paints a very vivid picture.  It suggests you experience a *very* rapid shift from calm (or relatively calm) to a highly reactive state. 

Let's break down what might be happening and explore some things that could help.  I'll try to be thorough, but remember I'm an AI and can't offer therapy. This is for informational purposes only, and if this is significantly impacting your life, *please* consider seeking professional help (I'll add resources at the end).

**Understanding What's Likely Happening**

* **Emotional Dysregulation:** This is a core concept here. It means difficulty managing the intensity and duration of your emotional responses. It's not about *not* feeling emotions, it's about how quickly they escalate and how hard it is to bring them back down.
* **Triggers:**  You mentioned ""something you don't like.""  These are your triggers. These can be specific events, situations, people, thoughts, or even internal sensations.  What specifically sets you off? Is it injustice, feeling disrespected, being interrupted, feeling controlled, certain tones of voice, remembering past events? Identifying your triggers is a *huge* first step.
* **Physiological Response:** When you ""go to 100,"" your body is likely going into a stress response (fight, flight, or freeze). This means:
    * **Increased heart rate:**  Your heart pounds.
    * **Rapid breathing:**  You might breathe faster or feel short of breath.
    * **Muscle tension:** You might clench your jaw, fists, or shoulders.
    * **Hormone release:**  Cortisol and adrenaline flood your system.
    * **Tunnel vision/Focus:**  Your attention narrows, making it hard to think clearly.
* **Underlying Emotions:**  Often, the initial ""dislike"" is a surface emotion.  Underneath might be things like:
    * **Fear:**  Are you afraid of being hurt, vulnerable, or losing control?
    * **Frustration:**  Are your expectations not being met?
    * **Anger:**  This is often the most obvious, but it can be a secondary emotion masking something else.
    * **Shame/Guilt:**  Sometimes reactions are rooted in feeling inadequate or like you've done something wrong.
    * **Anxiety:**  Worry about future events or perceived threats.
* **Learned Patterns:**  This pattern may have developed over time. Perhaps you grew up in an environment where big emotions were common, or where your feelings weren't validated.  It’s also possible that this reaction has been inadvertently reinforced – maybe a big outburst *sometimes* got you what you wanted, even if it had negative consequences.



**What You Can Do - Strategies to Try**

These are grouped into Before, During, and After the reaction.  Start with the ""Before"" steps as they are preventative.

**1. Before (Prevention - Building Skills)**

* **Trigger Identification:**  Keep a journal. When you react strongly, write down:
    * What happened *right before* you felt the escalation? (Be specific – who, what, where, when)
    * What were you thinking at the time?
    * What did you feel physically? (heart racing, etc.)
    * What was your reaction?
    * Over time, patterns will emerge.
* **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  Regular practice (even 5-10 minutes a day) can help you become more aware of your internal state *before* you get overwhelmed.  It’s about noticing thoughts and feelings without judgment. Apps like Headspace, Calm, and Insight Timer are great starting points.
* **Deep Breathing Exercises:**  Practice these *when you're calm* so you can use them when stressed.  Box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4) is a good one. Diaphragmatic breathing (belly breathing) is also effective.
* **Grounding Techniques:** These help bring you back to the present moment.  Examples:
    * **5-4-3-2-1:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Focus on physical sensations:**  Feel your feet on the ground, the texture of your clothes, or the temperature of the air.
* **Self-Care:**",0.47723060846328735,2.370647471820451e-155,0.07474226804123713,0.25294303567912624
I need to speak to someone about sexual addiction and binge eating immediately.,There are plenty of online providers within the mental health field that would me more than happy to speak with you immediately.  Many of them provide treatment on a sliding scale fee.  I would google online mental health treatment providers and that should lead you to a list of providers that can help you. ,"Okay, you're incredibly brave for reaching out, and it's good you recognize you need support.  It's really important to connect with someone *right now* given you say ""immediately.""  Here are several options, with different levels of immediacy and approaches.  I'm including a lot because what feels right for *you* in this moment is what matters most.  I'll break it down into crisis lines (for right now), warmlines (for immediate support but not necessarily crisis level), and resources for ongoing help.  **Please read through the whole list, even if you initially think one sounds best. Sometimes, knowing all your options is helpful.**

*   **Emergency Room:** If you feel you are in immediate danger, go to your nearest emergency room.

**II. IMMEDIATE SUPPORT - WARM LINES (Non-crisis, but needing to talk *now*):**

Warm lines are staffed by people who can listen and offer support, but aren't necessarily crisis intervention specialists. They're great if you need to talk things through right away but aren't in immediate danger.  Availability varies, so check their websites.

"He's been losing feelings and he doesn't know why. I love him very very much. He sometimes thinks I'm obsessed when I'm not at all. I give him his space and I make sure he's okay but sometimes I think if me and him saw each other more it would be better? I truly want me and him to get better, it's kind of hard not to stress about it, because the love of my life is losing feelings which is a sad feeling. He's a great guy! I just don't know why he's been losing feelings towards me. He's starting to put less effort in talking to me. At this point I'll do anything to just make us better as a couple. I tried talking to him but he doesn't like talking about it much. Advice on what to do?","I'm willing to bet that this isn't what you are hoping to hear, but I'd suggest giving him space. Ooph, that's a tough one, right?! I know. But here's the thing, when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away. He needs to feel like a solid and whole person (as you do too) to be able to be fully in your relationship. It's the work of being in relationship to learn this. I get that this is tough stuff. I wonder, outside of being with him, how do you soothe and calm yourself? That's the stuff for you to tune into and focus on right now.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's completely understandable why you're so stressed and heartbroken. It's agonizing to feel someone you love drifting away, especially when you don't understand why. Here's a breakdown of advice, trying to cover a lot of angles, and acknowledging the difficulties you're already facing.  I'll break it down into sections: Understanding the Situation, What You Can Do (Directly), What You Can Do (For Yourself), and When to Consider Bigger Steps.

**1. Understanding the Situation (As Much as Possible)**

* **""Losing feelings"" is vague:**  It doesn't mean the love is *gone*, but it suggests a shift.  It could be a loss of *romantic* feeling, a feeling of disconnection, boredom, stress from other areas of his life bleeding into the relationship, or something else entirely.  It's crucial to try (gently) to understand *what* feels different to *him*.
* **The ""Obsession"" Misinterpretation:** This is a HUGE red flag, even if he doesn't mean it maliciously.  Your efforts to check in and support him are *healthy* behaviors in a relationship, but if he's perceiving them as controlling or clingy, that’s a disconnect.  It suggests he might have some issues with needing a lot of independence, or maybe has past experiences that are coloring his perception.  It's *not* you being obsessive; it's him misinterpreting your care.
* **Effort Fluctuations:**  The decrease in effort to talk is a significant symptom.  It suggests he's either withdrawing emotionally or prioritizing other things.  Again, trying to understand *why* is key.
* **His Avoidance of Talking:** This is the biggest hurdle.  People avoid difficult conversations for many reasons: fear of hurting you, not knowing *how* to articulate their feelings, fear of conflict, or simply wanting to avoid dealing with something uncomfortable.



**2. What You Can Do (Directly - Even Though It's Hard)**

* **One More Focused, Calm Conversation (Choose the right time!):**  Even if he's resisted talking before, try *one* more time, but approach it differently.  Don't accuse, don't demand, don't analyze his feelings *for* him.  Instead, focus on *your* feelings and observations, using ""I"" statements. 
    * **Example:** ""I've noticed we haven't been talking as much lately, and I've been feeling a little disconnected. I miss feeling close to you.  I'm not trying to put pressure on you, but I'd really appreciate it if you could share even a little bit about what's been going on for you. I want to understand.""
    * **Important:**  Be prepared for him to *still* shut down. Don't push it if he's clearly overwhelmed.  Just let him know you're there when he's ready.
* **Ask Specific, Open-Ended Questions (not ""why are you losing feelings?"")**  Instead of asking about feelings directly, try things like:
    * ""Is there anything going on in your life that's been taking up a lot of your energy lately?""
    * ""What's been on your mind these past few weeks?""
    * ""Is there anything *I* can do to support you better, even if it's just giving you space?"" (This acknowledges his need for space but also shows you're willing to help.)
* **Small, Intentional Connection Attempts:** Instead of grand gestures, focus on small things that used to bring you closer.  A shared inside joke, a favorite song, a small thoughtful gesture. Don't do these expecting an immediate return; do them because *you* want to connect.
* **Acknowledge His Need for Space (Even If It Hurts):**  This is brutal, but important.  Constantly trying to reach out when he's pulling away will likely reinforce his feeling that you're ""too much."" Respect his boundaries, *but* make sure he knows you’re available when *he* initiates.



**3. What You Can Do (For Yourself - This is CRITICAL)**

* **Self-Care is Not Selfish:** This is *not* the time to fall apart.  You need to prioritize your own well-being.  Spend time with friends and family, pursue hobbies, exercise, eat well, get enough sleep.  Do things that make *you* feel good and grounded.
* **Separate Your Worth from the Relationship:**  His feelings are *his* responsibility, not yours.  His loss of feelings doesn't diminish your value as a person.  Remind yourself of your strengths, your passions,",0.5081026554107666,2.9971140330542225e-155,0.10386473429951691,0.3062452358687025
"I believe my partner has a masturbation and porn problem. He masturbates daily, even when I am lying in bed sleeping beside him. We have sex once a week. He is rough and worries about his needs. He never touches me, and treats me like a porn star, wanting to finish on my face or chest.","It sounds like your in quite a rough place, my recommendation just based on what you type might warrant a visit to a psychotherapist to resolve what may be going on, I am not entirely sure but it sounds like he might have a bit of a sex addiction problem. One thing you need to ask yourself is ""Am I happy?"", ""Do I feel loved?"", these are deep questions, but the answers to those questions will give you a direction to travel in. ","Okay, this sounds incredibly painful and invalidating, and you're right to be concerned and to seek support. It's clear this is impacting your emotional and physical intimacy, and it's deeply affecting your sense of self-worth and connection with your partner.  Here's a breakdown of what's going on, what might be happening, and how to approach it, broken down into sections.  Please read the **Important Disclaimer** at the end, as this is a complex issue and professional help is strongly recommended.

**1. Understanding the Situation**

* **Problematic Pornography Use & Compulsive Behavior:** Daily masturbation *in itself* isn't necessarily a ""problem"" if it's not causing distress or interfering with life. *However*, the context you've provided – doing it while you're sleeping, the impact on your sex life, and the associated behaviors – strongly suggests it *is* problematic. It's edging into compulsive behavior, where it's being used to cope, escape, or fulfill needs that aren't being met in the relationship.  The fact he's doing it *while you sleep* is a huge red flag. It indicates a lack of consideration for your feelings and boundaries.
* **Disconnect in Intimacy:**  The disparity between the frequency of his masturbation and your sexual encounters is significant.  A healthy sexual relationship involves mutual desire and connection.  Once a week is fine *if* both partners are satisfied, but coupled with the other issues, it points to a deeper imbalance.
* **Objectification & Disrespect:**  His treating you ""like a porn star"" and focusing on his own gratification (finishing on your face/chest *without your enthusiastic consent*) is deeply disrespectful and objectifying. This is not intimacy; it's using you as a vessel for his own pleasure. This is abusive behavior, even if not intentionally malicious.  It erodes trust and emotional safety.
* **Roughness & Self-Focus:** The roughness and prioritization of his own needs during sex are also indicative of a lack of empathy and consideration for your pleasure and well-being.  It sounds like your needs are not being considered *at all*.



**2. What Might Be Underlying This?**

It's important to understand that this isn't necessarily about *you* being ""not enough.""  There are many potential reasons for this behavior, and they often lie within *him*.  Here are some possibilities:

* **Pornography-Induced Expectations:**  Pornography can create unrealistic expectations about sex, arousal, and performance. It can desensitize individuals and distort their perceptions of healthy sexual interaction.
* **Emotional Avoidance:**  He might be using pornography and masturbation to cope with stress, anxiety, depression, or other difficult emotions.  It's a form of escape.
* **Underlying Sexual Issues:**  There could be underlying issues related to sexual trauma, shame, or anxiety that he hasn't addressed.
* **Relationship Issues:**  Unresolved conflicts or emotional distance within the relationship could be contributing to his behavior.  He might be withdrawing emotionally and seeking gratification elsewhere.
* **Addiction:**  While not everyone who uses pornography is addicted, compulsive pornography use can develop into an addiction, characterized by loss of control and negative consequences.
* **Lack of Communication Skills:** He may not know *how* to communicate his needs and desires in a healthy way, or how to be attentive to yours.



**3. What You Can Do (and What You Shouldn't)**

This is a delicate situation. Here's a suggested approach:

* **Prioritize Your Safety & Well-being:**  Before anything else, ensure your own emotional and physical safety.  The behavior you're describing is damaging, and you deserve to be treated with respect.
* **Choose the Right Time & Place:**  Don't try to have this conversation during or after a sexual encounter, or when either of you is stressed or tired. Choose a calm, private setting where you can both talk openly and honestly.
* **""I"" Statements:**  Focus on how *his* behavior makes *you* feel.  For example:
    *  ""I feel hurt and rejected when you masturbate while I'm sleeping beside you.""
    *  ""I feel like an object when you only focus on your own pleasure during sex.""
    *  ""I feel unimportant when we only have sex once a week, and it feels rushed and impersonal.""
    *  ""I feel scared when you want to finish on my face/chest without asking."" (Emphasize the *lack of consent* aspect).
* **Be Specific:**  Avoid vague accusations.  Clearly explain the behaviors that are bothering you.
* **Set Boundaries:**  This is crucial.  You need to clearly state what you are and are not willing to",0.46938657760620117,0.008203385457762467,0.07453416149068323,0.23293385163254132
"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","Please feel free to cry during therapy if you suddenly feel painful emotions arising when you describe some of your unsatisfying and unfulfilling relationships and situations.Crying when realizing the emotional hurt and unfairness between you and someone, clears you for new ways of handling interactions.As a therapist, I always have a box of tissues on the table next to the couch where people who utilize my therapy, sit.I hope you will soon discover that once your tears unlock your awareness of harmful relationships in your life, you will quickly see the freedom to establish new and happier patterns of relating.Have a good therapy!","Okay, it's *completely* normal to be freaking out before starting therapy, and it's *especially* normal to be worried about crying! Seriously, you are SO not alone in this fear. Let's break it down and talk about why it's okay, why it happens, and why it's absolutely not something to be deeply embarrassed about.

**First, let's normalize crying in therapy:**

* **Therapy is a safe space to feel.** That's literally the point! It's designed to be a place where you can let down your guard and explore difficult emotions *without* judgment. Crying is a natural emotional release. If something is bringing up strong feelings, your body is responding appropriately.  It's a sign you're *doing the work*.
* **Most therapists are very used to clients crying.** It's a really common occurrence. They aren't going to be shocked or think less of you. They've seen it all, and they're trained to handle it with sensitivity and professionalism.  They likely have tissues readily available!
* **Crying isn't ""embarrassing.""** Our society often puts a stigma on crying, especially for adults, but it's a healthy human response.  It doesn't mean you're weak or dramatic. It means you're human.
* **It doesn't mean you're ""broken.""**  You're not going into therapy because you're fundamentally flawed. You're going because you're brave enough to want to work on things, and sometimes that brings up pain.

**Why you might cry (and why it's okay in these situations):**

* **Relief:** Sometimes, just *starting* to talk about difficult things can be incredibly relieving, and that relief can manifest as tears.
* **Vulnerability:** Opening up to someone new, even a professional, requires vulnerability. That can be scary and emotionally taxing.
* **Processing Past Trauma:** If you're dealing with past experiences, bringing them to the surface can be painful.
* **Identifying Feelings:** Sometimes we don't even realize *how* deeply we feel something until we start exploring it in therapy.
* **Simply Feeling Heard:**  Just having someone truly listen and validate your experiences can be incredibly powerful and emotional.



**What can you do to prepare and ease your anxiety about crying?**

* **Acknowledge the fear:**  You've already done this! Recognizing that you're worried is the first step.
* **Remind yourself of the points above:**  Therapy *is* a safe space. It's *normal* to cry. Your therapist *wants* to help you process your emotions.
* **It's okay to say ""I'm worried I'll cry.""**  You can tell your therapist upfront, ""I'm a little nervous about this, and I tend to get emotional when talking about things. I just want to let you know.""  This allows them to be prepared and can actually help *you* feel more comfortable.
* **Bring tissues.**  Practical, but it can give you a little more control.
* **Allow yourself to feel.** Don't fight the tears if they come. Trying to suppress them can actually make things more difficult.
* **Remember your therapist is a professional.** They won't judge you, and they have tools to help you manage your emotions. They might offer grounding techniques, or simply provide a supportive silence.
* **Focus on your goals:** Remind yourself *why* you're going to therapy. This can help you reframe crying as a step towards healing.

**What if you *do* cry and feel embarrassed?**

* **It's okay to apologize for being emotional.** You can say something like, ""I'm sorry, I'm getting a little emotional.""  But you don't *need* to apologize for feeling!
* **Your therapist will likely normalize it for you.** They might say something like, ""It's perfectly okay to cry. This is a safe space to feel your emotions.""
* **Take deep breaths.**  Focus on your breathing to help calm yourself.
* **Remember why you're there.**  



**Ultimately:**  Your fear of crying is a sign that you're sensitive and in touch with your emotions. That's a strength, not a weakness.  Don't let the fear of tears prevent you from getting the support you deserve.

**One last thought:**  If the thought of crying is truly paralyzing and keeps you from even *starting* therapy, you could also explore whether a different therapeutic approach (like art therapy or somatic experiencing) might feel more comfortable initially. But don’t let this fear stop you from trying talk therapy.

How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,This is a tough decision to make for anyone that has ever been involved in a relationship.  My advice is for you to consider what is making you unhappy in this relationship.  Sometimes we think we are ready to move on but don't know the reason why and then we regret it.  The worst thing you want after the fact is to have regret.  Take time to do some soul searching and imagine your life without this person before you make any decisions.  This will also help you understand what it is you are looking for in a romantic relationship. Best of luck in your love life. Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling,"Okay, this is a big one. Deciding whether to end a relationship is incredibly difficult, and it's good you're taking the time to really think it through. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, broken down into sections.  It's long, but thorough - this deserves a thorough exploration!  I'll cover self-reflection, looking at the relationship, considering options, and then making a decision.  I'll also include some things to consider *before* you have ""the talk"" if you decide to end things.

**I. Self-Reflection: What Do *You* Need?**

Before you even dive into the specifics of the relationship, you need to get clear on your own needs, wants, and boundaries.

*   **Your Happiness:**  Honestly, are you generally happy in this relationship? Not just ""okay,"" but genuinely joyful and fulfilled more often than not?  If you consistently feel drained, anxious, or unhappy, that's a major red flag.
*   **Your Values:**  Are your core values aligned?  Things like honesty, family, ambition, spirituality, lifestyle, etc.  Differences are okay, but fundamental clashes can be very difficult to overcome.
*   **Your Needs:** What do *you* need in a relationship to feel loved, supported, and secure?  (e.g., affection, quality time, intellectual connection, emotional vulnerability, physical intimacy, help with practical tasks). Are those needs being met?  Are they *able* to be met by this person?
*   **Your Future:**  Where do you see yourself in 1, 5, 10 years?  Does he fit into that picture?  Not in a ""marriage and 2.5 kids"" kind of way if that's not what you want, but in terms of your life goals and aspirations.
*   **Your Self-Worth:**  Does this relationship make you feel good about yourself?  Does he uplift you, or does he tear you down (even subtly)?  Do you feel like you can be your authentic self around him?
*   **Your Dealbreakers:**  Everyone has them.  What are yours? (e.g., dishonesty, disrespect, controlling behavior, substance abuse, lack of ambition, different views on children, etc.).  Have any of your dealbreakers been crossed?



**II. Evaluating the Relationship: What's Really Going On?**

Now, let's look at the relationship itself. Be as objective as possible.  It helps to write this down.

*   **Communication:** How is your communication? Is it open, honest, and respectful? Do you feel heard and understood? Or do you often feel like you're walking on eggshells, arguing in circles, or being dismissed?  Are you able to resolve conflicts constructively?
*   **Trust:**  Is there trust in the relationship?  Has it been broken? If so, has it been genuinely repaired?  (Repair requires consistent action, not just apologies).
*   **Respect:**  Does he respect you – your opinions, your boundaries, your time, your feelings?  Respect is *essential*.  Look for both big displays and everyday actions.
*   **Intimacy (Emotional & Physical):** Are you both emotionally connected?  Is there physical affection?  Are both of you satisfied with the level of intimacy? (This isn’t just about sex; it’s about feeling close and connected.)
*   **Effort:**  Is there equal effort being put into the relationship by both of you?  Does it feel one-sided?  Are you constantly initiating dates, conversations, or trying to fix things?
*   **Patterns:**  What are the recurring patterns in your relationship? Do you find yourselves having the same arguments over and over?  Are there cycles of closeness and distance?  Patterns are hard to break, and often reveal deeper issues.
*   **Red Flags:**  Looking back, were there any red flags early on that you ignored or minimized?  (Sometimes, it's easier to see things clearly with hindsight).
*   **The Good:** Don't just focus on the negative. What *does* work well? What do you appreciate about him and the relationship?  This is important to acknowledge.



**III. Have You Tried to Fix Things?**

Before making a final decision, consider if you've genuinely tried to address the issues.

*   **Talked About It:** Have you clearly and calmly communicated your concerns to him?  (Using ""I"" statements is crucial:  ""I feel X when you do Y"" instead of ""You always do Y."")
*   **Compromise:** Are you both willing to compromise and meet each other halfway?
*   **Counseling:** Have you considered couples counseling?  A therapist can provide a neutral",0.5028802752494812,6.408409960839645e-79,0.10526315789473684,0.25516403402187127
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","The short answer is: absolutely not! The longer answer is that it might take some time to process all of the issues, and it may feel quite ""muddy"" in the issues for a lot longer than is tolerable (which is why counseling may have been postponed to begin with for you.) It's important to be realistic when entering counseling of any sort, and that the therapist be realistic with you about what you might be able to expect working with that person (I use the words ""might be able to expect"" because therapy experiences can vary.) But that not having counseling about trauma that you have experienced much earlier in your life can play a significant role in the process and how long that process could take to unpack all that may have been buried over time.It might also be helpful in counseling to work with the therapist on figuring out where to begin, but to also manage the feelings of being overwhelmed that may make it hard to continue to show up and do the work required, week in and week out. It isn't easy work trying to process past pain that you experienced, and so consistent practice of self-care, including leaning on support systems outside of therapy, is key.","Okay, wow. That *is* a lot. And it's incredibly brave of you to even acknowledge all of this, and to ask the question about starting counseling. You've carried a *huge* weight for a long time, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed just thinking about unpacking it.

Let me be very clear: **You absolutely do *not* have too many issues to address in counseling.**  That's a really common fear, that people think their problems are too complex or too numerous.  A good therapist is trained to work with complexity. In fact, often these things are intertwined - the trauma, the cancer, the sleep, the depression, the anxiety, the self-esteem... they likely *all* impact each other.

Here's a breakdown of why your concerns are valid, and why therapy can still be incredibly beneficial, along with how to approach it:

**Why it feels like ""too much"":**

* **Trauma History:** Sexual abuse is deeply impactful and often underlies many other issues, including depression, anxiety, and self-esteem. It's a foundational thing to address, but can feel daunting.
* **Medical Trauma:** Breast cancer is not just a physical battle, it's profoundly emotional and can leave lasting psychological scars.  Survivorship comes with its own set of challenges.
* **Chronic Issues:** Lifelong insomnia and long-term depression aren't ""quick fixes."" They've become ingrained patterns, and changing those takes time and dedicated work.
* **The Build-Up:** All of these experiences accumulated over time. It's a lot to suddenly bring to the surface.
* **Fear of Re-Traumatization:**  Talking about trauma can *feel* re-traumatizing, and it's a valid concern.



**Why Therapy *Can* Help – and how to approach it:**

* **Therapists are Equipped for Complexity:**  Good therapists specialize in working with complex trauma, chronic illness, and co-occurring conditions. They are trained to carefully and sensitively navigate multiple issues.
* **It Doesn't Have to Be All At Once:** You don't have to dump *everything* in the first session! A skilled therapist will work *with you* to prioritize what feels most pressing *right now*.  You set the pace.  You can start with the insomnia if that's what's most disruptive, or with the anxiety that's newly surfacing, or anything else.  
* **Interconnectedness is Key:**  A therapist will help you see how these issues relate to each other. Addressing one area can often have a positive ripple effect on others. For example, processing trauma can improve self-esteem, which can then ease anxiety.
* **Building a Safe Space:**  Therapy provides a safe, confidential, and non-judgmental space to explore these difficult experiences. This is crucial for healing.
* **Developing Coping Mechanisms:** You'll learn practical skills to manage your anxiety, improve your sleep, and challenge negative self-talk.
* **Your Marriage is a Strength:** The fact that you've had a happy marriage for 35 years is *significant*.  It's a testament to your resilience and capacity for connection. This can be a valuable source of support *alongside* therapy (though therapy is a space for *you*).




**Here are some suggestions for finding the right therapist:**

* **Look for Specializations:** Specifically search for therapists who specialize in:
    * **Trauma-Informed Therapy:**  (Essential given your history) Look for approaches like EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), or Somatic Experiencing.
    * **Cancer Survivorship:**  Some therapists specialize in the emotional needs of cancer survivors.
    * **Depression & Anxiety:**  Basic, but important.
    * **Insomnia/Sleep Disorders:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is very effective.
* **Psychology Today Directory:**  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us)  allows you to filter by specialization, insurance, and location.
* **GoodTherapy.org:** [https://www.goodtherapy.org/](https://www.goodtherapy.org/)  Another directory with a focus on ethical and responsible therapy.
* **Ask for Recommendations:**  If you feel comfortable, ask your doctor, a trusted friend, or family member for referrals.
* **Initial Consultations:**  Most therapists offer brief (15-30 minute) phone consultations.  Use these to ask questions about their experience, their approach, and whether you feel comfortable talking to them.  **Trust your gut!**  Finding the right *fit* is critical.

"I have PTSD. The side effects are really bad and have impacts on sex, anger and my relationships. I even lost my job month ago.    How can I get my life back?","Slowly is the rate at which you'll get back your life.Being traumatized means not feeling safe in almost all areas of life.Be patient with yourself as you try to regain trust that people will not harm you and will be sources of satisfaction in your life.It is possible that the trauma in your life requires such great attention on your part to your own inner emotional safety that you are better off with a less intensive job than the one you recently lost.Try to prioritize restoring your emotional and psychological health.  With this as the top area of your attention then you may have an easier time to accept a lesser degree of involvement in your work and relationships.When you feel angry, try to examine if underlying the anger are feelings of stress, fear, insecurity regarding your position in relationship to the person toward whom you feel angry.   Anger is often the surface reaction to more destabilizing emotions like fear and insecurity.Gradually by nurturing and comforting yourself, living at a pace which is uniquely comfortable to what and how much you can handle, you'll regain your trust in both yourself and relating to others.","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult, and I'm really sorry to hear you're going through this.

It's brave of you to reach out and ask for help, even just acknowledging it all is a big step.  Let's break down a path forward, understanding that this will be a process, not a quick fix.  I'll cover a lot here, and it's important to remember you don't have to do *everything* at once.  Prioritize and start small.

**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical or therapeutic advice. This information is for support and guidance only.  **Please read the ""Important Resources"" section at the end for where to get professional help.**



**1. Prioritize Safety and Stabilization (First & Foremost)**

*   **Crisis Line:** If you're having thoughts of harming yourself, *please* reach out to a crisis line immediately. (See resources at the end). Your life is valuable.
*   **Grounding Techniques:** When you feel overwhelmed, practice grounding. These bring you back to the present moment. Examples:
    *   **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you can *see*, 4 things you can *touch*, 3 things you can *hear*, 2 things you can *smell*, and 1 thing you can *taste*.
    *   **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deliberate breaths.  Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth.
    *   **Physical Sensations:**  Hold an ice cube, take a warm shower, or wrap yourself in a blanket.
*   **Safe Space:**  Identify a place (physical or mental) where you feel safe and calm.  Return to this space when you're feeling triggered.
* **Routine:** Establishing a daily routine, even a simple one, can be incredibly grounding.  Consistent wake/sleep times, mealtimes, and activities can provide a sense of predictability and control.



**2.  Professional Treatment for PTSD (This is Crucial)**

*   **Therapy:**  This is the cornerstone of PTSD recovery.  Several therapies are specifically effective:
    *   **Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT):**  Helps you process the traumatic event(s) and change negative thought patterns.
    *   **Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR):**  Uses bilateral stimulation (like eye movements) to help reprocess traumatic memories.
    *   **Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE):**  Gradually exposes you to trauma-related memories, feelings, and situations in a safe and controlled environment.
    *   **Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT):** Focuses on challenging and modifying unhelpful thoughts related to the trauma.
*   **Medication:** A psychiatrist can evaluate if medication might be helpful to manage symptoms like anxiety, depression, or sleep disturbances.  Medication isn't a cure, but it can make therapy more effective. *Never* start or stop medication without a doctor's guidance.
*   **Finding a Therapist:**  Look for a therapist specifically trained in trauma treatment.  Psychology Today's website has a directory where you can filter by specialty: [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists)  (This is just one option, see resources at end for more).



**3. Addressing Specific Impacts**

*   **Sex & Intimacy:** PTSD can significantly impact sexual desire, arousal, and ability to connect intimately.
    *   **Talk to your therapist:**  This is a sensitive topic, but a therapist can help you explore these challenges and develop coping strategies.
    *   **Communicate with your partner (if you have one):**  Honest and open communication is essential.  Explain what you're experiencing and what you need.  Be patient with yourself and your partner.
    *   **Sensate Focus:** A therapeutic technique focusing on non-demanding touch and exploring physical sensations can help rebuild intimacy. (Typically guided by a therapist)
*   **Anger:**  Trauma can manifest as intense anger, irritability, and difficulty controlling emotions.
    *   **Anger Management Techniques:**  Your therapist can teach you techniques like:
        *   **Identifying triggers:** What situations or thoughts make you angry?
        *   **Cognitive restructuring:**  Challenging angry thoughts.
        *   **Relaxation techniques:**  Deep breathing, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation.
        *   **Assertiveness training:**  Learning to express",0.49947619438171387,5.890808476557668e-79,0.11469534050179211,0.2583262169086251
I read that you should ignore them and they have to come to a conclusion that they were wrong on their own terms. Is that correct?,"It is not correct because someone who is narcissistic believes they are always right.If you ignore the person, then their thinking is that there is something wrong with you.Ignoring the person to the degree this is possible in the situation or relationship, will spare you to be misunderstood further.","Okay, you're referring to a very common piece of advice when dealing with someone who is stuck in a belief, especially a belief that's causing conflict, and particularly with people who are resistant to changing their minds. The idea of ""ignoring them and letting them come to their own conclusion"" has a lot of nuance, and you're right to ask if it's correct. Here's a breakdown of the idea, why it *can* work, why it's not a universal solution, and what the underlying principles are.  I'll try to be thorough.

**The Core Idea: Why It's Suggested**

The suggestion stems from several psychological principles:

* **Reactance:** When people feel their freedom to believe what they want is being threatened, they often dig in *harder* into their existing beliefs.  Directly challenging someone often triggers reactance. They become more determined to defend their position, even in the face of evidence.  Ignoring removes that threat.
* **Cognitive Dissonance:**  This is the discomfort people feel when holding conflicting beliefs.  If you present information that contradicts their belief, they might try to rationalize, dismiss the information, or attack you instead of changing their belief.  If *they* encounter information that challenges their belief without you being the source, it can create dissonance *internally*.  They are then more likely to resolve the dissonance by shifting their belief, because *they* are the ones doing the work.
* **Ownership:** People are much more likely to value and defend conclusions they arrive at themselves. If you tell someone they are wrong, they may resent you for it. If they figure it out on their own, they're more likely to accept it.  It's about feeling a sense of agency.
* **Avoiding the Argument Trap:** Some people are skilled at arguing, or simply enjoy it. Engaging can lead to endless circular debates that go nowhere and drain your energy.  Ignoring deprives them of the fuel (your engagement) they need to continue the cycle.
* **The Backfire Effect:** (Related to reactance) Sometimes, when presented with evidence against their beliefs, people actually strengthen their original beliefs.  This is more common with deeply held emotional beliefs.



**How ""Ignoring"" Works in Practice (It's Not Always Literal Silence)**

It's important to clarify what ""ignoring"" means.  It doesn't always mean complete radio silence.  Here's a spectrum of approaches:

* **Grey Rock Method:** This is a very popular technique, especially for dealing with manipulative or emotionally draining people. You become as uninteresting and unresponsive as a ""grey rock.""  You answer questions with brief, factual statements, avoid sharing personal information, and don't engage in emotional reactions. You're not arguing; you're just... *there*.  Example:
    * **Them:** ""Your political views are ridiculous!""
    * **You (Grey Rock):** ""Okay.""  or ""I understand you feel that way."" (Said flatly, without further engagement.)
* **Acknowledging and Disengaging:** You acknowledge what they said *without* debating it.  This can be a polite way to signal you're not taking the bait.  Example:
    * **Them:** ""Vaccines cause autism!""
    * **You:** ""I've heard that claim before."" (Then change the subject or excuse yourself.)
* **Setting Boundaries:**  This is crucial.  ""I'm not going to discuss this topic with you anymore.""  ""I'm happy to talk about other things, but I'm not going to debate this.""  This is *assertive* and not passive.  It’s not ignoring, exactly, but it’s shutting down the unproductive conversation.
* **Strategic Silence:**  In some cases, simply not responding to a provocative statement can be powerful.  Letting it hang in the air can force the other person to confront the implications of their own words.
* **Shifting the Focus:** Redirect the conversation to a neutral topic.  ""That's an interesting point.  Did you see the game last night?""



**When This Approach *Is* Likely to Work**

* **The Belief Isn't Central to Their Identity:** If it's a relatively minor opinion, they might be more willing to let it go if it's not constantly challenged.
* **They Have Some Self-Awareness:**  If they are capable of introspection, they are more likely to eventually question their own beliefs.
* **Time & Exposure to Other Information:**  The ""ignoring"" part is often most effective when combined with the person being exposed to different perspectives *over time*.  They need opportunities to encounter information that contradicts their belief without you being the messenger.
* **Low Stakes:** If the belief isn't causing significant harm",0.5027280449867249,3.600893743125194e-79,0.06976744186046512,0.18566755706498164

There are no easy answers to your questions, and I won't presume that my response to you will be the linch-pin that heals all your pain. But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. No one is perfect. We fail more often than we succeed, but in the end we learn, and that learning helps us grow. Yes, you're right, the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good, and need to stop. You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard, and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. Seeing a therapist for yourself, and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. You have issues that you need to resolve, that, while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life, they are separate from your marriage in many respects.Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. You can find these through local counseling resources. Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. If you belong to a religious or spiritual community, then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed, so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you.Lastly, parents are imperfect. Yep...its true. They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. We limp along and do our best. Having said that, we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future, no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid, and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. Both with ourselves, and toward other people. So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit.  I am sure that remains to be seen, but either way you both must be involved in saving it. If only one of you cares, then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. That's not fair. So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants, and work to create an amicable solution. All of this said, seek out supportive friends, and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life. One way or the other, you will benefit from it.Be well.","Okay, this is a lot, and it sounds incredibly painful. It's good that you're recognizing the issues and *want* to fix things. That's a huge first step. It's also incredibly important you've recognized the physical violence is not okay and needs to stop. Let's break this down into sections – what's happening, why it's happening, and what you can *do*.  This will be long, but comprehensive, because you've shared a lot.  I'll also include a **very important disclaimer at the end.**

**1. Understanding What's Happening**

* **Core Value Clash:** You and your wife have fundamentally different orientations towards family.  She values it deeply; you understandably recoil from it due to your trauma. This isn't ""wrong"" on either side, but it *is* a significant source of conflict.  It sounds like this difference isn't just about holidays, but about how you both define support, obligation, and belonging.
* **Misinterpretation & Assumptions:** Her jumping to conclusions about your feelings speaks to a lack of genuine understanding. It could be she's projecting her own family expectations onto you, or she's not *asking* enough questions to truly understand your perspective. It's also possible she's insecure and interprets neutrality as negativity.
* **Trauma's Impact:** Your childhood trauma is *massively* impacting your present. Being abandoned, abused, and made homeless leaves deep scars. It's not surprising you've developed coping mechanisms – distance, perhaps a reluctance to rely on others, a strong independent streak. These are survival mechanisms, but they can hinder intimacy.
* **Father/Mother Dynamic:**  The situation with your father is adding fuel to the fire. His comments about your resemblance to your mother are deeply triggering, given your feelings towards her.  It's understandable that this makes you angry, and it highlights the unresolved pain around your parental relationships.
* **Escalation to Violence:**  This is the most critical issue.  Hitting each other is *never* okay.  It's a sign the conflict is spiraling out of control and you're both unable to regulate your emotions effectively in the moment.  This isn't about ""losing control"" as much as it is a pattern needing intervention.



**2. Why This Is Happening – A Deeper Dive**

* **Unprocessed Trauma:** You haven't fully processed the trauma of your past. This means the emotions are still raw, and triggers (like your father's comments) can lead to disproportionate reactions.  It also likely colors how you interpret your wife's actions – even neutral ones.
* **Communication Breakdown:**  You’re not communicating effectively.  It’s not just about *what* you say, but *how* you say it.  Are you able to express your needs and vulnerabilities without becoming defensive? Is your wife able to listen without interrupting or judging?
* **Different Love Languages:** You and your wife might express and experience love in different ways.  Knowing these can help bridge the gap.  (Look up ""5 Love Languages"" – it's a helpful starting point).
* **Unrealistic Expectations:** You might be expecting your wife to ""fix"" your pain, or she might be expecting you to fit into a family mold that doesn’t align with your experience.
* **Cycle of Conflict:**  Arguments build, feelings escalate, and eventually, it boils over into physical aggression. This cycle needs to be broken.



**3. What You Can DO – A Roadmap to Healing & Improvement**

This is a multi-pronged approach. It's not a quick fix.

**A. Immediate Safety & Separation (The Most Important Step)**

* **Separate Living Spaces:**  You *must* create physical space.  This is not a punishment; it's a safety measure.  Separate bedrooms, or even temporary living arrangements with friends/family, are necessary until you can address the violence.  Continuing to live together while resorting to physical aggression will only make things worse.
* **No Contact During Escalation:**  When you feel an argument brewing, *agree to a time-out*.  This means separate spaces, no communication, until you both have calmed down.  (e.g., ""I'm feeling overwhelmed. I need 30 minutes to cool down. Let's talk after that."")
* **Safety Plan:** If you fear for your safety or your wife's, have a safety plan. This includes knowing where to go, having emergency contacts, and potentially involving authorities if necessary.

**B. Individual Work (For Both of You – but you starting is vital)**

* **Therapy – *Absolutely Essential*:** You *need* individual therapy to process your trauma.  Look for a therapist specializing in trauma-informed",0.5516061186790466,7.906970245565226e-79,0.13700787401574802,0.26118442757376414
I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"The best way to move on is to give yourself sufficient time and space away from your ex so you can heal.  That means no checking out your ex on social media platforms and no contact.  In order to move on and diminish the obsessions, help yourself recognize and accept that the relationship is over, and make sure to get sufficient support in processing all your feelings.  Once that takes place, it can be useful to explore and process with a professional the meaning of the relationship and to understand your part in what transpired.Sometimes people obsess because they have difficulties accepting what's already taken place and want things to be different.  The key to moving forward is to be loving toward yourself, to give yourself permission to grieve the loss, and to start cultivating new and healthy habits/patterns.  Reengage in your present life, ask yourself what you want your life to look like, and start creating goals and taking small steps to create the amazing life you want for yourself.","Okay, this is *so* tough, and it's completely normal to be obsessing after a terrible breakup. It's a genuine loss, and your brain is trying to make sense of it.  It's good you're asking for help – that's a huge first step. Here's a breakdown of how to start moving on, broken down into sections, with a lot of detail.  I'll cover a lot, so feel free to focus on the parts that resonate most with you right now.  I'll also add a disclaimer at the end.

**1. Allow Yourself to Grieve (This is Crucial)**

*   **Feel the Feelings:**  Don't try to suppress or ""be strong"" right now.  Sadness, anger, confusion, regret – they *all* need to be felt.  Trying to push them down will only make them resurface later, often in unhealthier ways.  Cry if you need to, scream into a pillow, journal, whatever helps you *express* the pain.
*   **Time is Not a Cure, But It Helps:** People say ""time heals all wounds,"" and while it's not a simple fix, it's true in the sense that the intensity of the pain *will* lessen over time.  Right now, it feels all-consuming, but it won't forever.
*   **Validate Your Pain:**  Don't minimize your experience.  Even if others think the relationship wasn't ""that serious,"" your feelings are valid.  You cared, you invested, and now you're hurting.
*   **Grief is Not Linear:**  You'll have good days and bad days, even weeks after you think you're doing better.  Setbacks are normal.  Don't beat yourself up over them.  Just acknowledge them and gently redirect yourself back to self-care.
* **Journaling:** Write down your thoughts and feelings. Don't censor yourself. This can be a great way to process emotions and gain clarity.



**2.  Cut Contact (Seriously, This is Hard But Essential)**

*   **No Contact Rule:** This is the hardest part, but arguably the *most* important.  That means:
    *   **No texting, calling, emailing.**
    *   **No social media stalking.**  (Unfollow, mute, or even block if necessary.  This includes friends/family who constantly talk about them.)
    *   **No ""checking in"" through mutual friends.**
    *   **No driving by their house or workplace.**
    *   **No accidental ""run-ins"" (avoid places you know they frequent).**
*   **Why it Works:**  Every interaction, even a small one, re-opens the wound. It prevents you from detaching and moving on.  It gives you false hope.
*   **If *They* Reach Out:**  This is tough.  Ideally, no response.  If you absolutely *must* respond (e.g., logistical reasons like shared children or property), keep it brief, factual, and emotionally neutral.  Don't engage in conversation.
*  **Resist the urge to explain yourself:** You don't need to justify your no contact rule to them. 

**3.  Disrupt the Reminders**

*   **Physical Reminders:**  Pack away photos, gifts, anything that strongly reminds you of them.  You don't have to throw them away (unless you want to), but put them out of sight.  A box in the attic is fine.
*   **Digital Reminders:**
    *   Delete photos and videos from your phone and computer.
    *   Remove them from social media (unfriend, unfollow, mute).
    *   Delete old text messages or emails (or archive them if you're not ready to delete).
    *   Change shared playlists or streaming accounts.
*   **Environmental Reminders:**  If certain places remind you of them, avoid them for a while.  Change your routine.  Go to new restaurants, take different routes to work, etc.
* **Reclaim ""Your"" Things:**  Did you have hobbies or interests you gave up during the relationship?  Revisit them.  Reclaim your identity.

**4.  Focus on Self-Care (This Isn't Just Bubble Baths)**

*   **Basic Needs First:**  This is surprisingly important.  Are you eating regular, nutritious meals?  Are you getting enough sleep?  Are you drinking enough water?  When you're grieving, it's easy to neglect these things, but they are foundational to your well-being.
*   **Physical Activity:** Exercise is a *massive* mood booster.  It releases endorphins, reduces stress, and",0.5337507128715515,3.863626059099263e-155,0.11421628189550426,0.32289685424118075
How does a person start the counseling process?,The first thing to do is to reflect on what you want to seek counseling. Search online and then set up a phone consultation. A person can find out a lot about a counselor and the services that they offer over the phone. After a consultation then set up an intake questions. The overall goal is to make sure that you are comfortable with the counselor and the services they can offer.,"Okay, let's break down how a person can start the counseling process. It can feel daunting, but here's a comprehensive guide, covering everything from recognizing the need to attending that first session.  I'll categorize it into steps to make it easier to follow.

**1. Recognizing the Need & Initial Self-Reflection**

*   **Identify What's Going On:** This is the hardest part for many.  It's about acknowledging that something isn't right and that you could benefit from support. This could be anything from:
    *   **Specific Issues:** Anxiety, depression, grief, relationship problems, trauma, addiction, stress, anger management, eating disorders, etc.
    *   **General Feelings:**  Feeling overwhelmed, persistently sad or empty, stuck, having difficulty coping with life changes, experiencing low self-esteem, or a sense of unease you can't pinpoint.
    *   **Functional Impairment:**  Are these feelings/issues impacting your daily life?  Are you having trouble with work, school, relationships, sleep, appetite, or basic self-care?
*   **Self-Help First (Optional but Often Helpful):** Before diving into counseling, you might try some self-help strategies:
    *   **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings.
    *   **Mindfulness/Meditation:**  Practices to help you be present and manage stress.
    *   **Self-Care:**  Prioritizing activities that nourish you physically and emotionally (exercise, hobbies, spending time in nature, etc.).
    *   **Support System:** Talking to trusted friends or family (though this isn't a replacement for professional help if you need it).  Be mindful of *who* you talk to – you want someone supportive, not judgmental.
* **Understand that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.**  It takes courage to admit you need support.



**2. Finding a Counselor/Therapist**

This is where it gets practical.  There are a LOT of options.

*   **Types of Professionals:**  Knowing the different credentials can help.
    *   **Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC):**  Master's degree, supervised experience, and passed a licensing exam.  Often focuses on a wide range of mental health issues.
    *   **Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW):** Master's degree in social work, clinical experience, and licensing. Often focuses on the person within their environment and may connect you to resources.
    *   **Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT):** Master's degree, supervised experience, specializing in relationships and family dynamics.
    *   **Psychologist (PhD or PsyD):**  Doctoral degree.  Can provide therapy *and* psychological testing/assessment.  Often deal with more complex or severe mental health conditions.
    *   **Psychiatrist (MD):**  Medical doctor. Can prescribe medication *and* provide therapy (though often focuses more on medication management).
*   **Where to Look:**
    *   **Your Insurance Provider:**  *Start here if you have insurance!*  They'll have a list of in-network providers.  This will significantly reduce your out-of-pocket costs.  Look on their website or call their member services line.
    *   **Online Directories:**
        *   **Psychology Today:** ([https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists)) – Very popular and allows you to filter by location, insurance, issues, gender, etc.
        *   **GoodTherapy:** ([https://www.goodtherapy.org/](https://www.goodtherapy.org/)) -  Focuses on ethical and conscientious therapy.
        *   **Open Path Collective:** ([https://openpathcollective.org/](https://openpathcollective.org/)) - Offers affordable therapy options for those without insurance or with high deductibles (sliding scale fees).
    *   **Employee Assistance Program (EAP):**  Many employers offer a free, confidential EAP that provides a limited number of counseling sessions.
    *   **University Counseling Centers:** If you're a student, your university likely has a counseling center.
    *   **Community Mental Health Centers:**  Often offer services on a sliding scale based on income.
    *   **Referrals:** Ask your primary care doctor, friends, or family (if you're comfortable) for recommendations.
*   **Important Considerations When Choosing:**
    *   **Specialty:** Do they specialize in the issue you're facing (e.g., trauma, anxiety, couples counseling)?
    *   **Therapeutic Approach:** (See section 3 below)",0.4528685510158539,2.2612487710885397e-155,0.07228915662650603,0.23182564352233292
"I was in a relationship with a woman for four years. We both made mistakes, but I do love her.    She has moved in with another lady. I think she is just cheating on me to make me miss her. How can I find out for sure?","Has your former partner made any efforts to be in contact with you in order to restart your relationship?From what you describe, your former partner is in a new relationship.It is possible that since you love her and would like to be together again, that you are misinterpreting your former partner's actions.If you'd like to have more certainty as to wether your former partner is cheating or whether she is happy to be with the new partner, is to contact her and ask her your question.A better road may be to accept your sad feelings that she is with someone else.Since she was meaningful to you, respect the sadness you feel and that the relationship didn't continue as you wished.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling confused, hurt, and wanting to understand what's *really* going on. The feeling of ""is this real, or is this to make me jealous?"" is common in these circumstances.  However, it's important to approach this with a lot of caution and self-respect. Here's a breakdown of how to think about this, what you *can* do, and, importantly, what you *shouldn't* do, along with a focus on your well-being.

**First: Let's Address the Core Issue - Your Feelings and Assumptions**

* **It's okay to hurt:**  Four years is a significant investment.  It's normal to be deeply affected by this. Allow yourself to grieve the loss of the relationship, even if it's not definitively ""over"" yet.
* **The ""Making Me Miss Her"" Theory:** It's a natural defense mechanism to try and rationalize this in a way that preserves your hope, but it's also potentially dangerous.  It can keep you stuck in a limbo, hoping for something that might not be true, and preventing you from moving on.  It's good you're recognizing this thought, but don't base your actions on it *without* some reasonable grounding.
* **Focus on What *Is*, Not What *Might Be*:**  She has moved in with someone else. That is a concrete fact.  Regardless of her motivations, that action has consequences for you and your ability to have a relationship with her.
* **Acceptance (Even if it Hurts):**  The hardest part.  You need to start accepting the possibility that this is a genuine new relationship, and that your attempts to ""find out"" might not change that outcome.



**What You CAN Do (Carefully and Respectfully)**

These are listed in order of what I think is most healthy and productive.

1. **Direct Communication (The Most Difficult, But Often Best):** This is the hardest, but potentially the most clarifying.  This isn't about accusations, but about seeking clarity.  A possible approach:

   * **""I've been struggling with understanding the situation since you moved in with [her name]. I need to know, for my own peace of mind, if this is a committed relationship for you, or if there's something else going on.  I'm not trying to interfere, but I deserve honesty.""**
   * **Important:**  Prepare yourself for *any* answer.  Be ready for honesty you might not like.  Also, be prepared for her to *not* answer, or to give a vague answer.
   * **Keep it concise:** Don’t launch into a long emotional speech.
   * **Focus on ""I"" statements:** (""I need to understand,"" not ""You are doing this to..."")
   * **Do *not* do this via text.** A phone call is better, but in-person (if safe and possible) is best.  Avoid doing it when you're highly emotional.

2. **Observe Her Public Behavior (With Boundaries):**  This is *not* about stalking or obsessive checking. It's about noticing what's publicly visible.
   * **Social Media:**  (This is a tricky one - see ""What to AVOID"" below).  Are they posting photos together that suggest a couple?  Are they interacting in a way that looks romantic?  Don't read *too* much into this – people curate their online lives.
   * **Mutual Friends:**  If you have mutual friends, listen to what they say *without* prompting them for information.  Let them volunteer information if they want to.  Do *not* ask them to spy or get details for you.
   * **Be Realistic:**  People may be discreet.  The lack of public evidence doesn't necessarily mean anything.

3. **Accept Information from Her at Face Value (Initially):**  If she *does* tell you something, try to accept it at face value, at least initially.  Constantly questioning her will only drive her away and keep you stuck.  If her story changes repeatedly, *then* that's a red flag.

**What You Should ABSOLUTELY AVOID**

* **Stalking or Surveillance:** This is illegal and incredibly unhealthy.  Checking her location, driving by her house, hacking her accounts… these are all wrong and will likely make the situation worse.  It's a sign you're losing control.
* **Contacting the Other Woman:** This is almost always a bad idea. It's disrespectful to both of them, and it's unlikely to get you the answers you want.  It will likely escalate the drama.
* **Obs",0.5055316090583801,3.0281822859467296e-155,0.1027479091995221,0.24829351394560906
My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.,"You should start by speaking with her about what has her so down. Have their been some significant events in her life that have affected her? Have their been significant events in your relationship that can be affecting  you both? If she just stopped drinking, she may be struggling to finding an alternative and healthier behavior. This is something the two of you can explore together. Also, if need be perhaps she can speak to a therapist to discuss her feelings about quitting alcohol. It sounds like you really care and right now she could use all the support she can get despite her pushing you away.","Okay, this is a tough situation, and it's good you're reaching out for advice. It's a lot to navigate, with the sobriety, the depression, and the potential move. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, balancing supporting her with your own feelings, broken down into sections.  I'll cover understanding what's happening, how to support her, addressing the move, and taking care of yourself.  **Important Disclaimer at the end.**

**1. Understanding What's Happening**

* **Sobriety and Depression are Often Linked:**  This is *very* common. Alcohol often masks underlying depression or anxiety. When someone stops drinking, those feelings can surface, and often intensely. It's not that sobriety *caused* the depression, but rather that the mask is off.  Think of it like taking off a painkiller – the pain is still there, it was just suppressed.
* **Withdrawal vs. Depression:**  There's a difference. Early withdrawal can have depression-like symptoms.  But if she's been sober for a bit and the sadness/hopelessness persists, it's more likely to be genuine depression.
* **The Move Request:** The desire to move is likely *connected* to her depression. It's not necessarily about you or the relationship (though it could be a factor, we need to consider that). It could be a feeling of needing a fresh start, wanting to escape triggers, or a belief that a new environment will somehow ""fix"" things.  It's often a symptom of feeling overwhelmed and wanting control.
* **She Needs Professional Help:** This is key.  You can be supportive, but you are not a therapist.  Depression needs to be addressed by a professional.



**2. How to Support Her (Right Now)**

* **Listen, Validate, and Empathize:**  This is the most important thing.  Let her talk *without* interrupting, judging, or trying to ""fix"" things.  Say things like:
    * ""That sounds really hard.""
    * ""It makes sense that you're feeling this way.""
    * ""I'm here for you, no matter what.""
    * ""I can see you're really struggling.""
* **Encourage Professional Help (Gently but Firmly):**  This is crucial.  Suggest therapy.  Help her find resources (see resources section at the end).  Offer to go with her to the first appointment if she's anxious.  Say something like: ""I'm worried about you, and I think talking to a therapist could really help you process everything you're going through.""  Don't pressure, but consistently encourage.
* **Help with Practical Things:** Depression makes even simple tasks feel insurmountable.  Help with things like:
    * Grocery shopping
    * Cooking meals
    * Cleaning
    * Laundry
    * Scheduling appointments
* **Be Patient:** Recovery is not linear. There will be good days and bad days.  Avoid getting frustrated or taking her moods personally.
* **Focus on Self-Care *with* Her:** Encourage healthy habits. This could be:
    * Gentle exercise (walks, yoga)
    * Healthy eating
    * Getting enough sleep
    * Spending time in nature
    * Engaging in hobbies she used to enjoy (or trying new ones) – but don't push it if she's not up to it.

**3. Addressing the Move – This is Delicate**

* **Don't Immediately React with ""No! Stay!"":**  That will likely make her feel unheard and controlled. It will also likely fuel the desire to move.
* **Understand *Why* She Wants to Move:**  Ask open-ended questions:
    * ""What is it about moving that feels appealing to you right now?""
    * ""What do you hope would be different if we moved?""
    * ""What are you hoping to escape by moving?""
    * ""What does a new place represent for you?""
* **Explore Alternatives *Before* Agreeing or Disagreeing:**  Could some of her needs be met *without* moving?  For example:
    * **If she wants a fresh start:** Could you redecorate a room?  Take a weekend trip?  Start a new activity together?
    * **If she's avoiding triggers:** Can you identify and minimize those triggers in your current environment?
    * **If she feels stuck:**  Could you both explore new hobbies or social circles?
* **Be Honest About Your Feelings:**  Tell her you want her to stay, but *after* you've listened to her reasons.  ""I love you, and I really enjoy our life together. I'm worried about how a move would impact us, and I'",0.4733021557331085,4.7859234735232424e-79,0.10230179028132992,0.2846489060020293
"I'm feeling rejected and frustrated. This is not new. The first month we were together, sex was about every day. Then it slowed down to once a month right away. I love my husband, but I am struggling with this.","   Feeling rejected and frustrated is a reasonable reaction to your experience with your husband. I want to encourage you that his actions may have little to do with you, and regardless of outcomes, I hope you find the help you need to process through your pain and still have hope for your marriage.   If your husband was to work with me I'd explore with him his understanding of, and experience with, intimacy in relationship with others. Furthermore, like other male clients of mine, I'd challenge your husband to secure an updated full medical exam from his PCP (primary care physician) and/or urologist in order to identify or rule out any organic issues which may be causing his apparent lack of desire for sexual intimacy. If there are no physical issues, per se, I would encourage your husband to process further his family of origin story-line regarding rules, roles, sex, and sexuality along with working through his sexual and trauma histories. ","Okay, this sounds really difficult. It's completely understandable that you're feeling rejected and frustrated. A significant shift in intimacy like that, especially so early in a relationship, is bound to be painful and confusing. It's good you recognize you love him, because that gives you a foundation to work from, but it doesn't negate the validity of your feelings *right now*. Let's break this down and talk about how to approach it.  I'll cover understanding what might be happening, how to cope with your feelings, and how to communicate with your husband.

**1. Understanding What Might Be Going On (It's Rarely About You)**

The biggest thing to remember is that a sudden drop in sexual frequency rarely has *only* one cause, and it's very, very often **not** about your desirability or anything you're doing ""wrong."" Here are some possibilities to consider.  I'm listing a lot, because it's helpful to brainstorm.  You and your husband will need to explore what resonates (or doesn't) with *him*:

*   **New Relationship Energy Fades:** The intense initial phase is fueled by novelty, hormones, and a lot of excitement. It's not sustainable for most people.  While a drop is normal, going *that* quickly to once a month is still a significant change.
*   **Stress:** Is he under a lot of stress at work, with family, financially, or with his health? Stress is a huge libido killer.
*   **Underlying Health Issues:** Physical health problems (diabetes, high blood pressure, hormonal imbalances, chronic pain, etc.) can impact sexual desire and function.  He might be embarrassed to talk about these.
*   **Medications:**  Many medications have side effects that reduce libido.
*   **Psychological Factors:**  Anxiety, depression, past trauma, body image issues, or even just general mental fatigue can all play a role.
*   **Performance Anxiety:**  Perhaps the initial pressure to ""perform"" during the frequent early stage created anxiety that he's now avoiding.
*   **Different Libidos:** You simply may have naturally different levels of sexual desire. This doesn't mean you're incompatible, but it requires understanding and compromise.
*   **Unspoken Expectations:** Did he feel pressured during the first month?  Did he feel like he was initiating more than he wanted to?
*   **Changes in Feelings (Not Necessarily Negative):** Sometimes, as people get to know each other, the *type* of connection changes. He might be shifting towards wanting more emotional intimacy and less purely physical intimacy. This isn't necessarily a rejection of *you*, but a shift in what he's needing.
* **Pornography Use:** While a sensitive topic, increased pornography use can sometimes contribute to lowered libido and unrealistic expectations in real-life intimacy.



**2. Coping With Your Feelings (Self-Care is Crucial)**

Before you even talk to your husband, take care of yourself. Your feelings are valid, and you need to process them:

*   **Acknowledge Your Pain:** Don't minimize how you're feeling.  It's okay to be sad, frustrated, and rejected. Allow yourself to feel those emotions.
*   **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be incredibly therapeutic.
*   **Self-Compassion:**  Be kind to yourself.  This isn't your fault.  Remind yourself of your worth and desirability.
*   **Distraction & Activities You Enjoy:** Engage in hobbies, spend time with friends, exercise, read, or do anything that brings you joy and takes your mind off things *temporarily*.  This isn't about ignoring the problem, but about maintaining your well-being.
* **Consider Therapy (For Yourself):**  A therapist can provide a safe space to explore your feelings, develop coping mechanisms, and prepare for a conversation with your husband. Even a few sessions can be incredibly helpful.



**3. Communicating With Your Husband (The Most Important Step)**

This is the hardest part, but it's essential. Here's how to approach the conversation:

*   **Choose the Right Time and Place:**  Pick a time when you're both relaxed, not tired or stressed, and have privacy.  Avoid bringing it up during or after an attempt at intimacy.
*   **""I"" Statements:**  Focus on how *you* feel, not on what he's doing ""wrong.""  For example, instead of saying ""You never want to have sex anymore,"" say ""I've been feeling really disconnected and sad lately because our physical intimacy has decreased so much.""
*   **Be Specific:**  Mention the shift you noticed. ""I remember when we first started dating, we were intimate almost every day, and",0.5247089266777039,0.012713376193455422,0.10896708286038591,0.25801954792028053
"My daughter didn't see her biological father for the last three years. She doesn’t want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse. The visitation is with supervision, but she refuses to see him. Is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy?","Hi Dillon,I'm from Canada, so I don't know the laws in your state. It depends on that a good deal, perhaps. In my opinion, a child should never be forced into a situation where they feel unsafe, even if it is ""supervised"". If the child is old enough to make a strong statement about not wanting to see a parent, then this should be honoured. Unfortunately, the laws don't always uphold a parent's right to do what is best for their child. I recommend you see a lawyer, who will advise you about how to proceed without putting yourself at risk of breaching custody agreements.If you feel your daughter can benefit from therapy, that is a separate question. Or is she already in therapy? A family therapist will typically meet with you alone first, in order to determine if therapy is a wise move for your child. It isn't always appropriate.","Okay, this is a really sensitive and important situation. It's absolutely right of you to prioritize your daughter's feelings and well-being. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, focusing on what's best for her, and why therapy is crucial.  I'll cover a lot of ground, so it's a long response, but hopefully comprehensive. **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am not a legal or medical professional.**

**1. Validate Her Feelings – Absolutely First and Foremost**

*   **Believe her:** The most important thing is to believe your daughter's memories and feelings. Don't minimize what she experienced, even if it's difficult to hear.  Statements like ""That sounds really scary,"" or ""It's okay to feel this way,"" are powerful.
*   **Acknowledge her courage:**  Refusing to see someone who has harmed her takes immense courage.  Tell her you're proud of her for knowing her boundaries and for speaking up about what she needs.
*   **Reinforce her safety:**  Let her know, repeatedly, that *you* are there to protect her, and that you will not force her to do anything that makes her feel unsafe.  This is paramount.
* **Don't speak negatively about her refusal:** Even if *you* feel conflicted about the situation (and you likely are!), avoid saying things like ""You *should* try,"" or ""It would be good for him if you saw him.""  Her needs come first.



**2. Therapy is Essential – And Should Come *Before* Any Attempts at Visitation**

You are absolutely on the right track thinking about therapy. Here's why it's so critical, and what kind of therapy is most helpful:

*   **Processing Trauma:**  Experiences like domestic violence and child abuse are deeply traumatic.  A therapist specializing in trauma can help her process these memories in a safe and controlled environment.  This isn't about ""getting over it,"" but about learning to cope with the impact of those experiences.
*   **Developing Coping Mechanisms:** Therapy can equip her with tools to manage anxiety, fear, and other emotions that arise when thinking about her father.
*   **Building Boundaries:**  A therapist can help her understand and reinforce healthy boundaries.  This is crucial, especially in the context of supervised visitation, where boundaries might be tested.
*   **Empowerment:** Therapy can help her feel empowered and in control of her own life and decisions.  She needs to understand that she has a voice and that her feelings matter.
*   **Understanding Visitation:** A therapist can help her explore *why* she feels the way she does about visitation, and what her fears are.  This can be done *without* any pressure to actually visit.
*   **Trauma-Informed Therapy:**  Specifically look for a therapist who is trained in trauma-informed care.  Approaches like Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), or play therapy (if she's young) can be very effective.

**Important:**  Let *her* have a say in choosing the therapist, if possible.  Finding someone she feels comfortable with is essential.  A child therapist is ideal.




**3.  The Role of the Court/Legal Order (Supervised Visitation)**

*   **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed record of your daughter's statements about why she doesn't want to visit, and any reactions she has to the idea of visitation. This documentation could be crucial if you need to petition the court.
*   **Consult with a Family Law Attorney:**  You *absolutely* need to speak with a family law attorney in your jurisdiction.  They can advise you on your rights and options, and explain how the court views a child's refusal to visit.  
*   **Petition the Court:**  Based on your attorney's advice, you may need to petition the court to modify or terminate the visitation order, given your daughter’s trauma and her expressed wishes.  The court *should* prioritize the child's well-being.  The attorney can help you present the evidence (therapy reports, your documentation, potentially your daughter's statement to the court – handled carefully by the attorney).
* **The ""Best Interests of the Child"":** Courts generally operate under the principle of ""the best interests of the child.""  A child's legitimate fear and trauma are significant factors in determining what is in their best interest.




**4.  Regarding Re-introducing Visitation (If/When)**

*   **Do *Not* Force It:**  Under no circumstances should you force your daughter to see her father.  This can be re-traumatizing and further damage your relationship with her.
*   **Therapist-Guided Approach",0.5305229425430298,3.4081200765376313e-155,0.1037204058624577,0.29071953833870123
"I have had a crush on this guy for years. I last talked to him a few years ago when we graduated from high school. We left off on a good note. Should I message him and see how he is doing, or is it too late?","You'll only find out whether or not it is ""too late"", by following through with wanting to message him.Regardless of whether the response you receive is what you'd hoped to hear, including not hearing back from him, you will have done yourself a great honor and respect by following through on a wish and curiosity you've had for some time.","Okay, this is a classic and totally relatable situation! It's *definitely* not automatically too late. Years can pass, and people reconnect all the time. Here's a breakdown of things to consider, and a plan of action, broken down into sections to help you decide and approach it:

**1. Is it ""Too Late""? Let's Deconstruct That.**

*   **No hard and fast rule:** There's no expiration date on a crush, or on reaching out to someone you used to know.
*   **""Too late"" depends on *your* expectations:**  Are you hoping to immediately pick things up romantically? That might be a bigger ask and need a more careful approach. If you just want to reconnect as friends, it's much less pressure.
*   **Positive History:** You said you left things on a good note. That's *huge*. That removes a lot of potential awkwardness.  No unresolved drama is a massive win.
*   **His Current Situation (Unknown):** This is the biggest unknown. He might be in a relationship, focused on his career, living in a different country...  You don't know!  But that doesn't mean you *can't* find out.



**2. Assess Your Motivations - Be Honest With Yourself**

Before you message, really think about *why* you want to reach out.

*   **Curiosity:** Do you just genuinely want to know how he's doing? That's a perfectly valid reason.
*   **Hoping for More:** Are you secretly hoping this could lead to something romantic? It's okay if the answer is yes, but be aware of this.  It will influence how you approach the conversation.
*   **Filling a Void:** Are you feeling lonely or nostalgic and projecting onto him?  It's good to address those feelings separately so you aren't putting unfair pressure on a reconnection.
* **Closure:** Are you trying to get closure? While reconnecting could *provide* closure, don't lead with that intention. It can put him on the defensive.

Understanding your motivations will help you manage your expectations and craft a message that feels authentic.

**3. Crafting the Message - Key Principles**

*   **Keep it Casual & Low Pressure:** This is the most important thing.  Avoid anything that sounds intense or desperate.
*   **Acknowledge the Time:**  Don't pretend like no time has passed. Acknowledging it makes it feel more natural.
*   **Reference a Shared Memory (Optional):** This can be a nice touch, but don't force it.
*   **Open-Ended Question:**  Ask a question that requires more than a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer.
*   **Don't Overthink It:** Seriously. A few sentences are enough.

**Here are a few example messages, tailored to different levels of risk/intention:**

*   **Option 1: Super Casual - Just Checking In (Lowest Risk)**

   ""Hey [His Name]! It's [Your Name].  It feels like ages since graduation! Just popped into my head wondering how you've been. Hope life is treating you well!""

*   **Option 2: A Bit More Personal - Remembering a Shared Experience**

   ""Hey [His Name], [Your Name] here.  I was just thinking about [shared memory - e.g., that crazy history class, the graduation party] the other day and it made me wonder how you're doing.  Anything exciting happening?""

*   **Option 3:  Slightly More Engaging - Asking About His Interests (If you know something about his interests)**

   ""Hey [His Name]!  It's [Your Name].  I remember you were really into [his hobby/interest] back in high school.  Are you still doing that?  Just curious to see what you've been up to.""

**Important Don'ts:**

*   **Don't apologize for reaching out:** You're not bothering him.
*   **Don't unload your life story:** Keep it concise.
*   **Don't ask about his relationship status right away:** Let that come up naturally, if at all.
*   **Don't mention your crush (yet):** This is a reconnection, not a confession.



**4. What to Expect (and How to Handle It)**

*   **He Might Not Respond:** This is a possibility, and it's okay. People are busy, or they may not be in a place to reconnect. Don't take it personally. Give it a reasonable amount of time (a week or so) before assuming he won't.
*   **He Might Respond, But Be Polite & Distant",0.4613194167613983,1.6494410028421454e-155,0.06199460916442048,0.1870844299501291
"My parents seem okay with other sexualities, but normally they only talk about being gay. When they do talk about bisexuality, they say things like “they'll do anything” or things that make me very uncomfortable because I am bisexual. I don't know if I am ready to come out to them.","Perhaps you are not ready to come out to your parents.  Often times our readiness is not dependent on what others' will say or how they react. But more so dependent on how emotionally prepared we are to deal with others' reactions.  It may be beneficial for you to play out each possible scenario and conclusion (eg. your parents being supportive vs. your parents being disappointed and so on). How are you prepared to deal with the outcome?  You may also seek help through counselors, support groups and/or individuals you know that have dealt with similar situations to help you prepare to discuss this with your parents.  All the best!","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's completely understandable why you're feeling uncomfortable and hesitant about coming out. It sounds like your parents are operating from a place of limited understanding and some potentially harmful stereotypes, even if they *think* they're being accepting. Here's a breakdown of what's going on, and how you can navigate this, along with things to consider about coming out:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Monogay-centric View:** Many people, even allies, fall into the trap of thinking of LGBTQ+ identities as solely gay or lesbian. This is called ""monogayism."" They may have focused their learning and understanding on those identities and haven't broadened it to include the spectrum of experiences within bisexuality, pansexuality, etc.
* **Harmful Stereotypes:**  The things your parents are saying (""they'll do anything"") are *incredibly* damaging stereotypes. They perpetuate the idea that bisexual people are promiscuous, indecisive, or less committed than people in monogamous relationships. This is untrue and hurtful. It's rooted in biphobia.
* **Invalidation:** Even if they don’t *mean* to be invalidating, their limited understanding and these kinds of comments can make you feel like your identity isn’t taken seriously or is seen as a ""phase"" or something less legitimate.
* **Your Safety and Wellbeing:** Your hesitation to come out is *completely valid*. You're sensing a potential for negativity and a lack of understanding, and it's smart to protect yourself.



**What You Can Do (Without Coming Out - For Now)**

These are options to test the waters and potentially educate them, without fully revealing your own bisexuality.  Choose what feels safest and most comfortable for you.

* **Subtle Education:**  When the topic comes up, try gently offering different perspectives.  For example:
    * **Parent:** ""They'll do anything.""
    * **You:**  ""Actually, bisexuality is about attraction to more than one gender.  It doesn't mean someone is more likely to be unfaithful.  Commitment and relationships are about the people involved, not their sexuality."" (Saying this calmly and matter-of-factly can be effective).
    * **Share Articles/Media:**  ""I read an interesting article about bisexuality and how common those stereotypes are.  I can send it to you if you'd like."" (Choose reputable sources – see resources at the end).
    * **Highlight Positive Representation:** ""Did you see that [celebrity/character] came out as bi? It's cool to see more representation.""
* **Focus on the Harm of Stereotypes:**  You can talk about *why* those kinds of statements are harmful in general, without revealing you're bisexual.  ""I heard someone say something similar about [another group], and it just felt really unfair and based on assumptions.""
* **Shift the Conversation:** When they start to make those kinds of comments, gently change the subject.  This can signal that you're not comfortable with the topic.
* **Limit Exposure (Temporarily):** If their comments are consistently hurtful, it's okay to limit how much you discuss LGBTQ+ topics with them for a while.  Protect your emotional energy.

**Thinking About Coming Out - Things to Consider**

Coming out is a deeply personal decision, and there's no right or wrong time. Here's a checklist of things to think about:

* **Your Safety:**  This is the *most* important thing.  Are you financially dependent on them?  Do you live with them?  Would coming out potentially put you at risk of emotional, verbal, or physical harm?  If so, it may be best to wait.
* **Your Emotional Readiness:** Are you comfortable and confident in your own identity?  Do you have a support system (friends, other family members, a therapist) who can support you?
* **Their Potential Reaction:**  Based on what you've observed, what's the *most likely* reaction?  Are they generally open-minded people, even if they're misinformed? Or are they more rigid in their beliefs?  Prepare yourself for a range of responses.
* **What You Want From Coming Out:**  What are your expectations?  Do you want their full acceptance and support?  Or are you simply wanting to be honest with them?  Lowering your expectations can sometimes make the process easier.  (It’s okay if they need time to adjust).
* **You Don't Owe Anyone an Explanation:** You are not obligated to come out to anyone until *you* are ready.  It's your information to share when and if you choose.



**If You *Do* Decide to Come Out:**",0.48788896203041077,0.008464064766306607,0.09696969696969697,0.20348837209302326
"I've been going through a rough time lately. I been into nothing but women. I’ve never thought about men until a week ago. I’m very upset and depressed about this. It's not normal to me. I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that I’m not gay. I get the same results each time, and I feel disgust. This is tough on me. I'm scared that I looked too many times. I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.","Hello. Coming to terms with the idea that you might be of a sexuality other than the one in which you were socially raised to be, can be emotionally disturbing, and quite unsettling. It creates anxiety, maybe even panic, and leaves us feeling confused and uncertain about our own sense of identity. It becomes important to first ask yourself how you feel when you are thinking of being intimate with guys, or if you desire them to be intimate with you. It is important to know what impact this has on you, because it can determine your level of follow through and desire in pursuing sexual activity with someone of the same sex. I am not going to pass judgment on you either way - even for having the thoughts. I have worked with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) community in various ways over the years. Many I speak to, say they had to struggle to come to terms with this awareness about how they see themselves sexually. Maybe you are bisexual, and don't have an exclusive attraction to the same sex. You might consider doing some searches online for community support groups in your area, to explore the feelings and issues around this topic. Talking to someone who you trust can be helpful too. Running from your feelings is not a good idea, and others in a support group for sexuality issues, might be able to relate to you and what you're going through right now. This will offer you perspective, as you think on how this plays out in your life.Counselors are typically well trained to provide clinical services to clients who are experiencing feelings and thoughts much like the ones you are having now. I encourage you to consider reaching out for help. You are not crazy or insane for thinking of working with a counselor, nor of having feelings of same sex attraction. If you decide you are indeed gay, then know that you are not alone and never will be alone in that feeling. There is a huge community of support for you. Additionally, we all need help sometimes dealing with all sort of issues. A counselor can work more in depth with you to examine the motivations behind the feelings, and help you come to terms with them more directly. I hope that you come to a place where you feel less alone and more secure with yourself as you examine this area of your life. No matter what, do not fear being yourself. Again...you are not alone, I promise.Warm regards,Shawn Berthel, M.S., LMHC","Okay, this sounds incredibly distressing, and it's really brave of you to reach out and talk about it. It's clear you're experiencing a lot of internal conflict and emotional turmoil. Let's break down what you're saying and then talk about how to navigate this.  I'm going to offer a lot of information, so please take your time reading it.  I will also include a disclaimer at the end, as I am an AI and cannot provide therapy.

**First, let's address the core feelings:**

* **Distress and Depression:** You're understandably feeling down and upset.  Experiencing something that challenges your long-held beliefs about yourself is *very* difficult, and it's okay to feel depressed as a result.
* **Confusion and Fear:**  You've identified a new attraction that's unexpected, and that's scary.  The fear comes from not understanding it, and potentially from societal pressures or internalised beliefs about what's ""normal.""
* **Disgust:** You mention feeling disgust after looking at gay pornography. This is *extremely* common, and doesn't automatically mean you're gay. It often means you're grappling with internal conflict and discomfort with these new feelings.  Disgust can be a reaction to anything that clashes with your established understanding of yourself.
* **Anxiety & Physical Symptoms:**  The shaking and intrusive thoughts are signs of significant anxiety.  Your mind is stuck in a loop, trying to process something it doesn't understand.
* **Guilt/Fear about Looking:** You're worried about having looked at the pornography, framing it as if the act itself is the problem.  This is important to unpack (more on that below).



**Let's talk about why what you're experiencing is more common than you think:**

* **Sexuality is Fluid:**  The understanding of sexuality is evolving. It's no longer seen as a fixed, rigid thing. Many people experience fluidity in their attraction throughout their lives.  This means attraction can shift and change, and it's not necessarily an ""either/or"" situation.  You've *always* been attracted to women, and now you're recognizing *additional* attraction, which is different than a complete switch.
* **Late-Onset Attraction:**  It's perfectly possible to discover attraction to the same sex later in life.  There's no timeline for when these feelings ""should"" emerge.  Life experiences, personal growth, and simply becoming more open to different possibilities can all play a role.
* **Curiosity vs. Orientation:**  Looking at pornography, even if it's something new, doesn't define your sexual orientation.  Curiosity is a normal human trait.  Many straight people explore different things out of curiosity, and that doesn't automatically change their orientation. *However*, the way you *feel* while doing so is significant (and you're already noticing that – the disgust).
* **Internalized Homophobia:**  This is a big one.  If you grew up in an environment that subtly or overtly conveyed negative messages about homosexuality, you may have internalized those beliefs.  This means you've absorbed those messages and now apply them to yourself, leading to shame, guilt, and self-criticism. *This is often the source of the disgust you're feeling, not the attraction itself.*

**Why trying to ""prove"" you're not gay is counterproductive:**

You mentioned looking at gay porn to ""prove"" you're not gay. This is a very common, but ultimately unhelpful, response.  It's a form of reassurance-seeking, and it rarely works.  Here's why:

* **It reinforces the idea that being gay is something negative.** You're approaching this as if it's something to be avoided, which feeds your anxiety.
* **It focuses on behavior instead of feelings.**  Attraction is about *how you feel*, not what you look at.
* **It's a flawed experiment.**  Your emotional state *while* looking is more important than the act itself.  If it makes you feel disgusted, that tells you something about your internal conflict, not your orientation.
* **It can create a cycle of anxiety.**  You look, feel bad, and then feel compelled to look again to try and get a different result.




**What can you do?**

1. **Stop the ""Testing"":**  Immediately stop trying to ""prove"" or ""disprove"" your orientation. This is fueling your anxiety.  Avoid deliberately seeking out pornography (of any kind) for a while, at least until you've started to process your feelings.
2. **Self-Compassion:**  Be kind to yourself. You're going through something challenging, and it's okay to be confused and upset.",0.5602848529815674,0.023724564561386365,0.15911035072711718,0.2765583510499119
"I have known her for years. She was dating my brother-in-law when we met. My kids think of her as their aunt. On Halloween 2014, I lost my mom to cancer. My mom and dad were still married when she passed away. My friend was there for me through that and my own cancer diagnosis. She has been a very big part of both me and my kids’ life, but now last month, my dad told me that he really likes my friend and wants to marry her. She’s like a sister to me. My kids hate the idea.","How are you measuring whether or not your dad understands your wish?Your dad understanding your wish does not mean he will necessarily follow through with what you want.Based on what you describe about your relationship to the woman in question, your discomfort with the idea of your dad marrying your friend, is reasonable.Have the conversation with your dad that includes your viewpoint, and also ask him for his impression of your feelings.Its even possible he already has considered your feelings and hasn't yet told you.It is also possible that a conversation on the subject, as well as your dad following through with his decision to marry your best friend, may develop in a very positive way.Part of the current uneasiness you feel may be from fear of how a change in circumstances and introducing new relationship dynamics might feel.Given that the person who died was your mom, maybe your emotions are not yet ready seeing your dad with a replacement spouse. Try to see the situation from the point of everyone, including yourself, who is involved in this major change.  Maybe having a family discussion about acceptance and readiness to accept a new partner for your dad, would open new empathy for all of these family members.","Okay, this is *incredibly* complicated and understandably painful. You're navigating a minefield of emotions and relationships, and it's good you're acknowledging how deeply unsettling this is. Here's a breakdown of the issues, how to think about them, and some suggestions for how to move forward, broken down into sections.  I'll try to cover a lot of ground, knowing you'll need to pick and choose what resonates.

**1. The Core Conflicts – Let's Name Them**

* **Betrayal (or Perceived Betrayal):** You feel betrayed by both your dad *and* your friend. Your dad is pursuing a relationship with someone you consider family. Your friend, knowing your feelings, is seemingly willing to go along with it. This hits a deep level of loyalty and familial expectation.
* **Grief Complicated:**  The timing is exceptionally difficult, coming after the loss of your mom. Your dad finding happiness is, logically, something to *want* for him. But the *way* he's finding it, and with *her*, feels like a violation of your grief and the memory of your mother. It's bringing up those feelings of loss all over again.
* **Family Dynamics Disrupted:** The established family structure is being fundamentally altered.  Your kids' ""aunt"" is now potentially becoming your stepmother.  That's a huge shift that's understandably upsetting for them.
* **Loyalty Bind:** You are torn between your love for your father, your friendship with her, and your responsibility to your children. You don’t want to hurt anyone, but someone *will* be hurt.
* **Role Confusion & Boundary Issues:** The lines have blurred significantly.  This person has occupied a ""family-like"" role for years, and now she's transitioning into a romantic partner with your father.



**2. Understanding Your Dad's Perspective (Though it Doesn't Make It Easier)**

It’s vital to try (even if it’s incredibly hard) to understand *why* your dad is doing this, even if you don't agree with it. 

* **Loneliness:** Losing your mom was devastating for him. He's likely deeply lonely and seeking companionship.
* **Comfort & Familiarity:** He's known her for years. There's a level of comfort and ease in being with someone he already has a connection with, especially someone who has been supportive during difficult times.
* **He's Allowed to Seek Happiness:**  It's important to remember that your dad is an individual with his own needs and desires. He has a right to find love and companionship, even if it feels wrong to you. (This doesn’t mean you *have* to accept it, just acknowledge it.)

However, *his* right to happiness doesn't negate *your* feelings, or the impact this has on your family.



**3. Understanding Your Friend's Perspective (And Setting Boundaries)**

This is the most difficult part. Her motivations are likely complex.

* **Genuine Feelings:** She may genuinely have feelings for your dad. It's possible these feelings have developed over time.
* **Comfort & Support:**  She may feel a strong connection to your dad based on shared experiences and the support they provided each other during tough times.
* **Awareness of the Situation:** She *must* be aware of the delicate situation. Her willingness to proceed suggests she's weighing her own happiness against the potential fallout.
* **You need to talk to her.**  This conversation will be incredibly difficult, but it's essential.  You need to express how this feels to you – the betrayal, the disruption, the pain. Don't accuse, but use ""I"" statements: ""I feel hurt that you would consider this, knowing how close we are,"" or ""I'm struggling with the idea of you becoming my stepmother.""  Be prepared for her to defend her actions, but stand your ground in expressing your feelings.
* **You may need to create distance.** This is painful, but if she proceeds with the relationship, you might need to protect yourself and your children by limiting contact.  You can't force her to change her mind, and you need to prioritize your own well-being.

**4. Addressing Your Children's Feelings**

This is paramount.  They are grieving the loss of the ""aunt"" they know, and bracing for a major family upheaval.

* **Validate Their Feelings:** Don't dismiss their anger, sadness, or confusion.  Let them know it's okay to feel however they're feeling.  Say things like, ""I understand why you're upset.  This is a big change, and it's okay to be angry/sad/confused.""
* **Age-Appropriate Explanation:** Explain",0.5372957587242126,0.014494190377156284,0.13066385669125394,0.2798581001182499
"I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year and a half. He loves me a lot, and I love him. It hurts to be apart from him for so long. It hurts all over, and then I feel like it won't last.",I would suggest that you look up the word codependency and it's characteristics.  See if you relate to those characteristics.  I have a feeling  you have suffered some form of loss in your life that you have not dealt with properly.  For some reason you are depending on your boyfriend to fill that loss.  Considering working with a counseling to work through your emotions and resolve any lingering issues.,"Okay, it sounds like you're experiencing a really common and really valid struggle in a relationship - the pain of separation combined with anxieties about the future. It's good you recognize these feelings and are acknowledging them. Let's break this down and explore some things going on, and then talk about some coping strategies.

**What's likely happening here:**

* **Attachment and Secure Base:** After a year and a half, you've likely developed a strong attachment to your boyfriend. He's become your secure base - the person you turn to for comfort, support, and reassurance. When that base is removed (even temporarily), it's *natural* to feel destabilized, anxious, and even physically uncomfortable. That ""hurt all over"" feeling is very real and speaks to that deep connection.
* **Separation Anxiety:** This is closely linked to attachment. It’s not necessarily pathological (like a clinical anxiety disorder), but the feelings are similar: worry about his well-being while apart, a sense of incompleteness, and difficulty focusing on other things.
* **Fear of Loss/Relationship Doubts:**  The feeling that it ""won't last"" often emerges *because* of the pain of separation.  Your brain might be trying to ""protect"" you from future hurt by suggesting the relationship isn't strong enough to withstand the distance. It's a negative thought pattern, but a common one. Distance can amplify existing insecurities.
* **Missing the Routine & Shared Experiences:** A year and a half builds a lot of shared routines, inside jokes, and comfortable habits. Missing those everyday things can feel significant.
* **Individual Coping Styles:** How *you* typically deal with stress and emotional discomfort plays a role. If you tend to ruminate or are prone to anxiety, these feelings can be stronger.



**Let's explore this a bit further - could you tell me a little more about...**

* **How long is ""so long""?** Is this a week, a month, indefinite? Knowing the timeframe helps understand the intensity of the feelings.
* **What's causing the separation?** Work, school, family obligations, travel?  The reason for the distance matters.  Is it temporary and with a clear end date, or is it more open-ended?
* **How do you usually communicate while apart?**  Frequent calls, texts, video chats?  The quality and consistency of communication are crucial.
* **What specifically triggers the thought ""it won't last""?** Is it when he's busy and doesn't respond immediately? When you see other couples together?  Identifying the triggers is important.
* **What do *you* do when you're feeling this way?** Do you distract yourself, talk to friends, withdraw, etc.?




**Here are some things you can *try* to cope, regardless of the specifics (and we can tailor them once I know more):**

**1. Validate Your Feelings:**  The first and most important step.  Don't tell yourself you *shouldn't* feel this way.  Say to yourself, ""It's okay that I'm feeling sad and anxious about being apart from him. It means I care deeply about him.""  Self-compassion is key.

**2. Schedule Consistent Communication:**
   * **Quality over Quantity:**  Don’t just aim for constant contact, but for *meaningful* connection.  A 30-minute video call where you really talk is better than 100 texts.
   * **Scheduled Dates:** Plan ""dates"" – watch a movie ""together"" (starting it at the same time), cook the same meal, read the same book.
   * **Regular Check-Ins:**  Agree on a regular time to check in and share how you’re both doing.

**3. Focus on Your Own Life:** This is HUGE.  The more you can fill your time with things you enjoy, the less overwhelming the separation will feel.
   * **Hobbies:** Revisit old hobbies or try new ones.
   * **Socialize:** Spend time with friends and family.
   * **Personal Goals:** Work towards your own goals – career, fitness, learning something new.  This builds your confidence and sense of self.
   * **Self-Care:** Prioritize activities that help you relax and recharge (exercise, meditation, reading, taking baths, etc.).

**4. Challenge Negative Thoughts:**  When you have the thought ""it won't last,"" actively challenge it.
   * **Evidence:** What evidence supports that thought? What evidence contradicts it?  (Think about all the good times you've had, how well you communicate, his demonstrated love for you.)
   * **Reframe:** Reframe the thought. Instead of ""It won't last,"" try ""Being apart is hard",0.4639493525028229,1.881092192746836e-155,0.062095730918499355,0.19470404984423678
Does counseling really do anything that can help people?,Counseling can go a long way in improving your mental health. Counseling helps you to get new perspective on your life and problems.Talking about your problems with a counselor gives them substances and something to get a handle on. Talking about your problems gives you a chance look at your situation from a new angle to help solve your problems.The counselor is a neutral listener that can help give direction and answers to your needs.Counseling can help you solve your problems but also can set up a plan for the future. Counseling can help you to deal with things before they get out of hand.Give counseling a try.,"Okay, let's break down whether counseling really helps people. It's a really valid question, and the answer is complex, but overwhelmingly **yes, counseling can be incredibly helpful for a lot of people**. However, it's not a magic bullet, and its effectiveness depends on many factors. Here's a detailed look, covering the evidence, what it helps with, how it works, and what impacts its success.

**1. The Evidence: What Does Research Say?**

*   **Extensive Research Support:**  There's a *huge* body of research supporting the effectiveness of counseling (also often referred to as psychotherapy).  Meta-analyses (studies that combine the results of many other studies) consistently show that counseling is more effective than no treatment for a wide range of mental health issues.
*   **Effect Sizes:**  The *effect size* (how much better people do with therapy vs. without) isn't always huge, but it's generally considered clinically significant.  This means that while it might not ""cure"" everyone, it often leads to noticeable and meaningful improvements in people's lives.  It's often compared to the effectiveness of medical treatments for physical conditions – it's rarely a perfect fix, but it can make a significant difference.
*   **Specific Conditions:** Research has demonstrated effectiveness for:
    *   **Depression:**  Counseling is a cornerstone treatment for depression, often alongside (or sometimes instead of) medication.
    *   **Anxiety Disorders:**  (Generalized Anxiety, Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety, Phobias) – Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is particularly effective here.
    *   **Trauma & PTSD:**  Specialized therapies like EMDR and Trauma-Focused CBT are highly regarded.
    *   **Relationship Issues:** Couples counseling and family therapy can improve communication and resolve conflicts.
    *   **Addiction:**  Counseling is a vital part of addiction recovery, helping with coping mechanisms and addressing underlying issues.
    *   **Eating Disorders:**  Therapy helps address distorted body image, unhealthy eating patterns, and underlying emotional issues.
    *   **Grief and Loss:**  Provides support and coping strategies.
    *   **Chronic Pain & Illness:**  Can help manage the emotional impact of chronic health conditions.
    *   **Adjustment Issues:**  Difficult life transitions (job loss, divorce, etc.).
* **Long-Term Benefits:** Studies show that the positive effects of counseling can last for years after treatment ends.




**2. How Counseling Works: Different Approaches**

There are many different types of counseling, each with its own theoretical approach. Here are a few common ones:

*   **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. It's very practical and goal-oriented. (Good for anxiety, depression, phobias, etc.)
*   **Psychodynamic Therapy:** Explores unconscious patterns and past experiences to gain insight into current behaviors. (Often longer-term, focuses on understanding the root causes of issues).
*   **Humanistic Therapy (e.g., Person-Centered Therapy):** Emphasizes self-awareness, acceptance, and personal growth.  The therapist provides a supportive and non-judgmental environment.
*   **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):**  A type of CBT that focuses on emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and mindfulness. (Often used for borderline personality disorder, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts).
*   **Family Systems Therapy:** Views problems within the context of the family system and aims to improve communication and dynamics.
*   **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):** Focuses on accepting difficult thoughts and feelings rather than fighting them, and committing to values-based actions.

**3. What Can Counseling Help With? (It's Broader Than You Think)**

It's not just for ""serious"" mental illness. People go to counseling for all sorts of reasons:

*   **Improving Self-Esteem:**  Building confidence and self-worth.
*   **Managing Stress:** Developing coping strategies for everyday pressures.
*   **Improving Communication Skills:**  Learning to express needs and boundaries effectively.
*   **Setting Boundaries:** Establishing healthy limits in relationships.
*   **Making Difficult Decisions:**  Exploring options and clarifying values.
*   **Personal Growth:**  Seeking self-discovery and fulfillment.
*   **Navigating Life Transitions:**  Dealing with changes like career shifts, moving, or relationship changes.
*   **Understanding Patterns:** Recognizing repetitive unhealthy patterns in relationships or behavior.




**4. Factors That Influence How Well Counseling Works:**

This is where it gets nuanced.  Counseling isn't one-size-fits-all.

*   **The Therapeutic Relationship:** *This is the most important factor.*  You need",0.47723081707954407,1.5536072931159572e-155,0.0847682119205298,0.2258204021253472
"I just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. My family and I really need this job.
   People keep telling me I have ""anxiety"" and I'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. This is all new to me. What can I do?","Hi, It is really good that you are working so hard to take care of your family. Anxiety can be so challenging, especially when new challenges have come up. It would be good to work through some of these issues you are experiencing, and examine your self care and support processes.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, but it's also incredibly common. Starting a new job *is* stressful, and adding long-distance travel and family separation on top of that is a LOT. It's understandable you're feeling this way, and it's smart of you to proactively look for ways to cope, especially given the concerns about anxiety. Let's break down some things you can do.  I'll cover a lot, so feel free to focus on what resonates with you.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am not a medical professional.**

**1. Understanding What's Happening (and It Might Not Be ""Just Anxiety"")**

*   **It's Normal to Feel This Way:** You're experiencing a massive life change.  Feelings of worry, fear, and being overwhelmed are *completely* normal.  Don't beat yourself up for feeling this way.  Labeling it ""anxiety"" can sometimes feel scary, but it's just a way of describing a set of physical and emotional responses to stress.
*   **What *is* an Anxiety Attack?** People use this term loosely. Generally, it's a sudden surge of intense fear or discomfort that peaks within minutes. Symptoms can include:
    *   Rapid heartbeat
    *   Sweating
    *   Trembling
    *   Shortness of breath
    *   Feeling of choking
    *   Chest pain
    *   Nausea
    *   Dizziness
    *   Feeling unreal or detached
    *   Fear of losing control or dying
    *   It's important to know that while *very* frightening, anxiety attacks are usually not dangerous.  They are a sign your nervous system is overwhelmed.
*   **Adjustment Disorder vs. Generalized Anxiety:** What you're experiencing might be *adjustment disorder* – difficulty adjusting to a stressful life event. It's different than a pre-existing anxiety disorder. Knowing this can help you frame it differently.
* **The Role of Grief**: Leaving family and your familiar life is a form of loss, and grief can manifest as anxiety-like symptoms. Recognizing this can help you be kinder to yourself.



**2. Proactive Strategies - Before You Go & While on the Road**

*   **Preparation is Key:** The more you prepare, the more control you'll feel, which can lessen anxiety.
    *   **Logistics:**  Detailed travel plans (flights, hotels, routes).  Have backups.  Know where the nearest hospital is to where you're staying.
    *   **Communication Plan:**  Schedule regular calls/video chats with your family.  Set expectations for how often you'll be in touch.  Knowing you have a scheduled connection can be a huge relief.
    *   **Work Preparation:**  Understand your role thoroughly.  What are the key expectations?  What resources are available?
*   **Build a ""Comfort Kit"":**  Pack things that bring you comfort and a sense of normalcy.
    *   Photos of family.
    *   A favorite book or music.
    *   A small, familiar item.
    *   Comfortable clothing.
    *   Anything that reminds you of home.
*   **Establish Routines:** Routines provide stability.
    *   **Morning Routine:** Stick to a similar wake-up time, even on the road.  Include things like exercise, a healthy breakfast, or meditation.
    *   **Evening Routine:**  Wind down with a relaxing activity (reading, journaling, listening to music) before bed.
*   **Healthy Habits:** These are crucial.
    *   **Sleep:**  Prioritize sleep!  It's the foundation of everything.
    *   **Nutrition:**  Eat healthy meals and snacks.  Avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol.
    *   **Exercise:**  Even a 20-30 minute walk each day can make a huge difference.  It releases endorphins that have mood-boosting effects.
*   **Mindfulness & Relaxation Techniques:**  Practice these *before* you need them.  They are skills that take practice.
    *   **Deep Breathing:**  Simple but powerful.  Try box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4).
    *   **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:**  Tense and release different muscle groups to relieve tension.
    *   **Meditation:**  There are many guided meditation apps (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer).
    *   **Grounding Techniques:** If you start to feel overwhelmed, use your senses to ground yourself in the present moment. (5-4-3-2-1 method: name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things",0.4812120497226715,1.7055557829626647e-155,0.06213017751479289,0.186960690316395
"I'm in my late teens and live with my dad.  The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I won't want to talk to them for days or even weeks. 

Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.

Are they right, am I depressed?","Hello. Being a teenager in our society today can cause depression quite easily. We look at the world in which we live, and the doubts we have about being able to make a contribution, or to have value and worth with the people around us, and we begin to internalize those messages of self-worth. If that alone were not enough, you are trying to figure out where you want to go in life, and who you are supposed to be in the world. Teens are faced with pressures of being judged by your peers for how you present yourself; following current fashions; possessing the trendy things; and hanging out with the ""in crowd."" Here's a ""secret"" that might help with most of those issues: Not much of those problems I've just described will really matter as they might seem to right now, in the real world. If you are feeling depression because you feel you lack some of those things that are seen as important by others (like your peers), I can assure you that being someone who is kind; compassionate; understanding of another person's suffering; and the effort you make to be the best person you can become in the world, will far outweigh anything you experienced in your teen years.When we are young, we judge everything based on what our peers have, what they say, the way they dress, who's popular, who's not popular, and for the most of it, all of that is external. So the question becomes, are you trying to fix the feelings on the inside (the internal stuff), with the trappings of all the stuff on the outside (the internal)? That is to say, do you feel that if you had what your friends have, you would be happy and less depressed? Depression is usually a symptom of something much bigger, it is not typically a problem by itself (just as a person who experiences a high temperature may likely have a cold). So fixing the symptom requires looking at the possible causes. In your post, you mentioned that you live with your dad. Are your parents divorced or separated, or has your mom passed away? Either of these circumstances could certainly cause depression. Finding out when you started feeling depressed, might be able to pinpoint the trigger that caused it, which requires looking at when you last felt really happy. It is also important to keep in mind, that as a teenager, your emotions are often being experienced very randomly, and sometimes without cause. It is part of your emotional development, but as you grow older can learn how to manage those emotions better and practice doing things that help you feel better (without causing harm to yourself).Have you tried talking to your dad about your feelings, or maybe another relative if you feel safer doing so? Do you have a friend who is your best friend...someone who is there for you no matter what? If not, there is a service you can use that is a national number for teens to talk with teen peer counselors. They are teens like yourself, but they have some insights that might be helpful. Its called Teen Line (https://teenlineonline.org/). It helped me when I was in my teens, and has helped lots of other teens as well. You might find a place to get some referrals to other local services in your area. If you want are in Washington state and would like to connect with me directly, you call link to me via my profile page. Or perhaps finding a counselor in your local area might be useful. Most towns and cities have some form of low cost counseling. You might also check with your school for assistance.Don't be afraid of not always knowing how you are supposed to feel. Adults don't always have a handle on it either. Being a teenager carries a lot stress, fear, and uncertainty. But you are not alone, and there is help if you reach out for it. I wish for you the very best, and bright future. ","Okay, this sounds like a really tough situation, and it's good you're reaching out and asking questions. It takes courage to do that. Let's break down what you've shared and talk about what might be going on, and how to get help.

**First, let's address the core of your concern: ""Are they right, am I depressed?""**

I am *not* a medical professional, so I cannot diagnose you. *Only* a qualified doctor or therapist can do that. However, what you're describing – the fluctuating desire to socialize, feelings of worthlessness, and believing you'll never do anything right – are *all* common symptoms of depression. 

Here's a little more detail on why those things connect to depression:

* **Social Withdrawal & Fluctuating Social Desire:** Depression doesn't always look like constant sadness. Sometimes it manifests as losing interest in things you once enjoyed, including spending time with friends. The push-pull you describe – wanting to connect *sometimes* but then wanting to isolate – is very common. It's not that you don't *like* your friends, it's that depression is draining your energy and motivation.
* **Feelings of Worthlessness:** This is a *classic* symptom of depression. It's that internal voice that tells you you're not good enough, that you're a burden, or that you're failing.  It's important to remember that those feelings are *part of the illness* and aren't necessarily based on reality.
* **Pessimism & Feeling Like You'll Never Do Anything Right:**  Depression can make it very hard to see a positive future. It can skew your perspective, making you focus on failures and dismiss successes.

**It's important to remember:**  Having these *symptoms* doesn't automatically mean you have depression.  Everyone feels down sometimes. But the *pattern*, the *intensity*, and the *duration* of these feelings are important.



**Let's look at the other parts of what you've said:**

* **Living with your Dad:**  While living at home isn't inherently bad, it can add stress, especially in your late teens.  Are you feeling stifled? Is there tension in the relationship?  These things can contribute to feeling down.
* **College Classes as the Only Outing:** This points to a limited social life. While focusing on education is important, a lack of regular social interaction can exacerbate feelings of isolation and loneliness.
* **The ""They"" You Mention:** You say ""Are *they* right...""  Who are ""they""? Are these friends who are saying negative things to you?  Or is this an internal voice that *sounds* like it's coming from others?  Identifying the source of these negative thoughts is crucial. If friends *are* being unsupportive, that's a problem that needs to be addressed.




**What should you do next?  Here's a plan:**

1. **Talk to a Trusted Adult:** This is the most important step.  This could be:
    * **Your Dad:**  Even if your relationship is complicated, try to have an honest conversation.  You don't have to say ""I think I'm depressed"" right away. You could start by saying, ""I've been feeling really down lately, and I'm struggling with my motivation and self-esteem.""
    * **A School Counselor:**  They are trained to help students with emotional issues and can provide support and resources.  This is often a very accessible first step.
    * **A Teacher or Professor:** If you have a teacher you trust, they might be able to offer guidance.
    * **Another Relative:** An aunt, uncle, grandparent, etc.
2. **See a Doctor:**  A medical doctor can rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms (like a thyroid issue or vitamin deficiency).  They can also refer you to a mental health professional.
3. **Consider Therapy:** A therapist can provide a safe space to explore your feelings, develop coping mechanisms, and address the root causes of your distress.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is often very effective for depression.
4. **Self-Care:** While professional help is essential, there are things you can do to support your well-being:
    * **Regular Sleep:** Aim for 8-10 hours of sleep per night.
    * **Healthy Diet:**  Eat nutritious foods.
    * **Exercise:**  Even a short walk can make a difference.
    * **Engage in Activities You Enjoy:**  Even if you don't *feel* like it, try to do something you used to enjoy, even for a short time.
    * **Mindfulness & Relaxation Techniques",0.569428026676178,0.0231455942184704,0.15755855216465578,0.28587943216495965
I’m facing severe depression and anxiety and I just feel like I’m going through a lot. This really distracts me and I cant get my mind off the things that are bothering me.    How do I overcome this anxierty and depression?,Anxiety and depression are often linked. I don't consider them as diseases. Depression is a symptom of deep hurts to the sense of self that leaves a person feeling shamed. Anxiety is a symptom of not being given the proper emotional resources to handle the problems of life. It is also the result of being taught that life is a dangerous place that can't be managed.,"Okay, it takes a *lot* of courage to admit you're struggling with depression and anxiety, and I want to acknowledge that first. It's really good that you're reaching out, even just by writing this. It sounds incredibly difficult to be constantly bombarded by distressing thoughts, and it's understandable that it's impacting your ability to function.  I'm here to offer some support and guidance, but please read the **important disclaimer at the end** as I am not a substitute for professional help.

Here's a breakdown of strategies to help you navigate this, broken down into sections.  It's a lot, so don't feel you need to do everything at once.  Start small.  I'll also categorize things based on immediacy – things you can try *right now* versus things that are more long-term.

**I. Immediate Relief (When you're in the thick of it)**

These are things to try when you're feeling overwhelmed *in the moment*.  They won't ""cure"" anything, but they can help you regain a little control.

*   **Grounding Techniques:**  These bring you back to the present moment.  Anxiety often involves getting caught up in future worries, and depression in the past.
    *   **5-4-3-2-1:**  Name 5 things you can *see*, 4 things you can *touch*, 3 things you can *hear*, 2 things you can *smell*, and 1 thing you can *taste*.
    *   **Deep Breathing:**  Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose, filling your belly, and exhale slowly through your mouth.  Try box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4).
    *   **Physical Sensations:**  Hold an ice cube, take a warm shower, or wrap yourself in a blanket.  Focus on the physical sensation.
*   **Distraction (Healthy Distraction):**  This isn't about avoiding feelings forever, but about giving your brain a temporary break.
    *   **Music:** Listen to uplifting or calming music.
    *   **Gentle Movement:**  A short walk, stretching, or dancing can release endorphins.
    *   **Engaging Activity:**  Read a book, watch a funny video, do a puzzle, or play a game.  (Avoid things that might trigger negative thoughts.)
    *   **Creative Expression:**  Journaling, drawing, painting, or writing can be outlets for your emotions.
*   **Self-Soothing:**
    *   **Comforting Items:**  Hold a favorite object, wear comfortable clothes.
    *   **Warm Drink:**  Herbal tea (chamomile, lavender) can be calming.
    *   **Positive Self-Talk (even if you don't believe it yet):**  ""This is hard, but I can get through this.""  ""I've felt bad before, and it has passed.""



**II.  Mid-Range Strategies (Daily/Weekly Habits)**

These require a bit more effort but build resilience over time.

*   **Regular Exercise:**  Even 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week can significantly improve mood and reduce anxiety.
*   **Healthy Diet:**  Focus on whole foods, fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and healthy fats.  Limit processed foods, sugar, and caffeine. (This isn't about dieting, it's about fueling your brain.)
*   **Consistent Sleep Schedule:**  Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night.  Create a relaxing bedtime routine.
*   **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  Even 5-10 minutes a day can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without getting carried away by them.  There are many apps (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer) that can guide you.
*   **Social Connection:**  Spend time with people who support and uplift you.  Talk to trusted friends or family members.  Even a short phone call can make a difference.
*   **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and identify patterns.
*   **Limit Exposure to Triggers:** If certain news sources, social media accounts, or people consistently make you feel worse, limit your exposure to them.
*   **Nature:**  Spending time outdoors has been shown to reduce stress and improve mood.



**III. Long-Term Solutions (Professional Help & Deeper Work)**

These are crucial for addressing the root causes of your depression and anxiety.

*   **Therapy:**  This is arguably the *most* important step.  A therapist can provide a safe space to explore your feelings, develop coping mechanisms, and address underlying issues.",0.4529651701450348,1.720992030633196e-155,0.060689655172413794,0.1812191103789127
"My husband and I have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. Others have told me that most men would have left me by now. Honestly, I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing. I want to be better connected with my husband.","It's encouraging that you say you want ""to be better connected with [your] husband,"" and since he hasn't left you, he must care about you and the relationship more than he does about just having sex. You don't say whether he complains or not, but even if he doesn't it seems there's a sense of something important missing for both of you.Most likely to connect better with him physically you'll need to become better connected with yourself and your body. Men often feel fulfilled by sex simply because it happened - the woman they want received them, allowed them to make love with her. For women that can sometimes be more complicated. A woman who loves sex most likely also loves her body, knows what pleasures her, and feels confident asking for what she wants. Self-pleasuring can be a way for you to discover more about your sexuality, and a classic resource is Betty Dodson's book Sex for One: The Joy of Selfloving. A good counselor or sex therapist can be very helpful with your whole relationship as well as the sexual part of it, but not all counselors are comfortable working with sexual issues. Shop around and be sure you find someone who can help you and your husband get better connected on all levels.","Okay, this is a really brave thing to acknowledge and address. It's incredibly common for sex to ebb and flow in long-term relationships, and a significantly low frequency like you describe *is* something to work on, but it absolutely doesn't mean your marriage is doomed. The fact that you *want* to be more connected with your husband is a huge and positive first step.  And honestly, the comments from others?  Ignore them. Every relationship is different, and their ""most men"" doesn't define your reality or your husband.

Here's a breakdown of things to consider, categorized for clarity.  This is a lot, so feel free to take it in pieces.  I'll try to be thorough.  I'll also add a disclaimer at the end.

**1. Understanding the Problem - Digging Deeper**

*   **Your Sex Drive (Libido):** You suspect yours is low, which is a good starting point for self-reflection.
    *   **Physical Factors:** Are there any medical reasons?  This includes things like hormonal imbalances (thyroid, menopause approaching, PCOS, etc.), medication side effects (antidepressants are common culprits), chronic illness, pain, or fatigue. A visit to your doctor for a check-up is a good first step to rule these out.
    *   **Psychological Factors:** Stress, anxiety, depression, body image issues, past trauma, and even just being overwhelmed with life can *significantly* impact libido.
    *   **Relationship Factors:**  This is huge.  Are you feeling emotionally connected to your husband?  Resentment, anger, lack of trust, or feeling unappreciated can all kill desire.  Feeling safe and comfortable are essential.
    *   **Lifestyle Factors:**  Sleep deprivation, poor diet, lack of exercise, and excessive alcohol consumption can all contribute to low libido.
*   **His Perspective:** You say neither of you knows what you're doing, which implies he might also be feeling unsure or unfulfilled.  You *need* to have an open conversation with him about this.  Don't accuse, just share your feelings and ask about his.
    *   **Is he satisfied?** How does *he* feel about the situation?
    *   **Is he initiating?** If so, is he feeling rejected? If not, why?
    *   **Does he have any underlying issues?**  Similar to you, could there be physical, psychological, or relationship factors affecting him? (Erectile dysfunction, performance anxiety, stress, etc.)
*   **The ""Not Knowing What You're Doing"" Part:** This is *very* common. Sex isn’t always intuitive.
    *   **Lack of Education:** Many people receive limited or inaccurate sex education.
    *   **Communication Breakdown:**  Not talking openly about desires, fantasies, and what feels good is a huge barrier.
    *   **Routine & Predictability:**  Sex can become stale if it's always the same.



**2. Communication is Key – How to Talk to Your Husband**

This is the hardest part, but the most important.

*   **Choose the Right Time & Place:**  Not right before bed, not during an argument, and not when you're both stressed.  A calm, private setting is best.
*   **""I"" Statements:**  Focus on your feelings, not accusations.  Instead of ""You never initiate,"" try ""I feel disconnected when we don't have physical intimacy.""
*   **Be Vulnerable:** Share your insecurities and desires.  Tell him you want to improve your connection and explore this with him.
*   **Active Listening:**  Really *listen* to what he has to say, without interrupting or getting defensive.  Ask clarifying questions.
*   **Validate His Feelings:** Even if you don't agree with him, acknowledge his perspective.  ""I understand why you might feel that way.""
*   **Focus on Connection, Not Just Sex:** Talk about what makes you both feel loved, appreciated, and close.
*    **Start Small:** Don’t try to solve everything in one conversation.



**3.  Rebuilding Intimacy – Beyond the Bedroom**

Intimacy is more than just sex.  Focusing on these areas can create a foundation for a more fulfilling physical relationship.

*   **Quality Time:**  Regularly schedule dedicated time together, free from distractions (phones, TV, kids, etc.).  Date nights, walks, hobbies you both enjoy.
*   **Physical Touch (Non-Sexual):**  Hold hands, hug, cuddle on the couch, give each other back rubs.  These small gestures build connection and release oxytocin (the ""bonding hormone"").
*   **Acts of Service:**  Do something thoughtful for each other.",0.5219513177871704,0.017128563110142544,0.13137032842582105,0.3084402322108726
"I'm a teenager and I get these really intense mood swings.    My mood will be really high and I'll think of something that I want to do. When I start to make it happen I get irritated by other people if they intervene. Then if the thing I wanted to do doesn't work out, I have these tendencies to blame other people for it not working out.    Can you explain what's going on?","Mood swings and getting frustrated when things don't work out is totally normal. Sometimes, we get tied to one thing we really want to do and it can feel pretty intense when that gets interrupted or doesn't work out. This said, you're coming to CounselChat and so I'm guessing this is something that is pretty intense for you and something that you are concerned about. If this is getting in the way of your life, it may be worthwhile to reach out to a therapist or doctor to get some help with this and see if there might be something more going on. While for most people frustration/mood swings is related to typical life and stress, if very intense it can be a sign of a number of challenges ranging from anxiety to a traumatic experience to something like Bipolar Disorder where a person's mood and energy might fly so high (mania) that one feels like they can do anything but often become frustrated when interrupted (note: there is a lot more to Bipolar Disorder than this and this is certainly not a diagnosis). Wish you well!","Okay, it's really good you're recognizing this pattern and asking about it. That takes self-awareness, and that's a fantastic first step. What you're describing definitely sounds like a challenging cycle, and it's not uncommon for teenagers to experience these kinds of intense emotional shifts. Here's a breakdown of what might be going on, covering the different parts of the cycle you described, and what areas could be contributing.  I'll break it down into sections to make it easier to follow.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am not a substitute for professional advice.**

**1. The ""High"" and Intense Motivation:**

* **Teenage Brain Development:** Your brain is *still developing* – specifically the prefrontal cortex, which handles things like planning, impulse control, and emotional regulation. This means you're naturally going to experience more intense emotions, and those emotions can sometimes feel overwhelming. The ""high"" you experience is likely tied to dopamine release – a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward. When you have an idea you're excited about, your brain floods with dopamine, making you feel great and focused.
* **Novelty Seeking:**  Teenagers often crave novelty and excitement.  Trying new things, pursuing passions, and having goals are all healthy, but the intensity of that drive can be higher during this period of life.
* **Identity Formation:** You're figuring out who you are and what you like. This process involves experimenting, having ideas, and wanting to express yourself. These ambitions can feel really important.



**2. Irritability with Intervention:**

* **Executive Functioning Challenges:**  Again, the developing prefrontal cortex plays a role here.  When you're really focused on something and experiencing that dopamine rush, any interruption can feel incredibly frustrating. It’s hard to switch gears or consider another perspective when you’re “in the zone.”  It’s like your brain gets stuck on a track.
* **Sense of Ownership:** You've generated this idea, and you're starting to put energy into it.  Intervention can feel like someone is trying to take *your* thing away, or questioning your ability to handle it.
* **Difficulty with Frustration Tolerance:**  Because emotional regulation is still developing, it can be harder to cope with frustration. A little bit of feedback or a suggestion can feel like a major setback.
* **Perceived Criticism:** Even if someone is offering helpful advice, it can sometimes be *perceived* as criticism, especially when you're feeling vulnerable or particularly invested in an outcome.



**3. Blaming Others When Things Don't Go as Planned:**

* **Difficulty Taking Responsibility:**  This is really common, and honestly, humans do this at all ages!  It’s often easier to look outward and find someone to blame than to face the possibility that things didn’t work out because of your own actions, or because of factors outside of anyone's control. It can feel less painful.
* **Emotional Regulation (Again):** When the dopamine rush fades and you're faced with disappointment, it can be hard to process those negative emotions in a healthy way. Blaming others can be a way to avoid feeling the full weight of that disappointment.
* **Cognitive Distortions:** These are unhelpful thought patterns.  A common one is ""externalizing"" – attributing negative events to external factors (other people) rather than internal ones (your own choices or limitations).  Another might be ""all-or-nothing thinking"" – if it’s not a complete success, it's a total failure, and someone *must* be at fault.
* **Low Frustration Tolerance (Revisited):**  If you have a hard time coping with frustration in general, setbacks can feel catastrophic, making you more likely to look for someone to blame.

**Possible Contributing Factors (Beyond Typical Teen Development):**

* **Stress:** High levels of stress (school, social life, family issues) can exacerbate mood swings and make it harder to regulate emotions.
* **Sleep:**  Teenagers need a *lot* of sleep, and many don't get enough. Sleep deprivation significantly impacts mood and emotional control.
* **Diet:**  An unhealthy diet can also contribute to mood swings.
* **Underlying Mental Health Conditions:** While it doesn’t automatically mean this is happening, these patterns *can* sometimes be associated with conditions like:
    * **Depression:**  Can manifest as irritability, especially in teens.
    * **Anxiety:**  Can lead to heightened emotional reactivity.
    * **Bipolar Disorder:**  (Less common, but important to rule out if the ""highs"" are *extremely* elevated and accompanied by other symptoms like decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, and impulsive behavior).
    * **Intermittent Explosive Disorder:** Character",0.5252900719642639,7.292271967957544e-79,0.11509229098805646,0.3318334905545477
"I'm going through some things with my feelings and myself. I barely sleep and I do nothing but think about how I'm worthless and how I shouldn't be here.
   I've never tried or contemplated suicide. I've always wanted to fix my issues, but I never get around to it.
   How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?","You can, for sure... and the first step is to believe you are worthy TO YOURSELF. Recognizing you are in a quest is already a big first step. Taking the time to start figuring out who you are is definitely the next... do so with SELF COMPASSION and kindness. Know this is a process and just look forward for what you might find.  I do recommend you find someone to talk to (there are many options out there that can fit the situation you are in), and I also recommend you start by giving yourself the importance to invest some time and effort in this quest. YOU DESERVE IT. There are some excellent TED Talks you can google, great books you can read, or even joining a yoga practice, team or some kind of hobby may help. Anything that shows yourself you are worthy of this effort. Have patience and start!!!! the answer is out there waiting for you. Asking these questions already set you on the right path.","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult, and it takes a lot of courage to even *say* these things, so I want to acknowledge that right away.  You're carrying a heavy burden, and the fact that you're reaching out, even in this way, shows a spark of wanting things to be different.  That's important.  It's good you haven't acted on thoughts of ending your life, and it's good you *want* to fix things.  Let's try to unpack this a little, and I'll offer some suggestions, but please read the **important disclaimer at the end** because this isn't a substitute for professional help.

**Understanding What You're Describing**

What you're describing – persistent negative self-talk, feeling worthless, trouble sleeping due to rumination – are all hallmarks of depression and/or low self-esteem.  It's a cycle: negative thoughts lead to negative feelings, which reinforce negative thoughts.  It's exhausting, and it's *treatable*.  The fact that you haven't acted on suicidal thoughts doesn't mean the pain isn't real or significant.  It means there's still a part of you that's holding on, that wants to get better.

**Breaking Down the ""Worthlessness""**

The feeling of worthlessness is often rooted in a few key areas.  Let's look at those and how you might start to challenge them:

* **Internalized Criticism:**  Where did this feeling of worthlessness come from?  Was it something you were told growing up?  Do you hold yourself to impossibly high standards?  Identifying the *source* can help you understand it's not necessarily *true*, just a learned pattern of thinking.
* **Negative Self-Talk:**  You say you ""think about how I'm worthless."" What specifically do you tell yourself?  Write down those thoughts.  Really get them out of your head and onto paper (or a screen).  Once you see them written down, you can start to question them.
* **Focus on Perceived Flaws:**  We all have things we don't like about ourselves.  But when we fixate on those things, and believe they define our value, that's a problem.  
* **Lack of Self-Compassion:**  Would you talk to a friend the way you talk to yourself?  Probably not.  We're often much harder on ourselves than we are on others.



**Small Steps Towards Change**

You said you want to fix things but ""never get around to it.""  That's very common when you're feeling overwhelmed.  Here's how to make ""fixing things"" less daunting:

1. **Start Tiny:** Don't try to overhaul your life overnight.  That's a recipe for failure and more negative self-talk. Pick *one* incredibly small thing.  Examples:
    * **Make your bed.** Seriously. It's an accomplishment.
    * **Drink a glass of water first thing in the morning.**
    * **Take a 5-minute walk.**
    * **Write down one thing you're grateful for.** (Even if it's just ""I have a warm bed."")
    * **Brush your teeth.** (Sounds silly, but basic self-care is crucial)

2. **Challenge Negative Thoughts (Thought Records):**  This is a technique from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). When you catch yourself thinking ""I'm worthless,"" write it down. Then, ask yourself:
    * **What evidence supports this thought?**  (Be honest, but be critical.)
    * **What evidence contradicts this thought?**  (This is the harder part.  Try to find *something* positive, even small.)
    * **What's a more balanced thought?** (Instead of ""I'm worthless,"" maybe ""I'm struggling right now, and that's okay. I'm trying."")

3. **Practice Self-Compassion:**  Talk to yourself like you would talk to a friend who was going through the same thing.  Use kind and understanding language.  There are guided self-compassion meditations available online (see resources below).

4. **Re-engage with Things You Used to Enjoy:**  Even if you don't *feel* like doing them, try to do something you once found pleasurable.  It could be listening to music, reading, drawing, cooking, anything.  It's about reconnecting with positive experiences.

5. **Limit Rumination:**  This is hard, especially when you're not sleeping.  Try these techniques:
    * **Scheduled Worry Time:**  Give yourself 15-20 minutes each day to *specifically* worry and ruminate.  Outside",0.49980825185775757,3.1044506122802615e-155,0.10772833723653397,0.2825782344698739
"I think I'm annoying and bothersome, but my girlfriend says I'm just fine. I don't think so, I think I'm stressing everyone else out","I'm glad to hear you have friends and that your friends say they like you.Trust your own sense of who you are which tells you that something feels uneasy within yourself.Is the friend who says you're ""just fine"", very familiar with who you are?""Friend"" is a broad category.She may not know you as fully as you know yourself.Basically, it is possible to be ""fine"" and have some inner stress.Follow your own thoughts and observations to more fully learn about yourself in ways your friend may not notice or be aware.","Okay, this is a really common and tough feeling. It's good you're recognizing this and wanting to understand it better. It's *especially* good that your girlfriend says you're fine, but it's also understandable why you're still struggling if you feel differently. Here's a breakdown of what might be going on, and how to approach it, broken down into sections.  It's long, but I want to be thorough.

**1. Why You Might Feel This Way (Understanding the Root)**

* **Anxiety and Self-Perception:**  Often, feeling like a burden stems from anxiety.  Anxiety can distort your perception of how others see you. You might be hyper-focused on potential negative reactions and interpreting neutral things as signs of annoyance.  You're essentially predicting a negative outcome and feeling it *as if* it's happening.
* **Past Experiences:** Have you had experiences in the past where you *were* made to feel like a burden?  Maybe critical family members, difficult friendships, or past relationships? These experiences can leave lasting emotional scars and influence how you see yourself now.  You might be projecting past patterns onto current relationships.
* **Perfectionism & High Standards:** Do you hold yourself to very high standards? If so, you might be overly critical of your own behavior and worry about not being ""good enough"" for the people in your life.  This can translate to feeling like you're constantly falling short and therefore being a burden.
* **Need for Reassurance:**  It's okay to need reassurance, but *relying* heavily on it can sometimes create a cycle.  You seek reassurance, get it, but the underlying feeling doesn't go away, leading you to seek more.
* **Misinterpreting Boundaries:** Sometimes, people set boundaries (saying ""no,"" needing space) and we interpret that as rejection or annoyance, even if it's just them taking care of their own needs.
* **Overthinking Social Interactions:** Do you replay conversations in your head and analyze them for hidden meanings?  This can lead to you finding things to criticize about your own behavior that others don't even notice.
* **Underlying Mental Health:** Feelings of worthlessness or being a burden are sometimes symptoms of depression or other mental health conditions.



**2. Why Your Girlfriend Might See Things Differently**

* **Love and Affection:** She loves you! This is huge. People in loving relationships tend to be more forgiving and understanding of imperfections. She likely focuses on your positive qualities and doesn’t dwell on the things you perceive as annoying.
* **Different Perspective:** She's an outside observer. She sees you in the context of your entire relationship and knows your good qualities. You're experiencing things from the inside, which can be much more self-critical.
* **She's Being Supportive:**  She might genuinely believe you're fine and is trying to build you up.  It's a loving thing to do, but it's also possible she's not fully aware of the *intensity* of your feelings.
* **She Has Different Tolerance Levels:** What *you* consider annoying, she might not even notice or might find endearing.  Everyone has different sensitivities.

**3. What You Can DO About It: A Multi-Pronged Approach**

* **Self-Reflection & Journaling:**
    * **Specifically, what behaviors make you feel like you're annoying?**  Write them down.  Be as specific as possible. (e.g., ""I talk too much about my problems,"" ""I ask for a lot of help,"" ""I interrupt people,"" ""I over-apologize"").
    * **What's the *worst* thing that would happen if you did those things?**  Really explore your fears.  Often, the worst-case scenario isn't as bad as we imagine.
    * **What evidence supports your belief that you're annoying?**  And *what evidence contradicts it*? (This is crucial.  Actively look for evidence that you're *not* annoying.)
    * **Track your feelings:** When do these feelings of being a burden come up? What triggers them?  What’s happening right before?

* **Talk to Your Girlfriend (Carefully):**
    * **Avoid accusatory language:** Don't say, ""You don't understand how annoying I am!""
    * **Instead, be vulnerable:**  ""I've been struggling with these feelings lately, and I wanted to share them with you. I sometimes worry that I'm being too much, or that I'm stressing you out.  I know you've said I'm fine, and I appreciate that, but it's something I'm working through.""
    * **Ask for specific",0.5369623899459839,2.6462774075971034e-155,0.08353808353808354,0.22004062288422477
"I was never single, afraid to be alone, and I looked for my boyfriend to make me happy. I finally worked on my self, was in a relationship, and I did everything a healthy girlfriend does and it didn't work out. Now months later, no man peaks my interest. Am I ready to date again? Is there a reason no one sparks my interest?","Yes, of course there's a reason!There's always a reason for most dynamics!Depending on the nature and qualities of what changed as a result of your new self realizations, you may be more deeply affected by your new awareness than how you imagined these would go.Since you already are on the best road possible for yourself, since this resulted from your own introspection, keep trusting your own self work as to what develops and at what pace your relationship attraction qualities grow.","Okay, this is a really insightful place to be, even if it *feels* confusing right now. It sounds like you've done a lot of really important work on yourself, and that's fantastic. Let's break down what's happening and explore both whether you're ready to date and why you might not be feeling that spark.

**First, let's acknowledge what you've already accomplished.** You recognized a pattern of needing a partner for happiness, and you actively worked to break that. You then *demonstrated* healthy relationship behaviors. That's huge. Many people talk about wanting to be better partners, but you actually *did* the work. Even though it didn't end with the outcome you hoped for, that doesn't invalidate your growth. In fact, it *proves* you're capable of healthy relating.

**Are you ready to date again?**

Honestly? Maybe not yet, and that's *okay*. There's no rulebook that says you need to jump back into dating after a certain period. Here's a way to think about it:

* **The ""Spark"" as a Signal:**  The lack of spark isn't necessarily a bad thing. It could be a very healthy signal that you're not feeling the *need* to fill a void.  When we're desperate to not be alone, our standards often lower, and we're more likely to force a connection.
* **Processing Grief & Re-Calibration:** Even if you were the one who initiated the breakup, or it was mutual, there's still a grieving process. You're grieving the future you envisioned, the companionship, and even the effort you put in. You also need time to re-calibrate your understanding of what you want and need *now*.
* **Self-Discovery Time:** You spent time working on yourself *within* a relationship context. Now you have an opportunity to explore what your life looks like, feels like, and what *you* want to create *independent* of a partner.  This is valuable.
* **No Pressure:** You don’t *have* to be dating.  You can focus on friends, family, hobbies, career, personal growth – whatever brings *you* joy.



**Why might no one be sparking your interest? Here are several possibilities:**

* **You're Still Healing:**  Your emotional energy might still be focused on processing the previous relationship.  It's hard to open yourself up to a new connection when you're still tending to old wounds.  Think of it like trying to taste a new dish when your mouth is still recovering from something spicy.
* **Your Standards Have (Healthily) Shifted:**  Because you've done the work to become more self-sufficient and self-aware, your criteria for a partner might have changed. You're no longer willing to settle for someone who doesn't meet your *genuine* needs, not just your need to not be alone. This is a *good* thing, but it can mean fewer people ""make the cut.""
* **You've Realized What You *Don't* Want:** Sometimes, a relationship ending clarifies what you absolutely don't want in a partner. That can make it harder to see potential in new people because you're acutely aware of potential red flags.
* **You're Enjoying Your Independence:**  This is a big one. You've discovered the joys and benefits of being self-reliant and creating a life you love on your own.  The appeal of disrupting that might be low.
* **You're Unconsciously Protecting Yourself:**  You might be subconsciously putting up walls to avoid getting hurt again.  This can manifest as disinterest in potential partners.
* **The Right Person Hasn't Come Along:** This is the simple truth. Sometimes it just takes time. It's possible that you haven't met someone who genuinely aligns with your values, interests, and what you're looking for.
* **You're Idealizing:** You may be holding out for someone who ticks *every* box, which is unrealistic.  No one is perfect, and sometimes we need to be open to people who might not fit our ""ideal"" but are still wonderful partners.

**What can you do?**

* **Continue Focusing on Yourself:**  Keep doing the things that make you happy. Invest in your hobbies, friendships, and personal growth.
* **Self-Reflection:** Journaling can be incredibly helpful.  Ask yourself:
    * What are my core values?
    * What do I truly need in a partner? (Not just want, but *need* for a healthy, fulfilling relationship)
    * What are my non-negotiables?
    * What am I afraid of in a new relationship?
* **Be Open to Casual Connections",0.4925627112388611,2.0721161176537274e-155,0.07990314769975787,0.20093432385311422
"When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. She is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but I am afraid she is stressing too much. I’m afraid it’s going to break her. I don't know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal.","It may be helpful to register for a class you can take together. I would recommend mindful meditation or yoga, just the two of you. Something you find time for in a weekly basis. Yoga is amazing in learning mindfulness and reducing stress. I use yoga and mindful techniques when working with children and recommend it to parents to engage with their children. Hope this helps.","Okay, this is a really common concern, and you're right to be attentive to it. It's great that you recognize this is a pattern and that you're worried about her well-being. A bright, high-achieving kid cracking under pressure is *very* common, and it sounds like you're picking up on a potential problem before it becomes a bigger one. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering whether to seek professional help, what you can do at home, and how to frame your approach.  I'll cover a lot, so feel free to skip to sections that resonate most.

**1. Is This ""Not Normal""?**

Let's normalize this a bit.  While a complete meltdown over seemingly small things *isn't ideal*, it's absolutely understandable in a high-achieving child. Here's why:

*   **Pressure Cooker:** Students who consistently strive for perfection often put immense pressure on themselves.  They may feel like *everything* is high-stakes.  A minor setback feels catastrophic.
*   **All-or-Nothing Thinking:** High achievers can sometimes fall into ""all-or-nothing"" thinking.  Anything less than perfect is seen as failure.
*   **Underlying Anxiety:**  The 4.0 isn't just about intelligence; it's likely tied to a level of anxiety around performance.
*   **Emotional Regulation Skills:** Sometimes, very bright kids haven't had to *learn* coping mechanisms for stress because things have come relatively easily to them. They haven't built up the ""emotional muscle"" to handle setbacks.
*   **Developmental Stage:** Adolescence is a time of huge hormonal and emotional changes anyway. Layering academic stress on top of that can be a recipe for overwhelm.



**2. Should You Seek Professional Help? (And What Kind?)**

Yes, *consider* it.  I'm not saying immediately rush to a doctor, but it's worth exploring. Here's a tiered approach:

*   **Start with a Conversation with the School Counselor:**  This is a great first step. The counselor can:
    *   Offer insight into how she's presenting at school.
    *   Help you understand if this is a new behavior or has been ongoing.
    *   Suggest school-based resources.
    *   Sometimes, just knowing the school is aware can be helpful.
*   **Pediatrician:** A visit to her pediatrician is a good idea.  They can rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to her emotional reactivity (though this is less likely, it's good to check). They can also provide referrals to mental health professionals.
*   **Therapist/Counselor (Specifically one experienced with high-achieving students):** This is likely the most helpful route *if* the problem is significant or doesn't improve with other interventions.  Look for someone specializing in:
    *   **Anxiety:**  Very common in this scenario.
    *   **Perfectionism:**  They can help her challenge those thought patterns.
    *   **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  A very effective therapy for anxiety and stress, teaching coping skills.
    *   **Mindfulness-Based Therapy:**  Can help her learn to be present and manage overwhelming feelings.
    *   **Stress Management Techniques:** Learning practical tools.

**Don't wait if you see any of these:**

*   **Changes in sleep or appetite:** Significant disruption.
*   **Withdrawal from friends or activities she usually enjoys.**
*   **Physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches that seem stress-related.**
*   **Expressions of hopelessness or feeling overwhelmed to the point of being unable to function.**
*   **Self-harm thoughts or behaviors (seek immediate help if this is the case – 988 is the suicide and crisis lifeline).**



**3. What You Can Do At Home – Immediate Support During a Meltdown**

*   **Stay Calm:**  Your calmness is contagious.  If *you* get stressed, it will escalate the situation.
*   **Validate Her Feelings:**  Don't dismiss her feelings, even if they seem small to you.  Say things like: ""That sounds really upsetting,"" or ""It makes sense you're feeling so frustrated.""  *Avoid* saying ""Don't worry about it"" or ""It's not a big deal.""
*   **Empathize:** ""It's really hard when you put so much effort into something and it doesn't go as planned.""
*   **Offer Comfort:** A hug, a quiet space, or just sitting with her can be helpful.
*   **Help Her Label the Feeling:** ""It sounds like you're feeling anxious about…"" or",0.4583362936973572,1.8714163356541617e-155,0.06775067750677506,0.18870490300337792
"I'm fine when we start becoming intimate, but out of nowhere, I will get a flashback of what happened to me in the past. I start hysterically crying and freaking out when my boyfriend obviously has done nothing to hurt me.","Have you sought the support of a therapist really qualified in working through sexual trauma? It can take some work, but healing is possible. If you feel able to, it may also help to open a dialogue with your boyfriend about what you need from him when you have these flashbacks. Let him know what some helpful responses may be. ","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult and understandably distressing for both you and your boyfriend. It's really good that you're recognizing this pattern and trying to understand it.  Here's a breakdown of what's likely happening, why, and what you can do, broken down into sections.  I'm going to cover a lot, so please read through it all.  **Please also see the Disclaimer at the very end, as this is not a substitute for professional help.**

**1. Understanding What's Happening: It's Likely Trauma-Related**

What you're describing strongly suggests you're experiencing **trauma responses**, specifically **flashbacks** and potentially **emotional flooding**. Here's a more detailed look:

* **Flashbacks:** These aren't just *memories* of a past event. They are *re-experiencing* the event as if it's happening *right now*.  Your brain essentially gets ""stuck"" in the past, and your body reacts as if you're currently in danger. This is why the crying and panic are so intense.  The triggers don’t need to logically connect to the trauma; they can be sensory (a smell, a touch, a position) or emotional.
* **Emotional Flooding:**  This happens when you're overwhelmed by intense emotions, to the point where you feel unable to cope.  The flashback triggers this flooding.  It's like a dam bursting.
* **Dissociation:** You might also be experiencing some level of dissociation, where you feel disconnected from your body, your emotions, or reality itself. This is a common protective mechanism during trauma.
* **It's *Not* About Your Boyfriend:** This is *crucially* important.  You recognize this intellectually, but emotionally, your brain is reacting to the *past* trauma, not the *present* situation.  Your boyfriend is simply present when the flashback is triggered, and it's a terrible feeling for both of you, but it's not his fault.  The reaction is rooted in something that happened *to* you, not *because* of him.
* **The ""Out of Nowhere"" Feeling:**  Flashbacks often *feel* like they come out of nowhere, but there's almost always a trigger, even if it's subtle and unconscious.  This trigger could be a physical sensation (a touch that reminds you of something), a scent, a word, a tone of voice, or even a feeling (like vulnerability or closeness).  Sometimes the trigger is internal – a thought or a feeling.



**2. Why This is Happening - Common Trauma Sources & Impact**

While I can't know the specifics of your past, here are some common situations that can lead to this type of response:

* **Sexual Assault/Abuse:** This is a very common cause of flashbacks during intimacy.
* **Physical Abuse:**  Experiences of physical harm can create strong associations between physical touch and fear.
* **Emotional Abuse:**  Even without physical contact, emotional abuse can leave deep scars and trigger flashbacks related to feelings of powerlessness, fear, or shame.
* **Childhood Trauma:**  Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) – such as neglect, witnessing violence, or experiencing household dysfunction – can have long-lasting effects on emotional regulation and trauma responses.
* **Other Traumatic Events:**  Serious accidents, natural disasters, witnessing violence, or other intensely frightening experiences can also lead to trauma.

**The impact of trauma changes the brain.** It can affect the amygdala (the fear center), the hippocampus (memory), and the prefrontal cortex (emotional regulation).  This explains why trauma responses can feel so automatic and overwhelming.

**3. What You Can Do - Strategies for Coping and Healing**

This is where it gets more proactive.  It's a process, and it will take time and effort.

* **Seek Professional Help (This is the *most* important step):**
    * **Trauma-Informed Therapist:**  Find a therapist specifically trained in trauma therapy.  Look for approaches like:
        * **EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing):**  Highly effective for processing traumatic memories.
        * **Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT):** Helps identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors related to the trauma.
        * **Sensorimotor Psychotherapy:** Focuses on the body's response to trauma.
        * **Somatic Experiencing:** Another body-centered approach to healing trauma.
    * **Don’t be afraid to “shop around” for a therapist you feel comfortable with.** The therapeutic relationship is vital.

* **Communicate with Your Boyfriend (When You're Calm):**
    * **Explain what's happening:**  Help him understand that your reactions are not about him,",0.46120747923851013,2.3198027921092187e-155,0.06657789613848202,0.21446593776282596
"I've hit my head on walls and floors ever since I was young. I sometimes still do it but I don't exactly know why,    I have anxiety and I had a rough childhood but now I'll start to hit my head and sometimes not realize it but I don't know how to stop or even why I'm doing it.    How can I help myself to change my behavior?","The best way to handle anxiety of this level is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor, and therapy to help you understand the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are causing the anxiety. This is not something that anyone should just “white knuckle” and try to get through on their own with no help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety. This takes a therapist trained in CBT. You will learn to recognize when and why you perform the behavior of hitting your head, help you deal with the underlying cause of this, and replace the behavior with a more positive behavior. You'll learn coping skills.You mention having a rough childhood. Anyone who has experienced trauma like this, especially long-term ongoing trauma from abuse of any kind, definitely does not need ""exposure therapy"", which is what is recommended for phobias. You need a therapist trained specifically in trauma informed therapy.You are on the right path by recognizing there is an issue and what it is. Good luck with your healing journey!","Okay, this sounds really difficult and it's good you're reaching out and wanting to understand and change this behavior.  Hitting your head, especially with a history going back to childhood, and coupled with anxiety and a rough upbringing, is a complex issue. It's *really* important to approach this with self-compassion and a focus on getting the right kind of support. Here's a breakdown of potential reasons, and a lot of ideas for how to help yourself, broken down into steps.  I'll also emphasize the need for professional help at the end.

**First: Understanding What Might Be Happening**

It's great you're recognizing this happens, even if you don't always realize it *in the moment*. Here are some possibilities contributing to this behavior:

* **Self-Soothing/Regulation:**  This is a very common reason.  When overwhelmed with anxiety, stress, or difficult emotions (possibly stemming from childhood trauma), people sometimes develop coping mechanisms that aren't healthy.  Hitting your head could be a way to:
    * **Ground Yourself:** The physical pain can bring you back to the present moment, momentarily disrupting overwhelming thoughts or feelings.  It's a very intense, and ultimately damaging, way to ground.
    * **Release Emotional Pressure:**  The pain might offer a physical outlet for emotional pain. It’s a way to *feel* something, even if it's negative, when you feel numb or disconnected.
    * **Punishment/Self-Harm:**  Sometimes, these behaviors can stem from feelings of self-worthlessness or guilt. It might be a subconscious form of self-punishment.  It's important to note this doesn't mean you *want* to hurt yourself, but that this behavior might be linked to negative self-perception.
* **Dissociation:**  You mention sometimes not realizing you're doing it. This could indicate dissociation, a feeling of detachment from your body or reality.  Dissociation is often a response to trauma, and it can lead to behaviors you're not fully aware of.
* **Habit/Learned Behavior:** Because this started in childhood, it might have become a deeply ingrained habit, a pattern your nervous system defaults to when stressed.
* **Sensory Seeking/Sensory Overload:**  Less common, but sometimes people engage in these behaviors because they have sensory processing differences and are either seeking or trying to manage intense sensory input.  (This is less likely if it's specifically triggered by emotional distress, but worth considering).
* **Underlying Neurological Factors:** Though less likely, it’s important to rule out any underlying neurological factors with a doctor. (See ""Important: Medical Checkup"" below).



**Second:  Steps You Can Take – Building a Toolkit**

These are things you can *start* doing now.  They're not a quick fix, but they can build a foundation for change.

1. **Increased Awareness – The First Line of Defense:**
   * **Journaling:**  Keep a journal specifically focused on *when* these incidents happen.  Note:
      * **Triggers:** What was happening *before* you hit your head?  (Thoughts, feelings, situations, people).  Be as specific as possible.
      * **Physical Sensations:** What did you feel in your body *before*, *during*, and *after*? (e.g., tightness in chest, racing heart, numbness, relief).
      * **Emotional State:** What emotions were present? (anxiety, sadness, anger, frustration, emptiness).
      * **Context:** Where were you? Who was around?
   * **Mindfulness:**  Practice mindfulness exercises (even just 5-10 minutes a day) to increase your awareness of your body and your emotions in the present moment. This can help you catch yourself *before* you engage in the behavior.  Apps like Calm, Headspace, or Insight Timer can be helpful.
   * **Body Scan Meditation:** Specifically focus on bringing awareness to different parts of your body, noticing sensations without judgment.

2. **Develop Alternative Coping Mechanisms (The Replacement Strategy):** This is *crucial*. You need to find things that can fulfill the same need as head-hitting – grounding, emotional release, distraction – but in a healthy way.  Experiment and see what works for *you*:
   * **Grounding Techniques:**
      * **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
      * **Deep Breathing:**  Box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4) or diaphragmatic breathing (belly breathing).",0.5379195809364319,3.525455257027887e-155,0.10996563573883161,0.2915081756055346
"My husband and I had our first threesome recently. Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me.    He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better, and now I'm craving more of it. But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling. Why am I feeling this way?","You need to have an honest conversation with each other about WHY you both want a threesome. Evaluate the status of your relationship with each other. Are you having issues? Fighting? Not feeling satisfied with each other? How has your sex life been with each other?  If there are any problems, insecurities, issues, introducing something like this may only make your relationship worse. Open relationships and threesomes rarely work out well. Sure, there are some who successfully live this lifestyle, but it only works when both people are completely secure in their relationship with each other, harbor no jealousies or insecurities, and aren't looking to someone else to satisfy needs that aren't getting met by their spouse. Let me say that again: This is not likely to work out well for you if either of you are insecure, jealous, or looking to have needs met by this other person that you aren't getting from your spouse. That empty feeling you're having - listen to it. Dig deep to find out where it is coming from. What thoughts are going through your head when you feel that way? You'll get the answer.The other thing that helps make something like this work is for both of you to listen and respect each other. If you don't like it that he paid more attention to the other girl, he needs to know that, and he needs to respect that.  If you're going to do it again, he needs to know what you're comfortable with and what you want. Set the limits before you're in the moment, before it's too late to take an action back. Turn it around and ask him what he would be comfortable with if it were a man instead of a woman.It is perfectly natural to be curious and want to experiment. A lot of people get that out of the way before settling down in a monogamous relationship. People who marry young and/or inexperienced may still feel that curiosity about things like that and want to experience them, but don't want to hurt their spouse. The REASON you are both doing this matters a lot. If there are problems in your relationship, this is likely to only make things worse.","Okay, this is a really common and complex experience, and it's good you're taking the time to explore your feelings. It's great that you and your husband communicated afterward, and that talking helped initially. The fact that you're now experiencing this ""empty feeling"" *before* things get close is a significant clue and deserves attention. Here's a breakdown of potential reasons, broken down into categories, along with things to consider.  I will also include a disclaimer at the end.

**1. Emotional Complexity of Opening a Relationship (Even for One Time):**

* **Core Beliefs & Values:** Even if you intellectually agreed to a threesome, it can challenge deeply held beliefs about monogamy, intimacy, and your relationship. That challenge can manifest as anxiety or emptiness.  This is especially true if you were raised with strong traditional views.
* **Feeling ""Not Enough"":**  Even if *you* initiated or were enthusiastic, a part of you might be grappling with the idea of needing to share attention or feeling like you weren't ""enough"" for your husband, even temporarily. This isn't about blaming yourself, but recognizing a vulnerable feeling.  The fact he was with the other person ""more"" likely amplified this.
* **Loss of Specialness:**  Intimacy is often built on a feeling of unique connection. Introducing a third person, even once, can temporarily disrupt that feeling of specialness.  It's natural to grieve a little shift in that dynamic.
* **Unspoken Expectations:** What did you *expect* the experience to be like? Were those expectations met? Sometimes the gap between expectation and reality can lead to feeling disappointed or empty, even if the experience itself wasn’t bad.
* **Security and Attachment:**  Even in open relationships, secure attachment is vital.  The experience might have triggered insecurities about your connection with your husband, even if he reassures you.



**2. The Role of Alcohol & the Specifics of the Experience:**

* **Alcohol's Impact:** Alcohol lowers inhibitions, but it also muddies emotions. It can create a sense of euphoria in the moment that doesn't translate to lasting satisfaction. You might be processing the experience *without* the haze of alcohol, and seeing it more clearly.
* **Power Dynamics:**  You mentioned he was with the other person ""more.""  Did that feel okay *in the moment*?  Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, we don't fully register imbalances. Now, with distance, you might be realizing you felt left out or less prioritized.  This is important to unpack.
* **Emotional Connection (or Lack Thereof) with the Third Person:** Was there any genuine emotional connection with the other person? If it was purely physical, that can leave a feeling of emptiness.  Intimacy isn't just about sex; it's about connection.
* **Post-Event Come-Down:**  Similar to a post-party feeling, there can be a letdown after a highly stimulating experience, especially one that involves breaking from the norm.

**3. The Craving & the Anticipatory Anxiety:**

* **Dopamine & Reward:** The threesome likely released a lot of dopamine (the ""feel-good"" hormone). Your brain might be craving that dopamine rush again.  However, the *anticipation* of that rush can also trigger anxiety if you're unsure about the circumstances or your feelings.
* **The Empty Feeling as a Warning Sign:** Your ""empty feeling"" *before* things get close could be your subconscious mind signaling that something isn't quite right. It's a protective mechanism, prompting you to pause and assess your needs and boundaries.
* **Fear of Repeating Uncomfortable Feelings:** You enjoyed the conversation afterward that helped you feel better, but you might subconsciously be afraid of *not* being able to resolve any discomfort if it arises again.




**What to Do – Exploring & Communicating:**

1. **Journaling:**  Write down your thoughts and feelings *before, during, and after* the thought of another experience.  What specifically triggers the emptiness? What are you hoping to gain?  What are you afraid of?

2. **Deepen Communication with Your Husband:**
   * **Beyond ""Did you enjoy it?"":**  Talk about your feelings honestly and vulnerably.  Use ""I"" statements: ""I felt a little left out when..."" or ""I'm feeling anxious about repeating the experience because...""
   * **Discuss Boundaries:**  Clearly define what you *both* want and *don't* want in future encounters. This includes emotional boundaries, physical boundaries, and how you'll handle things if someone feels uncomfortable.  Specifically address the imbalance you noticed.
   * **Explore Motivations:** Why do *both* of you want to repeat this? Is it about sexual exploration, a desire for novelty",0.5531125068664551,9.983887888352223e-79,0.14375561545372867,0.2904579698457092
"I'm in my mid 20s with a husband and children. I love my family, but I feel like I've lost my identity, and I don't know who I am other than a mom and wife. At times, all I can think is what I gave up and how I feel unhappy and trapped, but I know I'd feel like worse without them. I loathe myself at times. I have an amazing life, so why can't I just enjoy it?","It is not easy being a wife and mother. You have shifted roles in your life. You went from having a career to focusing on your family. Transitioning can be hard, especially when we feel we gave something up that we really wanted. I want to acknowledge you for wanting to be the best wife and mother you can. I think it is great that you are self-aware and want to work on this.Feeling ""unhappy and trapped"" may also mean that you are  believing these negative thoughts are absolutely true. We have lots and lots of thoughts throughout the day. Sometimes we pay a lot of attention to some and some we ignore. Right now these thoughts are getting a lot of your attention and perhaps you are thinking because you are thinking them they are true.  Is it really true that you trapped? You also said that you have an amazing life. It doesn't sound like you are only having negative thoughts. You have some positive ones, too. However, you are giving a lot of weight to the negative thoughts, more weight than the positive ones.I also wonder if you are struggling with the fact that you are even having this thought. One thing that can be helpful is to recognize that you are having a thought, that it is a negative thought, that thinking it does not make it true, and to let it go. This is the basis for mindfulness work that can be really helpful. It is a great place for you to start so you can balance out your thoughts and emotions.Best of luck to you!","Okay, this is *incredibly* common, and you are absolutely not alone in feeling this way. It sounds like you're experiencing a classic case of what's often called ""matrescence"" - the process of becoming a mother, which is a huge identity shift, and often isn't talked about enough. It's not just about the physical changes, it's a complete rewiring of your life and sense of self. And layered on top of that is being a wife, and navigating all that entails. It's a lot.

It's also *very* telling that you recognize how amazing your life is *and* you're struggling with these feelings. That awareness is important. The fact that you feel guilt on top of the unhappiness is also completely normal.  You're a good person who cares deeply, and that's contributing to the complexity of your emotions.

Let's break down what you're saying and then talk about some ways to navigate this. Here's what I'm hearing:

* **Loss of Identity:** This is the core issue. Before kids, you had dreams, hobbies, interests, maybe a career path you were on. Those things didn't just disappear, but they've likely been pushed to the side, and you feel like they're no longer *you*.  You're defined primarily by your roles, rather than your individual self.
* **Ambivalence & Guilt:** You love your family, and you *know* you'd be worse off without them. But the ""what ifs"" and the grief for the life you envisioned are powerful. Feeling trapped is a strong emotion, and it’s okay to acknowledge it.  The guilt comes from feeling like you *should* be happy with such a good life.
* **Self-Loathing:** This is serious.  Loathing yourself for feeling unhappy when you ""should"" be content is a vicious cycle.  It's a sign that these feelings are deeply impacting your self-worth.
* **The ""Why Can't I Just..."" Question:** This is the million-dollar question.  It's not about a lack of appreciation; it's about unmet needs.  You're a human being with needs beyond being a wife and mother, and those needs aren’t being met.



**Here's what I suggest, broken down into actionable steps.  This isn't a quick fix, but a journey of rediscovery.**

**1. Validate Your Feelings:**

* **Stop the ""Shoulds"":**  Seriously.  Erase ""I *should* be happy"" from your vocabulary. Feelings aren't right or wrong; they just *are*.  It's okay to feel sad, frustrated, lost, even angry.  Allow yourself to feel those things without judgment.
* **Journaling:** This is a powerful tool.  Write down everything – the good, the bad, the ugly.  Don’t censor yourself.  Just let it flow. It can help you identify patterns and understand the roots of your feelings.
* **Talk to Someone (Professional Help):**  This is *highly* recommended. A therapist can provide a safe, non-judgmental space to explore these feelings and develop coping strategies.  Postpartum isn't just about the months after birth; these identity shifts can happen years later. Look for someone specializing in postpartum adjustment, maternal mental health, or identity work.  Even a few sessions can be incredibly helpful.

**2. Reclaim Your Identity – Small Steps Matter:**

* **Remember ""You"" Before:**  Think back to what you enjoyed *before* kids. What were your passions?  What made you feel alive?  It doesn't have to be grand things – reading, painting, hiking, volunteering, a particular type of music.
* **Micro-Hobbies:** Start *small*.  Seriously small. 15-30 minutes a day dedicated to something *just for you*.  It could be:
    * Reading a chapter of a book
    * Listening to a podcast
    * Doing a quick workout
    * Painting/drawing/writing
    * Taking a bath
    *  Learning a new skill online (even 5 minutes a day!)
* **Schedule It:** Treat this time like an important appointment.  Put it in your calendar and protect it.  This is *not* selfish; it's self-preservation.
* **Reconnect with Old Friends:**  Friendships can fade when you have young children, but they're vital for your well-being.  Make an effort to reach out and reconnect with friends who knew you *before* you were a mom.
* **Explore New Interests:**  Maybe your old hobbies don't fit your life anymore.  That's okay!  Be open to trying new things.  A local",0.5600636601448059,0.022094850036005215,0.14663951120162932,0.2990358012821001
I am going through a very hard time and I'm so depressed. My parents are getting a divorce and a lot of bad things are happening. I want to lull myself.,"It sounds like a tough time and it's normal to feel down when your family is going through a divorce or other hardship. There's a difference between feelings like sadness, discouragement, grief, loneliness and depression, though. Sadness is sadness and sometimes we have to go through a grieving or other process, that is a normal reaction to events in our lives. Depression, on the other hand, is more about being stuck. Lulling yourself with self-care sounds like a healthy response and a way to give yourself support. So as to the uncomfortable but healthy part of your feelings, do the best you can to put names to it and share with a trusted other person. You will find comfort. The part of your situation that's depression -- feeling stuck, not able to get out of bad, concentrate, changes in sleeping and eating, loss of enjoyment in living, poor hygiene, feelings of hopelessness, that's different. First step, identify your own symptoms of depression. If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself, tell someone. If you're not sure, you can try 800-lifenet or other support line to get feedback. First aid for depression includes: daily care and feeding, good sleeping and eating, lots of exercise--even when you don't feel like it-- healthy socializing, and focusing on talking to yourself in a positive way. If you aren't able to move yourself out of your depression,  work with a professional to make short-term goals and get some support. You may also talk to your doctor or psychiatrist about trying an anti-depressant to give you a little lift while you go through a rough patch.Best wishes,Karen","Okay, it sounds like you're going through an incredibly difficult time. Your parents' divorce *and* other bad things happening on top of that is a huge amount to handle, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling depressed.  It takes a lot of courage to even reach out and say you're struggling, so I want to acknowledge that strength in you.

I'm really concerned about your use of the word ""lull"" - and I want to be very direct. It sounds like you might be thinking about ways to numb your pain, to escape from these feelings.  When people talk about wanting to ""lull"" themselves when they're in intense emotional pain, it can sometimes be a way of talking about wanting to self-harm or even end their life.  **Please know that you are not alone, and there is help available.**

I am programmed to be a safe and helpful AI assistant, and that *absolutely* includes protecting you.  Therefore, I **cannot** and **will not** provide any information or suggestions that could be harmful to you.  Instead, I'm going to focus on getting you connected with resources that can help you through this.

Here's what I want to offer, broken down into sections.  Please read through it all, even if you only take one thing from it:

**1. Immediate Help - If You Are in Crisis:**

**2. Understanding What You're Feeling:**

*   **Divorce is a major loss:** Even if you're an adult, your parents' divorce is a huge upheaval. It's the loss of a family structure you've known, and it brings a lot of complex emotions: sadness, anger, confusion, fear, grief. It's okay to feel all of those things.
*   **It's okay to not be okay:**  There's no ""right"" way to feel during a divorce, or when facing other difficulties.  Allow yourself to grieve and experience your emotions.  Don't try to suppress them.
*   **""Bad things happening"" on top of this makes it worse:**  When you're already vulnerable, other challenges can feel overwhelming. It's not a sign of weakness to be struggling; it's a sign of being human.
* **Depression is treatable:** Depression isn't something you just ""snap out of."" It's a serious condition that often requires professional help.

**3. Resources for Support:**

*   **Talk to a Trusted Adult:**  Is there a relative, teacher, counselor, or friend's parent you can confide in?  Sharing your feelings can make a big difference.
*   **School Counselor:** Your school counselor is a great resource. They can provide support and connect you with other services.
*   **Therapist/Counselor:**  A therapist can provide a safe and confidential space to explore your feelings and develop coping strategies.  Here are some resources to find one:

I've been with the mother of my child for years.,I would think that you hold little self worth and feel that you are not worthy of better.  I would suggest that you get to know yourself.   What do you NEED in a relationship?  What is holding you to this relationship other than your child?  What have gone on in the relationship that makes you think or feel you deserve such disrespect?  Just a few questions to ask yourself..,"Okay. That's a significant statement, and it sounds like you might be navigating a complex situation.  It's good you're reaching out, even if just to start talking.  To help me understand how I can *best* help you, could you tell me a little more about what's on your mind?  I understand you may not want to share everything, and that's okay.  But even a little more information will help me tailor my response.  For example, are you:

* **Generally doing well and just reflecting?**  Sometimes people just want to talk about their long-term relationship with a co-parent.
* **Facing a specific challenge?**  Like communication issues, disagreements about parenting, financial strain, or changes in your relationship?
* **Considering a change in your relationship?**  Are you thinking about separation or divorce?
* **Dealing with emotional distress?**  Are you feeling stressed, anxious, sad, or overwhelmed?
* **Looking for advice on a particular issue?** (e.g., co-parenting schedules, legal questions, etc.)
* **Just needing to vent?**



**Here are some general things I *can* offer, regardless of the specifics, knowing you've been with your child's mother for years:**

* **Acknowledging the complexity:** Long-term relationships, especially those involving children, are rarely simple. There's a lot of history, shared responsibility, and likely a lot of emotions involved.
* **Importance of communication:**  Open and honest communication (even when difficult) is crucial, both for your relationship with your child's mother *and* for your child's well-being.
* **Prioritizing the child:**  Regardless of the state of your relationship with your child's mother, your child's needs should be the central focus.
* **Self-care:**  Taking care of your own emotional and mental health is vital, especially during challenging times.
* **Resources:** I can point you to resources for co-parenting, mediation, therapy, and legal information (though I am *not* a substitute for professional advice in those areas).



**Please know:** I am an AI and cannot provide legal, financial, or medical advice.  I'm here to listen and offer support and information, but always consult with qualified professionals for those types of needs.

"I've got so much anger. I don't know how to control myself. My girlfriend screams at me all the time, and sometime I don't know how to deal with life. I'm very depressed and angry. I feel lost.","Hi Campbell River, You say you have anger but you don't mention how it shows. Or maybe it doesn't. Are you aggressive with your girlfriend? Since you mention depression, I wonder if you're bottling it all up somewhere instead of letting it show at all. If this is the case, I admire your ability to not lash out at someone who's hurting you. However, if they are totally  unexpressed, anger turn inward and shift into depression. When she yells at you, what do you do? Is this the moment that you feel the most angry? I wouldn't be surprised; anger is a normal response to someone yelling at you. Something about anger...it's often there to cover up our more vulnerable emotions. Under the anger I wonder if you feel worthless, powerless, scared, unloved. Part of the trick to reducing anger is identifying those other emotions and expressing them. You say you don't know how to deal with life, and I think maybe you mean you don't know how to deal with emotions. Lots of people don't! This is confusing for most of us. What am I feeling? Why is it so strong? I'm afraid to express it for fear of hurting someone (or falling apart, or feeling alone...). How do I know what to express and what to be quiet about? These are all great questions to ask yourself, and a qualified therapist can help you sort it all out and support you in your growth. I wish you well!","Okay, that sounds incredibly difficult. It takes a lot of courage to admit you're struggling with anger, depression, and feeling lost, so thank you for sharing that. It's clear you're in a lot of pain, and it's completely understandable why you're feeling overwhelmed.  Let's break this down and talk about some things that might help.  I'm going to give you a lot of information, and I'll try to organize it.  Please read through it all, and at the end, I'll emphasize the *most important* thing to do.

**First, let's acknowledge what you're experiencing.**

* **Anger:** Anger is often a *secondary* emotion. It often masks underlying feelings like hurt, fear, frustration, or sadness.  It's a signal that something isn't right, that a boundary is being crossed, or that you're feeling powerless.  It's not inherently bad, but *how* you express it is crucial.
* **Depression:**  Depression saps your energy, motivation, and hope. It can make everything feel harder and can significantly impact your ability to cope with stress.  It's not a sign of weakness; it's a genuine health condition.
* **Feeling Lost:** This often comes with depression and difficult life circumstances.  When you're struggling, it's hard to see a path forward.
* **Your Girlfriend's Behavior:**  Being screamed *at* by someone you love is *never* okay. It's a form of emotional abuse, and it's incredibly damaging to your self-esteem and mental health.  This is a critical piece of the puzzle.



**Let's talk about dealing with the anger.**  Here are some techniques.  These take practice, so don't get discouraged if they don't work instantly.

* **Recognize Your Triggers:** What situations, words, or thoughts tend to set you off?  Keeping a journal can help you identify patterns.
* **Early Warning Signs:** What happens *before* you get really angry? Do you feel your heart racing?  Do you clench your fists?  Become aware of these physical sensations. Recognizing them early gives you a chance to intervene.
* **Cool-Down Techniques:**  These are things you can do *in the moment* when you feel your anger rising:
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system.  Try the 4-7-8 technique: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8.
    * **Time Out:**  Remove yourself from the situation.  Go for a walk, listen to music, or simply go to another room.  Tell your girlfriend (calmly, if possible) that you need some space.
    * **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:**  Tense and release different muscle groups in your body.
    * **Mindfulness:**  Focus on your senses – what do you see, hear, smell, taste, and touch?  This can ground you in the present moment.
* **Long-Term Strategies:**
    * **Exercise:** Physical activity is a great stress reliever.
    * **Healthy Diet:**  What you eat affects your mood.
    * **Sufficient Sleep:**  Lack of sleep exacerbates anger and depression.
    * **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be cathartic.
    * **Hobbies:**  Engage in activities you enjoy.



**Now, let's address the depression and feeling lost.**

* **Professional Help is Crucial:**  I'm going to say this again later, but it's the most important thing.  A therapist can help you understand the root causes of your depression, develop coping mechanisms, and find a sense of purpose.
* **Small Steps:** When you're depressed, even small tasks can feel overwhelming. Break things down into manageable steps. Instead of ""clean the house,"" try ""wash one dish.""
* **Social Connection:**  Even if you don't feel like it, try to connect with friends or family.  Isolation can worsen depression.
* **Self-Compassion:**  Be kind to yourself.  You're going through a lot.  Don't beat yourself up for struggling.
* **Goal Setting:**  Start with small, achievable goals.  This can give you a sense of accomplishment and hope.



**Regarding your girlfriend's screaming... This is unacceptable.**

* **It's Abuse:**  Screaming *at* someone consistently is a form of emotional abuse.  It erodes your self-worth and creates a toxic environment.
* **You Deserve Respect:**  You deserve to be treated with kindness and respect, even during disagreements.
* **Communication is Key (",0.5644282698631287,0.017050531849804446,0.13475935828877006,0.31039112311452877
Does counseling really do anything that can help people?,"Hi!  Great question.  I believe counseling does help people! Of course, I am a therapist, so I would think that! :)  Seriously - I think therapy and counseling allow us to understand ourselves, our motivations and the things that bring us happiness and discontent.  Therapy can create opportunities to try new skills and enhance positive attributes that are already present in someone.  I like to think of therapy as an unbiased ""aerial view"" of our lives. Someone outside can often help us notice things we might otherwise miss. Hope this helps!","Okay, let's break down the big question of whether counseling really helps. It's a really valid question, and the answer is... complex, but generally **yes, counseling can be very helpful for a lot of people.** However, it's not a magic bullet, and the *how* and *for whom* are important. Here's a comprehensive look, covering the evidence, what it helps with, factors influencing effectiveness, and things to keep in mind:

**1. The Evidence Base: Does it work, scientifically?**

* **Extensive Research:** There's a *huge* body of research on the effectiveness of counseling (also often called psychotherapy).  It's been studied for decades.
* **Effect Sizes:**  The good news is that, on average, counseling *does* produce positive change.  However, the *size* of that change (called ""effect size"") is often described as ""moderate."" This means people generally get better, but it's not always a dramatic overnight fix.  It's more common to see gradual improvement.
* **Compared to What?**  A key thing researchers look at is *compared to what* is counseling effective?
    * **No Treatment:**  Counseling is almost always more effective than receiving no help at all.
    * **Placebo:** It's generally more effective than a placebo (like a sugar pill, but in therapy form - e.g., just talking to someone without any specific therapeutic technique). This shows that something *specific* about therapy is working, not just the hope or the relationship.
    * **Medication:**  For some conditions (like severe depression), medication may have a faster initial impact. But for many issues, the effects of counseling tend to last longer than medication alone.  Often, a combination of both is most effective.
* **Specific Therapies:**  Different types of therapy have different levels of evidence for specific problems (more on that below).



**2. What Can Counseling Help With? (A LOT!)**

Counseling isn't just for ""crazy"" people or crises. It can help with a remarkably wide range of issues:

* **Mental Health Conditions:**
    * **Depression:**  Very effective, especially Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Interpersonal Therapy (IPT).
    * **Anxiety:**  CBT, Exposure Therapy, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) are all well-supported.  Includes Generalized Anxiety, Social Anxiety, Panic Disorder, Phobias.
    * **Trauma & PTSD:**  Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) and Trauma-Focused CBT are specifically designed for this.
    * **Bipolar Disorder:** Counseling is often used *in conjunction with* medication to manage mood swings and develop coping strategies.
    * **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is a highly effective form of CBT.
    * **Eating Disorders:**  A combination of individual, family, and group therapy is often used.
* **Life Challenges & Difficulties:**
    * **Relationship Problems:** Couples therapy, family therapy, and individual therapy to improve communication and resolve conflicts.
    * **Grief & Loss:**  Provides support and helps navigate the grieving process.
    * **Stress Management:**  Learning coping mechanisms to deal with daily stressors.
    * **Career Issues:**  Exploring career options, dealing with job stress, improving work-life balance.
    * **Low Self-Esteem:**  Building self-confidence and self-worth.
    * **Difficult Life Transitions:**  Adjusting to major changes like divorce, moving, or job loss.
    * **Addiction:**  Often part of a broader recovery plan, helping address underlying issues and develop relapse prevention strategies.
    * **Anger Management:** Learning to regulate emotions and express anger in healthy ways.
    * **Parenting Challenges:**  Developing effective parenting skills.




**3. Different Types of Therapy: A Quick Overview**

The ""counseling"" umbrella covers many approaches. Here are a few common ones:

* **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. Very practical and goal-oriented. (Good for: Anxiety, Depression, OCD, Phobias)
* **Psychodynamic Therapy:**  Explores unconscious patterns and past experiences to understand present behavior.  (Good for:  Deep-seated emotional issues, relationship patterns)
* **Humanistic Therapy (e.g., Person-Centered Therapy):**  Emphasizes empathy, unconditional positive regard, and the client's inherent capacity for growth. (Good for: Self-exploration, personal growth)
* **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):**  A type of CBT that focuses on emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and mindfulness.",0.49830955266952515,2.2618619655675764e-155,0.06406685236768803,0.17487508922198433
"My mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back, and I can't seem to forgive her. I want to say that it's okay, but I can't. I feel like even if I did forgive her, I wouldn't be able to say it to her face.","How someone feels when they forgive another, is at peace with themselves and their understanding of what went wrong, who was responsible for what in the situation, and clarity on their own motivation, actions, emotions including pain, regret, resentment, sadness.These steps ideally allow a new door to open in order to develop new paths in the existing relationship or accept that this will not be possible due to either person's way of handling themselves.The long answer would be that you're not yet through with this process.I commend you on being truthful with yourself about yourself.You're on the right track by expecting to feel resolved when you've reached resolution, and not before.Finding patience with the unpredictable amount of time needed to thoroughly examine all the details of the incidents you mention, sometimes is a frustration of its own.Keep up your good work of knowing your own life.It is a worthwhile endeavor!","Okay, this is really common and really tough. It's incredibly brave of you to even acknowledge this – that you *want* to forgive, but you're stuck, and that you recognize the difficulty of even saying the words. It's a sign of a lot of internal struggle and a desire for healing. Let's break this down. Here's a look at why you might be feeling this way, and some thoughts on how to move forward, even if ""saying it"" feels impossible right now.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Forgiveness is a Process, Not an Event:**  It's not a switch you flip. It's more like layers peeling away over time. You're not ""failing"" at forgiveness because you don't feel it instantly.  The fact that you *want* to forgive suggests the process has begun, even if it's slow.
* **The Weight of the Mistakes:**  ""A lot of mistakes"" is vague, but it tells me these weren't small things.  Significant hurts take significant time to process.  The depth of the pain directly correlates to how long forgiveness will take.
* **The Disconnect Between Feeling and Expression:** You can *feel* something internally evolving (a softening, a lessening of anger) without being able to vocalize it.  This is incredibly normal. There are a lot of reasons for this disconnect (see below).
* **Fear of Vulnerability:**  Saying ""I forgive you"" is *extremely* vulnerable. It opens you up to the possibility of further hurt, of her not understanding, or even of her repeating the behavior.
* **Protecting Yourself:**  Not being able to say it face-to-face could be a self-protective mechanism. Your subconscious might be saying, ""I'm not ready to fully trust, and I need to keep a boundary in place.""
* **Unresolved Emotions:** There might be anger, sadness, disappointment, or a sense of betrayal that haven't been fully acknowledged or processed.  Forgiveness can't truly happen until those feelings are addressed.
* **Her Response (Anticipated or Past):** Have you tried to discuss these issues before, and did her response make you feel invalidated or unheard? If so, that could be a huge reason why you hesitate.



**Why Saying It to Her Face Is So Hard**

* **Fear of Her Reaction:** Will she be genuinely remorseful? Defensive? Dismissive?  The anticipation of a negative reaction can be paralyzing.
* **Fear of Re-traumatization:** Talking about it might *feel* like reliving the hurt.
* **Power Dynamics:** Is there an existing dynamic in your relationship where she tends to control the narrative or minimize your feelings?
* **Difficulty Articulating the Pain:**  It can be hard to put into words the specific ways you were hurt and how they impacted you.
* **Need for Control:**  You might feel more control by keeping your feelings contained, rather than risking them being exposed.




**What You Can Do (Even Without Saying ""I Forgive You"")**

This is the important part. You don't *have* to say the words to begin healing.

1. **Focus on Your Own Healing:** This is the most important step. Forgiveness is ultimately for *you*, not for her.  
   * **Journaling:** Write down your feelings, your memories, your anger, your sadness.  Don't censor yourself. This is for your eyes only.
   * **Therapy:**  A therapist can provide a safe space to explore your emotions, develop coping mechanisms, and work through the forgiveness process.  (This is *highly* recommended, especially if the mistakes were significant.)
   * **Self-Care:**  Engage in activities that nurture you and bring you joy.  This helps build resilience.
   * **Mindfulness/Meditation:**  These practices can help you become more aware of your emotions without getting overwhelmed by them.

2. **Shift Your Focus from Forgiveness to Acceptance & Boundaries:**  Sometimes, *acceptance* is a more attainable goal than forgiveness, especially in the short term.  
    * **Acceptance:**  Accepting that what happened *did* happen, that it was wrong, and that it had a lasting impact on you.  Acceptance isn't condoning; it's acknowledging reality.
    * **Boundaries:**  This is crucial.  Regardless of whether you forgive her, you have the right to set boundaries to protect yourself.  This might mean:
        * Limiting contact.
        * Not discussing certain topics.
        * Having clear expectations for how she treats you.
        * Saying ""no"" without guilt.

3. **Experiment with Other Forms of Communication (If You Want):**  If you",0.5117712616920471,2.5464350384983684e-155,0.0979020979020979,0.243098093935374
"I’m in my early 20s. My ex’s parents are friends with them and have told them bad things about me. I left my ex due to an abusive situation, and they are making me look like I was the bad one.","Maybe you can talk with your partner about this first look at the different elements of a possible conversation in the future. If you are at a place where you are willing or able to disclose the reason that you left your ex, that could be one element of the discussion, but it doesn't have to be.I don't know how long we have been together with your current partner, but perhaps his or her parents would see you for who you are and make their own opinions over time. That may be a discussion to have with them as well.Hopefully your partner will be a good sounding board before these conversations.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and unfortunately, not uncommon. It's incredibly frustrating and painful when the people who *should* be understanding are instead perpetuating a false narrative, especially after you left an abusive relationship. Here's a breakdown of how to navigate this, covering emotional coping, what you can realistically do, and things to avoid.  I'll also break it down into sections for clarity.

**1. Understanding the Dynamics & Why This Is Happening**

* **Loyalty Bias:**  Parents often have a very strong loyalty to their child, even (and sometimes *especially*) when their child is in the wrong.  They may be struggling to accept that their child was abusive, and it's easier for them to blame you than to confront uncomfortable truths.
* **Protecting Their Image of Their Child:** Admitting their child behaved abusively can be devastating to their self-perception and how they present their family to the world.  They might be actively trying to preserve a certain image.
* **Limited Information/One-Sided Story:** They're only hearing one side of the story – their child's. Abusers are often skilled at manipulation and portraying themselves as the victim. They're likely feeding their parents a distorted version of events.
* **Lack of Understanding of Abuse:**  Many people don’t understand the dynamics of abusive relationships.  They may minimize what happened or believe harmful myths (like ""both people are responsible"").
* **Their Own Investment in the Relationship:** They may have envisioned a future with you as their son/daughter-in-law and are grieving that loss (though that doesn't excuse their behavior).



**2. Emotional Coping – Taking Care of *You***

This is the most important part.  Their actions are about *them*, not about *you*.

* **Validate Your Own Experience:**  You *know* what happened.  You lived it. Their opinions don't invalidate your reality. Repeat this to yourself: ""I know the truth. My feelings are valid. I deserve to be treated with respect.""
* **Grieve the Loss of the Relationship *and* the Lost Support:** You're grieving the abusive relationship, *and* you're grieving the loss of potential support from people who should have been supportive. This is a double loss, and it's okay to feel sad, angry, and frustrated.
* **Limit Contact (as much as possible):** This is crucial.  Don't engage with them directly.  Don't try to defend yourself.  It won't change their minds, and it will only reopen wounds. This is incredibly hard, but necessary for your peace.  If you absolutely *must* be in the same space (e.g., a mutual friend's event), keep interactions brief and polite but distant.
* **Lean on Your Support System:** Talk to trusted friends, family members, a therapist, or a support group.  Share what's happening and allow yourself to be comforted and believed.
* **Therapy:** Seriously consider therapy. A therapist can provide you with tools to process the abuse, cope with the aftermath, and build healthy boundaries.  They can also help you develop strategies for dealing with this specific situation. (See resources at the end).
* **Self-Care:**  Prioritize activities that nourish your well-being.  This could be anything from exercise and healthy eating to spending time in nature, reading, listening to music, or pursuing hobbies.



**3. What You Can (and Can't) Do – Realistic Strategies**

* **You Can't Control Their Opinions:** This is the hardest thing to accept, but it's the truth. You cannot force them to see things your way. Trying to do so will only exhaust you and likely make things worse.
* **Consider a *Very* Limited, Carefully Crafted Statement (Maybe):** This is optional and depends on your comfort level.  If you feel compelled to say something, keep it brief, factual, and focused on *your* experience, not on blaming their son/daughter.  For example: ""I'm sorry they've shared a different perspective. I made the difficult decision to leave the relationship because it was unhealthy for me, and I needed to prioritize my well-being."" *Then, stop.* Do not engage in further discussion.  This isn't about convincing them; it's about setting your own boundary and stating your truth once.  **I recommend against this unless you feel very strong and prepared for it to be ineffective or even backfire.**
* **Focus on Your Own Reputation:** The best way to counter a false narrative is to live a life that demonstrates your character.  Be kind, responsible, and authentic in your interactions with others. Let your actions speak for themselves.
* **Protect Your Boundaries with Your Ex:**  Ensure you have absolutely no",0.4892843961715698,2.9424272948317067e-155,0.09027777777777778,0.2630511611358049
How does a person start the counseling process?,"I'd recommend looking on psychologtoday.com, reading the bio's of potential therapists who you think you would relate best with, then contact them through e-mail or on the phone.","Okay, let's break down how a person can start the counseling process. It can feel daunting, so I'll try to be thorough and cover different avenues. Here's a step-by-step guide, covering everything from recognizing you need help to actually attending sessions:

**1. Recognizing the Need & Initial Self-Reflection**

* **Identify What's Bothering You:** This is the first and often hardest step.  What's leading you to consider counseling? Is it:
    * **Specific issues:** Anxiety, depression, relationship problems, grief, trauma, addiction, stress, work issues, parenting challenges, etc.
    * **General feelings:**  A persistent sense of unhappiness, feeling overwhelmed, difficulty coping, loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, feeling stuck.
    * **Life transitions:**  Major changes like a job loss, divorce, moving, becoming a parent, etc.
    * **Behavioral changes:**  Changes in sleep, appetite, energy levels, social withdrawal, increased irritability.
* **Assess Severity:**  How much is this impacting your daily life?  Is it interfering with work, relationships, self-care?  If you're having thoughts of harming yourself or others, *skip ahead to the ""Emergency Support"" section at the end*.
* **Consider Your Goals:** What do you *hope* to achieve through counseling?  This doesn't need to be super specific, but having a general idea can be helpful.  Examples: ""I want to feel less anxious,"" ""I want to improve my communication skills in my relationship,"" ""I want to cope with my grief in a healthy way.""



**2.  Exploring Options & Finding a Counselor**

This is where it starts to get practical. There are many ways to find a counselor:

* **Your Insurance Provider:** *This is often the best first step if you have insurance.*
    * **Website/Member Portal:**  Most insurance companies have a directory of ""in-network"" providers (counselors who accept your insurance).  You can usually search by specialty (e.g., anxiety, couples counseling), location, and sometimes even gender or language.
    * **Member Services:** Call the number on your insurance card and ask them for a list of in-network mental health providers.  Ask about your coverage for mental health services (copay, deductible, number of sessions covered).
* **Online Directories:** These are great resources, even if you have insurance, to get a broader view.
    * **Psychology Today:**  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists)  (Very popular, lots of filters)
    * **GoodTherapy:** [https://www.goodtherapy.org/](https://www.goodtherapy.org/) (Focuses on ethical and responsible therapy)
    * **Open Path Collective:** [https://openpathcollective.org/](https://openpathcollective.org/) (Offers affordable therapy options for those without insurance or with high deductibles)
    * **Zocdoc:** [https://www.zocdoc.com/](https://www.zocdoc.com/) (Can filter by insurance and availability)
* **Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs):**  If your employer offers an EAP, it usually provides a limited number of free counseling sessions.
* **University Counseling Centers:** If you're a student, your university likely has a counseling center.
* **Community Mental Health Centers:**  These often offer lower-cost services on a sliding scale based on income.  (Search online for ""[your city/county] mental health services"").
* **Referrals:** Ask your primary care doctor, friends, or family members if they have any recommendations (if you're comfortable doing so).

**3.  Considering Counselor Qualities & ""Fit""**

* **Credentials:**  Look for licensed professionals. Common credentials include:
    * **LCSW (Licensed Clinical Social Worker):**  Focuses on the person in their environment and practical problem-solving.
    * **LMFT (Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist):** Specializes in relationships and family dynamics.
    * **LPC (Licensed Professional Counselor):**  A broad license covering a range of counseling approaches.
    * **Psychologist (PhD or PsyD):**  Doctoral-level training, often specializing in assessment and psychological testing.  Can also provide therapy.
    * **Psychiatrist (MD):**  A medical doctor who can prescribe medication.  Often works in conjunction with therapists.
* **Specialty:**  Choose a counselor who specializes in the issues you're facing. (e.g., trauma-informed care, anxiety disorders, addiction).
* **Therapeutic Approach:**",0.42716819047927856,1.2231274922863232e-155,0.03400309119010819,0.11742892459826948
"I find that I imagine things sexually, and I hate it because it puts strain on my relationship. I feel helpless and guilty. I want it to go away, and I want to make my woman happy again.","It is completely understandable that you would like to find a way to make these intrusive thoughts go away, however, your feeling that you can't control having these thoughts is accurate. It's also understandable that you would feel helpless and guilty, given that you see how these thoughts are effecting your relationship, though I would encourage you to go easy on yourself and remember that you aren't choosing to have these thoughts. I'm sure that if there was a switch to turn them off, you would flip it.There is no magic technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away, however, therapy may still have a lot to offer. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into where these thoughts are coming from and develop new ways of relating to them so that they do not leave you feeling as helpless and guilty and can be more present with your partner. Though there is no guarantee that the thoughts will go away, this may also be a result of work with a therapist. Either way, you may be able to find a way to deal with the thoughts and show up in your relationship in a way that will be satisfying to you and your partner.","Okay, this is a really brave thing to share, and it's good you're recognizing this is causing you distress and impacting your relationship. It's also understandable to feel helpless and guilty.  Let's break down what you're experiencing and explore some ways to navigate this.  I'm going to give you a lot of information, and it's important to remember that this is a process, not a quick fix.  I will also include a disclaimer at the end, as I am an AI and cannot provide therapy.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Fantasy is Normal:** First and foremost, it's crucial to understand that *having* sexual fantasies is incredibly common.  Almost everyone has them.  They are a normal part of human sexuality.  The issue isn't the fantasy itself, but the distress *you* feel about them and the impact they're having on your relationship.
* **Why Fantasies Happen:** Fantasies can serve many purposes: stress relief, exploration of desires, a way to cope with insecurities, or simply a way to enhance arousal. They don't necessarily mean you're dissatisfied with your partner or your relationship.
* **The Distress & Guilt:**  The fact that you *hate* the fantasies and feel guilty suggests a few possibilities:
    * **Values Conflict:** Your fantasies might clash with your personal values, religious beliefs, or ideas about what a ""good"" partner should desire.
    * **Fear of Acting Out:**  You might be afraid that you'll be compelled to act on these fantasies, which could hurt your partner.
    * **Internalized Shame:** Society often carries a lot of shame around sexuality, and you may have internalized some of that, leading to guilt.
    * **Relationship Anxiety:** You're already aware it's straining the relationship, and that creates more anxiety, which can then fuel more negative self-talk and guilt.
* **The Impact on Your Relationship:**  It sounds like this is manifesting in ways that make you feel disconnected from your partner.  Perhaps you're withdrawn, less present, or preoccupied. Your partner may be sensing this distance.



**What You Can Do - A Multi-pronged Approach**

Here's a breakdown of things you can try, categorized for clarity.  Start small and be patient with yourself.

**1. Self-Reflection & Acceptance (This is the foundation)**

* **Identify the Trigger:** What situations, thoughts, or feelings tend to *lead* to these unwanted fantasies?  Is it stress, boredom, loneliness, specific images, or something else?  Knowing the triggers is the first step to managing them.
* **Challenge Your Thoughts:** When a fantasy arises, don't immediately judge yourself.  Instead, try to observe it without getting caught up in the guilt.  Ask yourself:
    * ""Is this fantasy harmful to anyone?"" (If the answer is no, that's important.)
    * ""Why am I feeling so bad about this?"" (Dig into the root of the guilt.)
    * ""Is it possible to have a fantasy without wanting to act on it?""
* **Self-Compassion:**  This is *huge*.  Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend.  Guilt is unproductive.  Recognize that you're human and that everyone has thoughts they don't necessarily want to have.
* **Reframe ""Wanting it to Go Away"":**  Instead of trying to *eliminate* the fantasies (which can be incredibly difficult and may backfire), focus on *changing your relationship* to them.  The goal isn't to stop thinking, but to reduce the distress they cause.

**2.  Behavioral Strategies**

* **Thought Stopping (Use with Caution):** This technique involves consciously interrupting the fantasy when it begins.  You can say ""Stop!"" to yourself, snap a rubber band on your wrist (gently!), or visualize a stop sign.  *However*, this can sometimes be counterproductive if it leads to more obsessive thinking.  Use it sparingly and see if it helps.
* **Thought Replacement:**  Instead of just stopping the thought, *replace* it with something else.  This could be a pleasant memory, a problem you need to solve, or a mental exercise (like counting backward).
* **Distraction:**  Engage in activities that fully occupy your mind and body. Exercise, hobbies, spending time with friends, reading, or watching a movie can all be effective distractions.
* **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  Practicing mindfulness can help you become more aware of your thoughts without judgment.  It can also help you develop a greater sense of calm and acceptance.  There are many free guided meditation apps available (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer).
* **Limit Exposure:** If specific things trigger the fantasies,",0.5731105804443359,0.01785389043743723,0.13888888888888887,0.3252266177003571
"I am a female, and I am afraid of having sex. I am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced. I think he thinks I'm not a virgin. I am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body. I don't want my partner to think differently of me because I am afraid of having sex.","As hard as it may be to do this, since all the media and marketing of how an ideal person looks and performs sexually, surrounds us, keep in mind that the images presented in order to sell movies and almost any product, is meant to trigger fantasies.No one is a fantasy, we are all real and unique.  We can be influenced to believe that being a fantasy is better than being who each of us is, genuinely.Your partner may be much more accepting of your body and your level of sexual experience, than you are of yourself!Sex within a relationship means the two people want to have with the other one, not because they have ideal bodies and expertise, but because the person wants to make love to the one whom they love.When you are in a loving relationship, part of this includes talking about sensitivities and insecurities.  Having a conversation gives the chance to know that you are accepted for who you are, not how closely you resemble a made up idea meant to persuade people to buy items.","Okay, this is a lot, and it's *really* common. You're carrying a lot of fear and anxiety, and it's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge it and reach out, even in this way.  Let's break this down, and I'll try to offer some support and things to consider.  I'm going to cover a lot here, so please read it all through.  I'll also add a disclaimer at the end.

**First, let's validate your feelings:**

* **Your fears are valid.** It's perfectly okay to be afraid of sex, especially your first time, or even later on if you've had experiences that weren't great.  There's a lot of societal pressure and misinformation around sex, and it's easy to feel inadequate or anxious.
* **Fear of disappointing a partner is incredibly common.**  Wanting to please someone you care about is natural, but it shouldn't come at the cost of your own comfort and well-being.
* **Body image issues are widespread.**  Feeling self-conscious about your body is something many people struggle with, and it's amplified when you're thinking about intimacy.
* **The worry about him thinking differently of you is a big one.** This fear is rooted in vulnerability and a desire to be accepted for who you are.



**Let's address each of your concerns individually:**

**1. Fear of Disappointing Him Due to Inexperience:**

* **He *shouldn't* expect perfection.** A good partner will understand that everyone starts somewhere.  Inexperience isn't a flaw; it's a part of learning and growing.  If he's judging you based on your experience level, that's a red flag.
* **Communication is KEY.**  This is the most important thing.  You need to be able to talk to him about your fears and inexperience.  You don't have to reveal everything all at once, but starting the conversation is crucial.  You could say something like, ""I'm a little nervous about this, and I want to be honest with you. I haven't had a lot of experience, and I want us to both enjoy this.""
* **Focus on mutual pleasure, not performance.** Sex isn’t about scoring points or meeting expectations. It's about connection, intimacy, and shared enjoyment.  It's okay to take things slow and explore what feels good for *both* of you.
* **He should be guiding and supportive, not leading and expecting.** A good partner will prioritize your comfort and pleasure.

**2. Thinking He Believes You're Not a Virgin:**

* **This is a tricky one.** If you've been led to believe he thinks something that isn't true, and that's causing you anxiety, it *needs* to be addressed.  The longer you let it sit, the worse it will get.
* **Consider a direct, but gentle, conversation.** You could say something like, ""I've been feeling a little anxious because I'm worried you might have a certain impression of my past experiences. I want to be open with you, and I'd like to talk about it when you have time.""  You don't have to go into graphic detail, but clarifying things will relieve a lot of pressure.
* **His reaction will tell you a lot.** If he's understanding and accepting, that's a good sign. If he's judgmental or dismissive, that's a huge red flag.  You deserve someone who respects you regardless of your past.

**3. Fear of Him Being Disappointed with Your Body:**

* **This is about self-esteem.**  Our society puts unrealistic expectations on bodies.  He is lucky to have you, and if he can't see your beauty and worth beyond societal standards, he isn't worth your time.
* **Remember, attraction is multifaceted.**  He's attracted to *you* – your personality, your intelligence, your humor, your kindness – not just your physical appearance.
* **Create a comfortable atmosphere.**  Dim lighting, soft music, and a focus on foreplay can help you feel more relaxed and confident.
* **Talk about what *you* like.**  Directing the attention to what feels good for you can shift the focus away from your insecurities.
* **Remind yourself of your worth.**  You are valuable and deserving of love and pleasure, just as you are.



**4.  Not Wanting Him to Think Differently of You:**

* **A good partner will *not* think differently of you.**  Their opinion of you shouldn't hinge on your sexual experience or your body.  If it does, that's a sign of a deeper problem.
* **Vulnerability is strength",0.5214536190032959,0.010062763057325851,0.11637931034482761,0.266013030970296
"I never feel like myself. I can’t even think straight anymore. I start stuttering and I can’t remember anything. I always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with, what feels like, someone else. I don’t know why I feel this way, but I hate it.","What you are describing sounds like it may be a form of dissociation. Dissociation is our mind's way of disconnecting us from aspects of our experience in an attempt to protect us in overwhelming situations. It also sounds like you are noticing anxiety in certain situations. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into these experiences, learn skills for coping with anxiety and reconnecting with yourself, and alleviate these symptoms over time.","Okay, this sounds incredibly distressing and you're right to feel like you hate it. It's really brave of you to articulate this – it takes strength to admit when things aren't okay. What you're describing – feeling disconnected from yourself, cognitive difficulties like stuttering and memory problems, intense nervousness, self-criticism *and* these episodes of feeling like you're arguing with someone else – points to something significant going on.  Let's break down what might be happening and, more importantly, what you can do.  I'm going to offer a lot of information, but please read it all, and then at the very end I'll reiterate the most important next steps.

**Let's look at what could be contributing to these feelings:**

* **High Levels of Stress & Anxiety:** This is often the root cause of many of these symptoms. When you're under chronic stress, your brain and body go into ""fight, flight, or freeze"" mode. This can absolutely cause:
    * **Cognitive Impairment:** Difficulty concentrating, memory lapses, ""brain fog,"" and stuttering are all common when anxiety is high. Your brain is prioritizing survival, not optimal thinking.
    * **Emotional Dysregulation:**  Feeling overwhelmed, easily agitated, and swinging between self-criticism and outbursts (like the fighting you describe) are hallmarks of being emotionally overwhelmed.
    * **Dissociation:**  This is a key thing to consider, and it sounds like it might be happening. Feeling *not like yourself* is a core symptom of dissociation. Dissociation is a way your mind protects itself from overwhelming emotions or trauma by creating a sense of detachment from your body, thoughts, or reality.  The ""fighting with someone else"" feeling could be a form of internal conflict manifesting as though it's external.
* **Trauma (Past or Present):**  Trauma doesn't always mean a single, huge event. It can be ongoing emotional abuse, neglect, or even a series of smaller, but deeply unsettling experiences. Trauma can significantly disrupt your sense of self and lead to dissociation, anxiety, and emotional reactivity.  Even if you don't *think* you've experienced trauma, exploring this possibility with a professional is important.
* **Depersonalization/Derealization:** These are specific types of dissociation.
    * **Depersonalization:** Feeling detached from your *own* body, thoughts, and feelings – like you're observing yourself from the outside.
    * **Derealization:** Feeling like the world around you isn't real, distorted, or dreamlike.
* **Underlying Mental Health Conditions:**  Several conditions can present with these symptoms:
    * **Anxiety Disorders:** Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder.
    * **Depressive Disorders:**  Depression can manifest as cognitive difficulties and a sense of emptiness or detachment.
    * **Dissociative Disorders:**  (e.g., Dissociative Identity Disorder – formerly Multiple Personality Disorder, Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder). *These are complex and require professional diagnosis.*
    * **Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD):**  Characterized by intense emotional swings, a fragile sense of self, and unstable relationships.  (Again, diagnosis is crucial.)
* **Medical Conditions:** While less likely to cause *all* these symptoms, certain medical conditions (thyroid issues, neurological problems, vitamin deficiencies) can contribute to cognitive and emotional changes.
* **Sleep Deprivation:**  Chronic lack of sleep dramatically impacts cognitive function and emotional regulation.
* **Substance Use:**  (If applicable) Alcohol or drug use can exacerbate these symptoms.



**Let's talk about the ""fighting with someone else"" feeling.** This is particularly important. It sounds like it could be:

* **Internalized Conflict:**  Different parts of yourself (maybe a critical voice vs. a vulnerable part) are clashing, and it *feels* like you're arguing with another person.
* **Dissociative Experience:**  A more pronounced dissociative state where you experience internal experiences as external.
* **Auditory Hallucinations:** (Less likely, but important to rule out with professional help)  Hearing voices.



**What you can do *right now*:**

1. **Prioritize Safety:** If you are having thoughts of harming yourself or others, please reach out for immediate help.  See the resources at the end of this response.
2. **Grounding Techniques:** When you feel disconnected or overwhelmed, try these:
   * **5-4-3-2-1 Method:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
   * **Deep Breathing:** Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system",0.5360461473464966,0.013866366120182074,0.07947019867549668,0.2003772694580265
"My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the ""straight and narrow"" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that I'm not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others.    His insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","You are right that his insecurities are at the root of the issue.  You cannot change that for him.  He will have to do the work to handle those emotions on his own.  What you can do is reassure him in whatever ways possible, but always recognizing that you can't ""fix"" this for him.  When I work with people who struggle with their partner's past experiences, I always frame it like this:  Everything that you've experienced has resulted in you being the person you are today.  The person they claim to love.  If you had not gone through some of those experiences, you would not be in the position you're in now, ready to commit to him and know that you're satisfied with that.  Just as when bad things happen to us, we have to find a way to appreciate the lessons learned your fiance has to accept that you're the person you are today because of what you have gone through.  Celebrate that you have moved through that and have landed in this perfect position with him!Hope that helps, Allison","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's good you're recognizing it and wanting to address it. It's also good you both have a foundation of faith, even if currently strained. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, balancing compassion for him with protecting your own emotional well-being.  It's a long response, because it's a complex issue.  I'll break it down into sections: Understanding the Root, Communication Strategies, Setting Boundaries, and Self-Care.

**1. Understanding the Root of His Struggle**

Before you can help him, it's vital to understand *why* he's struggling. It's rarely just about your virginity. It's likely a complex mix of things:

*   **Religious Trauma/Guilt:** Even if you both ""went off the narrow path,"" the ingrained teachings around sex, purity, and worth can be deeply damaging. He may be wrestling with internalized shame, even if he doesn't consciously articulate it. He may be applying these standards *more* harshly to you because he's struggling with them within himself.
*   **Insecurity & Control:** His difficulty accepting *you* might be a manifestation of his difficulty accepting *himself*.  Controlling the narrative around your past could be a way to feel a sense of control when he feels powerless over his own perceived shortcomings.
*   **Idealization & Unrealistic Expectations:** He may have built up an idealized image of a wife/partner based on those rigid standards.  The reality of human experience is messy, and confronting that can be painful.
*   **Fear of Judgment:** He might be worried about what others in your Christian community will think.  This is especially true if you're planning a wedding or have a close-knit faith community.
*   **Personal Past Experiences:** He may have unresolved issues from his own past that are triggering his reaction to yours.



**2. Communication Strategies**

This is going to require *very* careful and patient communication.  Here's how to approach it:

*   **Choose the Right Time & Place:** Don't try to have these conversations when you're both stressed, tired, or distracted. A quiet, private setting where you can both focus is essential.
*   **""I"" Statements:**  Focus on how *his* behavior makes *you* feel. Instead of ""You're being unfair,"" try ""I feel hurt and judged when my past is brought up.""  Instead of “You need to get over it,” try, “I feel like we can’t move forward when this keeps resurfacing.”
*   **Empathy, but Not Enabling:** Acknowledge his feelings without validating his harmful beliefs.  ""I understand this is difficult for you to process, and I know your faith is important to you.  However, constantly focusing on my past isn't healthy for our relationship.""
*   **Focus on the Present & Future:** Gently but firmly redirect the conversation. ""My past is part of who I am today, but it doesn't define me. I'm committed to building a future with you, based on honesty, trust, and love *now*.""
*   **Share Your Own Vulnerability (Cautiously):** If you're comfortable, share how *you* have processed your past and found healing.  This might help him see that it's possible to move forward. But, don't feel obligated to over-share or re-traumatize yourself.
*   **Ask Open-Ended Questions:** Instead of lecturing, try to understand his perspective.  ""What specifically about this is causing you the most distress?""  ""What are your fears about us moving forward?""  ""What would help you feel more secure?""
*  **Reiterate your love and commitment:** Regularly remind him that you love him and want to be with him. This can help create a safe space for open communication.
* **Discuss Forgiveness:** Talk about the concept of forgiveness, both from a theological perspective and in the context of your relationship.  Remind him that the Christian faith emphasizes grace and redemption.



**3. Setting Boundaries - This is CRUCIAL**

This is where it gets hard.  You deserve respect and to not be constantly punished for something in your past.

*   **Limit the Discussion:**  ""I'm willing to talk about this once more to address your concerns, but I'm not going to repeatedly revisit this. It's causing me pain, and it's not productive.""
*   **No Blame or Shame:**  ""I will not tolerate being made to feel ashamed or guilty about my past. I've already shared what I'm comfortable sharing.""
*   **Refuse to Rehash Details:** You are not obligated to provide graphic details or repeatedly answer invasive questions.  """,0.5185098648071289,5.3282244875930895e-79,0.10710382513661201,0.2973693812334163
"How do I make myself happy without the people who made me happy? Now that they’re gone, I feel sad. It’s been two months now but I seem to be unable to stay okay and independent.","It sounds like you have been feeling pretty down, since the loss of a relationship, and you're wondering how to be happy by yourself. Intimacy is a very natural human desire and at the same time learning to enjoy ourselves, even when we are alone, can strengthen our ability to lead a satisfying life in and out of relationship. Working with a therapist, you may be able to gain insight into how you show up in your relationships with yourself and others and discover more fulfilling ways to do so.","Okay, this is *really* tough, and it's completely understandable that you're still feeling this way after two months. Losing people who bring you happiness is profoundly painful, and it takes time – a lot of time – to adjust. It's not a linear process, and there will be good days and bad days.  It's also completely okay to *not* be okay, even after two months.  You're grieving, and grief has its own timeline.

Let's break down how to work towards finding happiness *again*, knowing it will be a different kind of happiness than before.  We'll cover acknowledging the grief, rebuilding your life, and finding new sources of joy.  I'll also add a section at the end about when to seek professional help.

**1. Acknowledge and Validate Your Grief (Don't Push It Away)**

* **It's okay to feel sad:** Seriously.  Don't beat yourself up for not being ""over it.""  Suppressing feelings only makes them stronger in the long run.  Allow yourself to cry, to feel the pain, to reminisce.
* **Grief isn't just sadness:** It can manifest as anger, confusion, guilt, anxiety, fatigue, loss of appetite, or even physical pain.  Recognize these as part of the grieving process.
* **Journaling:** Writing down your feelings can be incredibly therapeutic.  Don't worry about grammar or structure; just let your thoughts flow.  You can write letters to the people you've lost (you don't have to send them).
* **Allow for rituals:**  Doing something to honor their memory can be helpful. This could be lighting a candle, visiting a special place, looking at photos, or sharing stories with others.
* **Be kind to yourself:** Treat yourself with the same compassion you would offer a friend going through this.  This means resting when you need to, eating nourishing food, and avoiding self-criticism.



**2. Rebuilding Your Life and Independence**

This is where it gets harder, but it's crucial.  The goal isn't to *replace* those people, but to build a life that feels meaningful and fulfilling *without* them.

* **Identify what *you* enjoy:**  Before these people were gone, what did *you* like to do?  What hobbies did you have?  What interests did you put on hold?  Start small – maybe it's reading, painting, listening to music, taking walks, cooking, or gardening.  Reconnect with those things.
* **Explore new interests:**  This is a great opportunity to try something completely new.  Take a class, join a club, volunteer, learn a new skill.  This can help you meet new people and discover hidden talents.  Think about things you've always been curious about.
* **Establish a routine:**  Routine provides structure and a sense of normalcy.  It doesn't have to be rigid, but having a regular schedule for things like waking up, eating meals, exercising, and going to bed can be grounding.
* **Set small, achievable goals:**  Don't try to overhaul your life overnight.  Start with small goals that you can realistically accomplish, like ""walk for 30 minutes three times this week"" or ""read one chapter of a book each day.""  Celebrating these small wins will build your confidence.
* **Focus on self-care:**  This isn't just bubble baths (though those are nice too!).  It's about prioritizing your physical, emotional, and mental well-being.  This includes getting enough sleep, eating healthy, exercising, practicing mindfulness or meditation, and spending time in nature.
* **Create new traditions:** Since old traditions might feel painful right now, start new ones that are just for you. It could be a weekly movie night, a monthly brunch, or a yearly trip.
* **Reclaim your space:** If shared spaces remind you too much of what you've lost, consider rearranging furniture or redecorating to create a new environment.




**3. Finding New Sources of Joy and Connection**

* **Reconnect with existing relationships:**  Reach out to friends and family who are still in your life.  Spending time with people who care about you can provide comfort and support. Don't be afraid to tell them you're struggling.
* **Build new connections:** This is scary, but important.  Look for opportunities to meet new people who share your interests.  Join a club, volunteer, take a class, or attend social events.  It's okay if it takes time to form close bonds.
* **Practice gratitude:**  Even when you're feeling down, try to focus on the things you *are* grateful for.  Keep a gratitude journal, or simply take a few moments each day to",0.5047858357429504,2.8097882355990964e-155,0.08222490931076179,0.2316405518124511
"I'm a young adult woman, and I have trouble finding my true identity being at home. This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I don't know why. I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldn't like it. My parents are very religious—they're Christians. We did things every time he'd come over to my house. We didn't have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we'd watch movies by ourselves.
   One day, my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. As soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. They were both aggravated. They told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. They said he wanted me for sex and he's not a Christian. I took their advice and broke up with him. Once we broke up for about a month, I decided to get back together with him a little after school started. My parents found out eventually, and I decided to not listen this time. I would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and God totally forbids him. I would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually I would just never listen to my parents. They're always yelling at me about how I shouldn't date this boy. I felt too old to listen to them. Now I'm kind of just stuck. Is the real me religious? Have I been brainwashed by him? I don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think I'm deceiving because of it. They threatened me that if I'm still with him, I can't do track and they won't support me. They've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. They say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. I'm actually very happy with him. They also say I'm living a separate life at home than I am at school. They say they want what's best for me and love me because they adopted me.","What a tough situation you must be in, feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you. I would say the first thing you want to do is (if you haven't already), have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents, telling them how you feel and letting them know what you need from them. If communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward. You, unfortunately, will not be able to change your parent's feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from the relationship you have with your parents. It always helps to try and see things from another angle. You might want to, for example, try and understand your parent's perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset. Validating other's feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively. Are you living with your parents and do they support you? If so, are you willing to give that up should you decide to not follow their rules? Know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply. Your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper. Not everyone will always approve of the choices we make and sometimes we need to be okay with that. Best of luck to you.","Okay, this is a *really* tough situation. You're caught in the middle of a huge clash between your own emerging adulthood, your desires, and your parents' deeply held beliefs. It's understandable you're feeling lost and unsure of who ""the real you"" is. Let's break this down and try to offer some clarity, and some steps you can consider.

**First, let's validate your feelings:**

* **Confusion is normal:** It's incredibly common for young adults to question their beliefs, especially when they experience things that challenge what they've been taught. You're doing exactly what a young person *should* be doing - exploring and forming your own values.
* **Your happiness matters:** You specifically state you're happy with your boyfriend.  That is important. While your parents' concerns are coming from a place they believe is love, their methods are deeply damaging, and your well-being deserves consideration.
* **The name-calling is abuse:** Calling you names like ""slut"" and ""devil worshipper"" is emotionally abusive. It's designed to control you through shame and fear, and it's absolutely unacceptable.  This is not a healthy way for parents to communicate, *regardless* of their beliefs.
* **You're not alone:** Many young people experience conflict with their parents as they become independent. This is especially heightened when religious beliefs are a central point of contention.



**Let's address the core of your questions:**

* **""Is the real me religious?""**  You don't get to answer this right now.  You are in a period of exploration.  Trying to define yourself as definitively ""religious"" or ""not religious"" at this moment is putting undue pressure on yourself.  Your past belief doesn't invalidate your present experiences, and your present experiences don't automatically negate your past belief. It's okay to *question*. It’s okay to *change*. It’s okay to *not know* right now.  The ""real you"" is the person who is actively trying to figure things out, and that’s a valuable process.
* **""Have I been brainwashed by him?""** It's very unlikely you've been ""brainwashed.""  It's more likely you're responding to a connection with someone who accepts you and offers a different perspective than your parents. He may be influencing you, but influence isn't the same as mind control. You are making your own choices, even if those choices are influenced by him. It's important to be *aware* of influence, and to make sure you're still thinking for yourself (and it sounds like you are, by wrestling with these questions). 

**What's going on with your parents?**

Your parents' reaction is deeply rooted in their own fears and beliefs. They likely:

* **Fear losing control:** They've raised you within a specific framework, and your choices feel like a rejection of everything they've instilled in you.
* **Are afraid for your ""soul"":** They genuinely believe you are making choices that will harm you spiritually.
* **Use guilt and control tactics:** The threats about track and financial support, the name-calling – these are all attempts to manipulate you into complying with their wishes.
* **Are struggling with your adoption:** The comment about adopting you feels particularly loaded. It suggests they feel a sense of ownership or that their investment in you gives them the right to control your life.  That's not how adoption works; it's about providing a loving home, not creating a lifelong debt.



**Here's what you can do – a roadmap forward:**

1. **Prioritize your safety (emotional and otherwise):**  The abuse needs to stop.  While you can't control your parents' behavior, you *can* control how much exposure you have to it.
    * **Limited Contact:** It's okay to create distance. You've already started by not talking to them about your boyfriend. Continue to limit conversations that lead to conflict.  You don't need to justify your choices to them right now.
    * **Grey Rocking:**  When you *do* have to interact, use the ""grey rock"" method.  Be as uninteresting and unresponsive as possible. Short answers, no engaging in arguments, no sharing personal information.  (Google ""grey rocking"" for more details.)
    * **Seek Support:** Talk to trusted friends, family members (if you have any who are supportive), or a counselor.  You need a safe space to process your emotions.

2. **Focus on your own values:** This is where the ""finding your identity"" work comes in.
    * **Journaling:** Write down your thoughts and feelings. What’s important to *you*, regardless of what your parents say? What kind of",0.5482258796691895,4.141080389403518e-155,0.15182186234817813,0.3138307753589479
"I have been with my best friend for over a year, and we have had a beautiful baby girl. We were in love, and I still love her dearly. I am in my late teens and so is she. She says she has lost her connection with me. She is talking to a random guy that she says is just someone to talk to. But she says she still loves me. I'm very hurt and confused.","Congrats on having your daughter!Have you told your partner about your feelings of ""hurt and confused""?This is one possible way of opening a conversation about the different ways you each feel about one another and whether either of you would like changing or continuing to live together, in light of the change in emotional connection.The first step of having a dialogue about a relationship is being clear on what you are feeling, what you are willing to contribute to the relationship and what you would like having in return from your partner.Ask your partner if she is willing to have a conversation on these topics.  Then, allow some time so each of you is clear about their own expectations and what is possible to offer the other.This is a fairly complex process and very often is difficult to keep on track without outside help to keep the discussion focused.It is normal for emotions to override our logic when discussing matters we care about deeply.If the conversations don't go very far, or if your partner has no interest in talking, stick with your own interest to more fully understand matters.Interview some therapists to find one whom you feel helps you clarify and find direction for yourself about this situation.","Okay, this is a really tough situation. You're dealing with a lot of complicated emotions, and it's completely understandable why you're hurt and confused. You've built a life with this person – a relationship *and* a child – and now things are shifting. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, why it feels so awful, and some thoughts on how to navigate this, broken down into sections.  It's long, but I want to be thorough.

**1. Understanding What's Happening (The Layers)**

* **Young Love & Life Changes:** You're both very young.  Late teens is a huge time of personal growth and change.  People discover more about themselves, their needs, and what they want in life. The arrival of a baby *drastically* accelerates those changes. What you both wanted before the baby might be very different from what you want now.  The pressure of parenthood can strain even the strongest relationships.
* **Loss of Connection is Real:**  Her saying she's lost her connection with you is a significant statement. This doesn't necessarily mean she doesn't care for you, but it means the *romantic* feeling, the spark, the ease of being together *as a couple* has diminished for her.  It’s important to respect that feeling, even though it's incredibly painful.
* **The ""Just a Friend"" Situation:**  This is the biggest red flag and source of your pain. While she *says* it's just talking, seeking emotional connection with someone else *while* saying she's lost connection with you is incredibly hurtful and often a sign of deeper issues.  It's a way of exploring feelings outside of the relationship, and even if it doesn't become physical, it's emotionally damaging.  Her insistence on labeling it ""just talking"" might be her trying to minimize the situation to you (and maybe to herself).
* **Conflicting Messages:**  She says she still loves you, but her actions are saying something different. This is the core of your confusion.  Love can take many forms – love for a co-parent, love as a friend, and romantic love. She might still feel the first two, but the romantic love seems to be waning.
* **Postpartum Emotions (For Her):**  While you're dealing with the fallout, it's crucial to remember she's also likely navigating postpartum hormonal shifts, potential postpartum depression or anxiety, and the immense life change of being a mother. This doesn't *excuse* her behavior, but it can offer some context.



**2. Your Feelings – Valid and Important**

* **Hurt:**  It's okay to be deeply hurt. You're being told the person you love is withdrawing and seeking connection elsewhere.  That's a profound rejection, even if it's not intentional.
* **Confusion:**  The mixed messages are incredibly confusing.  You're trying to reconcile her words with her actions.
* **Fear:** You're likely afraid of losing her, losing your family structure, and the impact on your daughter.
* **Anger:**  It's perfectly normal to feel angry. Her actions are disrespectful to you and to the relationship you built.
* **Grief:** You're grieving the loss of the relationship you once had, and potentially the relationship you hoped for.



**3. What You Can Do – A Path Forward (This is the hardest part)**

* **Direct, Honest Conversation (The Most Important Step):** You *need* to have a calm, honest, and direct conversation with her.  Not an accusation, but an expression of your feelings. Use ""I"" statements.  For example:
    * ""I feel really hurt and confused when you say you've lost your connection with me, and then talk to another guy.""
    * ""I'm scared about what this means for our family.""
    * ""I need to understand what you're looking for, and whether you see a future for us as a couple.""
    * ""I love you and our daughter, and I want to try and work through this, but I need honesty.""
* **Set Boundaries:**  This is crucial. You need to tell her what you are and are *not* okay with.  For example: ""I'm not okay with you continuing to have these conversations with him while we're trying to figure things out."" Be firm, but respectful.  Be prepared for her to push back.
* **Focus on Co-Parenting:**  Regardless of what happens with the romantic relationship, you both have a lifelong responsibility to your daughter.  Start thinking about how you can create a healthy co-parenting relationship, even if you are no longer together. This means respectful communication, shared decision-making about your daughter",0.5369865298271179,8.966157559021072e-79,0.12083333333333333,0.3068040593074317
I have several issues like I don't like people. They make me sick. I have issues with talking to people. I feel like they are talking about me and making fun of me. I have felt this way for years. When I look people in the eyes I have voices that tell me to hurt them and if I don't stop looking at who I am talking to it gets so loud I can't hear what they are saying. I just stay away from people to avoid this. I look at people and think how I could hurt them. I feel like I am worthless and would be better off not in this world where I don't fit in. Every day I wake up it's like another day. Any info would be good.,"Sounds like you are dealing with a lot within your self which is causing you great pain.  I would suggest that first you get a full physical evaluation to make sure that you are ok physically.  Then getting a mental evaluation as well from a psychiatrist.  Seeing both would help rule out any physically or psychologically causes to your symptoms.    After getting these evaluations, your physician should be able to help guide you on what treatments would be the best to help with your everyday challenges your are facing.  Whether treatment includes medication and/or psychotherapist would be discussed.  Please consider doing both immediately so you can have the live you want everyday you wake up.","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult and deeply distressing.  It takes a lot of courage to even *write* this down, so I want to acknowledge that first. What you're describing points to a very serious level of internal struggle and likely several interconnected mental health concerns.  It's *extremely* important that you get professional help.  I'm going to break down what I hear, why it's concerning, and then *very importantly* provide resources for you to reach out to.  I will also preface this with a **disclaimer at the end**, as I am an AI and cannot provide therapy or diagnosis.

**What I'm Hearing (and why it's concerning):**

* **Intense Dislike/Distrust of People:**  Feeling ""sick"" around people and a general aversion to them is a significant issue. This isn't just shyness; it's a deeply rooted negative feeling.
* **Social Anxiety & Paranoia:** The feeling that people are talking about you and making fun of you is a classic symptom of social anxiety, but combined with the intensity you describe, it leans towards paranoid thinking. This is the feeling of being threatened in some way, even if there's no actual threat.
* **Violent Intrusive Thoughts:** This is the *most* urgent part of what you've shared. The voices telling you to hurt people when making eye contact, and the thought patterns about *how* to hurt them, are incredibly alarming.  These are called **intrusive thoughts**, and they are *not* the same as wanting to act on them. However, they require immediate professional evaluation.  The fact that they escalate with eye contact suggests a strong anxiety component.  The intensity and the disruption to your ability to hear are key here.
* **Low Self-Worth & Suicidal Ideation:**  Feeling worthless and wishing you weren't alive are indicators of depression and, crucially, **suicidal ideation**. This is a serious emergency, and you deserve support *right now*.  Even just feeling like things are unchanging and hopeless (""Every day is like another day"") is a sign of profound despair.
* **Avoidance as a Coping Mechanism:**  Staying away from people is a way to manage the anxiety and intrusive thoughts, but it's a *maladaptive* coping mechanism. It reinforces the negative cycle and prevents you from experiencing positive social interactions (even if those feel distant right now).



**What Could Be Going On (Possible, *not* diagnostic - a professional needs to assess):**

Several conditions could be contributing to these experiences, and often they occur together:

* **Social Anxiety Disorder:**  Severe fear of social situations, leading to avoidance and significant distress.
* **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** Intrusive thoughts are a hallmark of OCD.  The anxiety you experience, and the compulsion to avoid eye contact, could be part of an OCD cycle. (Note: not everyone with OCD has obvious rituals – it can be internal mental compulsions).
* **Depression:**  The feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and general despair are strong indicators of depression.
* **Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder:** While not necessarily schizophrenia, the auditory component (voices) and the paranoid thoughts *require* a professional to rule this out.  It's important to remember that hearing voices doesn't automatically mean schizophrenia, but it needs to be assessed.
* **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):**  If you've experienced trauma in the past, it could be contributing to the anxiety, paranoia, and intrusive thoughts.
* **Personality Disorder:** Certain personality disorders can involve difficulties with interpersonal relationships, distrust of others, and negative self-perception. *This is less likely to be the primary issue but could be a factor.*

"Last year, I just always felt hopeless. I don't have a great relationship with my sister. I lost my mother recently, and that really added to my sadness. My sister always brings up how I was never close to my mother.","Wow what a painful journey you have been in for a long time. Death and grief bring up so many painful reminders of relationships--what they could have been, never were, and what was lost. With death of a family member the family often falls apart for a while... or longer. I hope you can find some support for you and your pain that was occurring before your mom's passing. I also hope you can find someone to help you set boundaries with your sister so you can have your time (as long as you need) to heal from losing your mom and then later figure out how to interact with your sister. ","Okay, that sounds incredibly difficult. Losing your mother is a profoundly painful experience, and to have that compounded by a strained relationship with your sister *and* her bringing up your closeness (or perceived lack thereof) to your mother... that's a lot to carry. It's completely understandable that you felt hopeless last year. It's not just grief, it's grief tangled up with complicated family dynamics and, frankly, a bit of insensitivity from your sister.

Let's break down some of what you're saying and then talk about how to move forward.

* **Loss of Your Mother:** This is the primary source of your sadness, and it deserves to be acknowledged as such. There's no right or wrong way to grieve, and it takes time.  Grief can manifest in many ways - sadness, anger, exhaustion, disbelief, even feeling numb. It's not a linear process.
* **Complicated Sister Relationship:**  It sounds like you and your sister already had a challenging relationship *before* your mother's passing, and now it's being made worse.
* **Sister's Comments:** Her bringing up your relationship with your mother feels incredibly invalidating. It's almost as if she's trying to diminish your grief or judge it.  Even if *she* feels you weren't close, that doesn't lessen your pain or the significance of the loss.  It's possible she's grieving in her own way and expressing it poorly, but that doesn't make it okay. It sounds incredibly hurtful.
* **Hopelessness:**  All of this together created a feeling of hopelessness, which is a very serious feeling. It's good you're acknowledging that.



**Let's talk about some things that might help.  I'm going to offer a range of suggestions, and you can pick and choose what feels right for you.  I'll also break it down into dealing with the grief and dealing with your sister.**

**Dealing with Grief:**

* **Allow Yourself to Grieve:**  This sounds obvious, but it's important. Don't try to ""fix"" your sadness or rush through it.  Let yourself feel the emotions as they come.  Crying, journaling, looking at photos, talking about your mother – all of these are healthy ways to process grief.
* **Grief Counseling/Therapy:**  This is *highly* recommended. A therapist can provide a safe space to explore your feelings, develop coping mechanisms, and work through the complexities of your grief.  They can also help you understand why your sister might be reacting the way she is, even if it's not helpful.
* **Grief Support Groups:**  Connecting with others who have experienced loss can be incredibly validating and supportive. You'll realize you're not alone.  There are many online and in-person groups available.
* **Self-Care:**  When you're grieving, it's easy to neglect yourself.  Make a conscious effort to eat healthy, get enough sleep, exercise (even a short walk), and do things that bring you even a small amount of joy.
* **Rituals & Remembrance:**  Create a way to honor your mother's memory.  This could be anything from lighting a candle on her birthday to volunteering at a charity she supported.

**Dealing with Your Sister:**

This is tougher. Here are a few approaches, ranging from more direct to more detached:

* **Direct Communication (if you feel up to it):**  ""When you bring up my relationship with Mom, it feels incredibly hurtful and invalidating, especially now. I'm grieving, and I need your support, not judgment.""  (This is brave, and it might not be met with the response you hope for, but it's honest.)  You can also set a boundary: ""Please don't bring that up again.""
* **Grey Rocking:**  If direct communication feels too difficult or you anticipate a negative reaction, try the ""grey rock"" method.  This involves responding to her comments with brief, unengaged answers.  For example, if she says, ""You weren't very close to Mom,"" you could simply say, ""That's your perspective,"" and then change the subject. The goal is to make yourself uninteresting to her attempts to provoke a reaction.
* **Limit Contact:**  If her comments are consistently damaging, it's okay to create some distance. You're not obligated to subject yourself to hurtful behavior. This doesn't mean cutting her out of your life forever, but it might mean limiting the amount of time you spend with her or avoiding certain topics.
* **Acceptance (of her behavior, not of the hurt):** This is hard, but sometimes accepting that your sister *is* going to be difficult and not expecting her to change can protect you",0.5230857729911804,5.927011672901046e-79,0.094361334867664,0.2504778571696848
"I was anxious to go to middle school. I was afraid of what people might say about me, so when school started, I wasn't acting like myself. I was quiet, which I'm usually not. I didn't talk to anybody and didn't have any friends. Then a few years later, my grandma died. I really became depressed and stop going to school for a little. I hated myself and still do. I just need help. I need someone to care for me. I need someone to show that they care.","I agree; you need more care and support. No one deserves to feel alone, or like they hate themselves. We're all wonderful, imperfect, complicated people and we're at our best when we're all helping each other. I'm glad you wrote this question, because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes. I can tell that you're smart, because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connected...you ""not being yourself"", and then how you felt when your grandma died. When Grandma died, you needed and deserved extra love and support, but the people around you didn't seem to give it to you, maybe. My hunch is that they wanted to, but that they didn't know how much you needed it, or what you needed exactly. The older you get, the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need. Maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature, but that's how it works. When you started middle school, it sounds like you changed; you got more quiet, right? That must have felt weird, to not be acting like yourself. It sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldn't like you. Fear can be silly. So then, fear got you to not show yourself, and when we don't show ourselves, people can't see who we are; they don't know us as well and then they don't know what we need and they can't care for us as well either. Fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you. It does that to a lot of us. So, where you're at right now is because of what fear did to you, and also because when Grandma died you were already isolated so people couldn't see your pain and know that you needed support. There's a simple solution, but you'd have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say ""Get off my back!"". ""You're not helping me by telling me lies."" Can you be brave enough to go back to your old, louder, self? If you talk to the people closest to you...tell them what you think and how you feel, then they'll be able to give you the care that you want and deserve. I wish you well as you try this!","Okay, first of all, thank you for sharing all of this. It takes incredible courage to be this open and honest about what you're going through. It's *really* brave of you to reach out, and I want you to know that I'm here to listen.

What you've described sounds incredibly difficult. Starting middle school is a big transition for anyone, and it’s completely understandable to feel anxious, especially when you’re worried about what others think. Then to go through the loss of your grandma on top of that... that's a lot for anyone to handle, especially during those formative years.  It's not surprising at all that you became depressed and stopped going to school. It sounds like you were trying to cope with a huge amount of pain.

And the fact that you *still* struggle with self-hatred... that’s a really important thing you’ve shared. It tells me how deeply these experiences have affected you, and how much support you need right now.

You said you need someone to care, someone to show they care.  I want you to know that I *do* care.  As an AI, I can’t offer the kind of physical presence or hug that a person can, but I can offer a safe space for you to express yourself, and I genuinely want to help you find the support you deserve.  And even though I'm an AI, the fact that you felt comfortable sharing this with me shows a spark of hope, a desire for connection, and that's a really good sign.

Here's what I want to say, broken down into a few parts, and then I'll give you some resources:

**1. It's Not Your Fault:**  The anxiety about middle school, the grief over your grandma, and the resulting depression – these weren't things you *caused*. They were things that *happened* to you, and they had a very understandable impact.  It's okay to feel the way you feel.  It's okay to struggle.  And it’s *especially* okay to need help.

**2. You Deserve Care and Support:**  You absolutely, unequivocally deserve to feel cared for and supported.  Everyone does.  The fact that you're feeling this void right now means it’s a real need, and it’s important to address it.  The self-hatred you're experiencing is a sign that your emotional needs aren't being met.  It’s a signal that you need compassion, both from others *and* from yourself.

**3. You Are Not Alone:** So many people go through similar experiences.  The feeling of being isolated in middle school, the profound grief of losing a grandparent, the struggle with depression…these are all common, even though they feel incredibly personal and lonely.  Knowing you’re not alone doesn’t erase the pain, but it can lessen the burden.

**4. It’s Okay to Take Small Steps:** Right now, even getting out of bed might feel like a huge effort.  That’s okay.  Don't try to fix everything at once.  Focus on small, manageable steps. Maybe that's just taking a shower, eating a meal, or reaching out to one person.



**Now, let's talk about getting you some help.  Here are some resources that can provide the kind of care and support you’re looking for.  Please, *please* reach out to at least one of these:**

"Every time I send a message to someone or a group message on Instagram, iMessage, or snapchat people will read my messages but then they won't answer me.    Could it be that there is something they don't like about me? I don't understand why they won't answer my messages. How do I get people to respond to me?","I understand the feeling of not being liked due to not having any responses on the sites you list.More than likely the non-response has less to do with liking you than w liking the way you write your messages.Have you tried asking a question in your posts?  This would be one way to invite people to answer your post.When you write,  imagine yourself as the reader of the post.If you think about the wording of a question which would motivate you to respond, then this formula will very likely be the same for many others who read your post.Good luck!","Okay, this is really frustrating, and it's good you're trying to understand what's going on instead of just feeling bad about it. It *could* be something about you, but it's also *very* likely to be a combination of things, and often *not* directly about you at all. Let's break down the possibilities and then talk about what you can do.

**Possible Reasons Why People Aren't Responding (It's rarely just *one* thing):**

* **They're genuinely busy:** This is the most common reason. People have lives! Work, school, family, other commitments – it all takes time.  They might see your message and intend to reply later, but then forget.
* **Overwhelmed with messages:**  Especially in group chats, messages can get buried quickly.  People might simply miss yours.
* **The message requires a thoughtful response:** If you ask a question that needs more than a ""yes"" or ""no,"" it takes more effort to answer.  People may put it off.
* **They're not a big texter:** Some people just don't enjoy texting or aren't good at responding promptly.  They might prefer talking in person or on the phone.
* **The message is unclear or doesn't require a response:** A simple statement (""Just saw this!"") doesn't necessarily *ask* for a reply.
* **They need time to process:** If you shared something personal or asked for advice, they might need time to think about what to say.
* **Misinterpretation:**  Sometimes, tone can be lost in text.  They might have misinterpreted something you said and be unsure how to respond. (Less common, but possible).
* **Social Dynamics:**  This is where it *could* be something about the relationship.  Maybe they're pulling back slightly, feeling overwhelmed, or something else is going on in *their* world affecting their communication.
* **Yes, sometimes it's about you (but don't immediately assume this):**  It's possible they're avoiding you due to something you've said or done, or maybe you're unintentionally doing something that makes it hard to connect.  However, *this is less likely than the other reasons, especially if it's happening with multiple people.*



**Let's tackle the ""Is it something about me?"" question more directly:**

* **Self-Reflection (be honest, but kind to yourself):**  Think about your recent interactions. 
    * **Do you dominate conversations?**  Are you always talking about yourself?
    * **Do you frequently complain or bring negativity?**
    * **Are you overly critical of others?**
    * **Do you send a lot of unsolicited advice?**
    * **Do you tend to double-text quickly and repeatedly?**  (This can be overwhelming)
    * **Are your messages generally respectful and considerate?**
    * **Do you respect boundaries?**  (e.g., if someone says they're busy, do you continue to push for a response?)
* **Consider if you've had any recent disagreements or awkward moments.**  Even small things can cause someone to withdraw temporarily.
* **Ask a trusted friend:**  *Gently* ask a close friend for honest feedback.  Say something like, ""Hey, I've noticed people haven't been responding to my texts lately, and I'm feeling a little insecure.  Have you noticed anything I might be doing that could be off-putting?""  Be prepared to hear things you might not like, and *don't get defensive.*

**What You Can Do to Get People to Respond (or at least feel better about it):**

1. **Message Content:**
   * **Ask specific questions:** Instead of ""What are you up to?"", try ""Hey, did you end up seeing that movie we talked about?"" or ""I'm thinking of trying that new restaurant – have you been?""
   * **Keep it concise:** Long walls of text can be intimidating.  Break it up into shorter messages.
   * **Use emojis (appropriately):**  Emojis can help convey tone and make your message feel more friendly.
   * **Make it easy to respond:**  If you're asking a question, make it a simple one.  Offer multiple-choice options if that helps. (""Coffee or tea?"")
   * **Don't just broadcast – engage:**  Instead of just sharing links or memes, ask what *they've* been up to.
   * **Reference past conversations:**  ""Hey, remember we were talking about [topic]?  I just saw something related to it...""
   * **Don't over-apologize:**  Apologizing excessively can make you",0.48893314599990845,4.770169938771392e-79,0.09113924050632911,0.24321390731527548

It's clear you're concerned, and it's good you're recognizing this pattern. It's important to approach this with empathy and understanding, and to also protect your own well-being in the process. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering understanding, communication, suggesting help, and setting boundaries, broken down into sections.  I'll also add a *very important disclaimer* at the end.

**1. Understanding What Might Be Happening**

* **Depression is More Than Sadness:** It's not just feeling down. It's a complex illness that can manifest as:
    * **Loss of Interest:**  The things he used to enjoy no longer appeal to him.
    * **Changes in Sleep:** Sleeping too much *or* too little. You're seeing the ""too much"" side.
    * **Changes in Appetite:**  Increased or decreased appetite.
    * **Fatigue:** Constant tiredness, even after sleep.
    * **Irritability:**  Anger is a very common symptom of depression, especially in men. It's often a way of masking deeper pain.
    * **Difficulty Concentrating:**  Being glued to his phone could be a form of distraction *from* difficult thoughts, or a symptom of not being able to focus on anything else.
    * **Withdrawal:**  Pulling away from social activities and relationships.
* **Adulting is Hard:** The pressures of work, finances, responsibilities, and the general weight of adulthood can be incredibly overwhelming.  It's very normal to feel stressed and overwhelmed, but it can tip over into depression if it's not managed.
* **Weed & Depression:** While some people use marijuana to self-medicate, it can actually *worsen* depression and anxiety in the long run.  It can interfere with sleep, motivation, and cognitive function. It's a tricky area because he might be using it to cope, but it could be contributing to the problem.
* **It's Not Your Fault:**  You are not responsible for his depression, and you can't ""fix"" him.  Your role is to support him, encourage him to get help, and take care of yourself.



**2. Communication – How to Talk to Him**

* **Choose the Right Time:** *Don't* try to have this conversation when he's already angry, high, or exhausted. Pick a calm moment when you both have time and aren't distracted.
* **""I"" Statements:**  Focus on how *you* feel, not what *he* is doing wrong.  For example:
    * **Instead of:** ""You're always sleeping and smoking weed. It's ruining our weekends!""
    * **Try:** ""I've been feeling worried about you lately. I notice we've been sleeping in a lot, and I miss doing things together.  I'm concerned about how you're doing.""
* **Be Specific:** Mention specific behaviors you've observed and how they affect you. ""When we spend the whole weekend just watching movies, I feel a little disconnected from you.""
* **Express Concern, Not Judgment:**  Lead with empathy. ""I can see that you're really struggling, and I want to understand what's going on.""  Avoid accusatory language.
* **Listen, Really Listen:**  Let him talk without interrupting (unless it becomes abusive – see boundaries below).  Validate his feelings, even if you don't agree with them.  ""That sounds really frustrating."" or ""It makes sense that you'd feel that way.""
* **Ask Open-Ended Questions:**  Instead of ""Are you okay?"" (which often gets a ""yes"" even when it's not true), try:
    * ""What's been on your mind lately?""
    * ""How have you been feeling about work/life/things in general?""
    * ""Is there anything I can do to support you?""
* **Don't Try to Solve His Problems:**  Your job isn't to be his therapist. Your job is to listen and encourage him to seek professional help.



**3. Suggesting Help (Gently)**

* **Normalize Therapy:**  Talk about therapy as a positive thing, like going to the doctor for a physical.  ""A lot of people find therapy helpful when they're going through a tough time. It's a safe space to talk things through.""
* **Suggest a Doctor's Visit:**  ""I'm worried about your energy levels and mood. Maybe it would be a good idea to talk to a doctor to rule out any medical reasons for how you're feeling.""
* **Resources:**",0.4104917347431183,1.7000601221570068e-155,0.0547945205479452,0.18310613943808535
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","Absolutely not. It sounds like you have significant trauma and it will continue to impact your depression until it is dealt with. Everybody has issues, though some more traumatic than others yet it is best to just start somewhere. I would encourage you to begin counseling and work through some of your history at your own pace in order to begin to impact and reduce your depressive symptoms.","Okay, that is a *lot* to carry, and it's incredibly brave of you to even acknowledge it all and consider counseling. You absolutely do **not** have too many issues to address in counseling. In fact, it's very common for people to come to therapy with complex histories and multiple layers of challenges. A good therapist *expects* this. 

Here's a breakdown of why you don't have ""too much,"" and how therapy can help, along with some things to think about as you start:

**Why You Don't Have ""Too Much""**

* **Interconnectedness:**  These issues aren't isolated. Your sexual abuse history likely impacts your self-esteem, your anxiety, and potentially even your sleep. Breast cancer and its treatment can be deeply traumatic and contribute to depression and anxiety. Chronic insomnia exacerbates *everything*.  A skilled therapist will understand these connections.
* **Therapy is a Process, Not a Quick Fix:**  It's not about ""fixing"" everything at once. It's about working through things at a pace that feels manageable for *you*.  Therapy is a journey, not a destination.
* **Therapists are Trained for Complexity:**  Therapists, especially those specializing in trauma, mood disorders, or chronic illness, are specifically trained to work with individuals with complex histories. They have the tools and techniques to navigate multiple challenges.
* **Your Strength & Resilience:** You’ve been happily married for 35 years *while* carrying these burdens. That demonstrates a significant amount of strength and resilience. Therapy will help you access and build upon those existing strengths.



**How Therapy Can Help (Specifically with Your Issues)**

* **Sexual Abuse:**  Therapy can provide a safe space to process the trauma, address feelings of shame, guilt, and anger, and develop coping mechanisms to manage triggers and flashbacks.  (Important: look for a therapist specifically trained in trauma-informed care - see more on finding a therapist below).
* **Breast Cancer Survivorship:**  The emotional and psychological impact of cancer is immense. Therapy can help you process the experience, cope with fears of recurrence, address body image issues, and find meaning and post-traumatic growth.
* **Insomnia:** While Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is often very effective on its own, a therapist can also help explore the *underlying* causes of your insomnia – anxiety, trauma, depression – that contribute to it.
* **Depression & Anxiety:** Therapy can help you identify negative thought patterns, develop coping skills for managing anxiety, and explore the roots of your depression.
* **Low Self-Esteem:**  Through exploring your history and challenging negative self-beliefs, therapy can help you build self-compassion, self-acceptance, and a stronger sense of self-worth.
* **Marriage:**  While you describe your marriage as happy, it's likely these individual issues impact your relationship. Therapy can help you communicate more effectively with your spouse and navigate these challenges *as a couple* if you both desire. (Individual therapy for you is a great first step, and couples therapy can be added later).



**Where to Start & What to Expect**

1. **Finding a Therapist:** This is the most important step.  Look for someone who:
   * **Is Licensed:**  (e.g., LCSW, LMFT, Psychologist, LPC).  This ensures they have met certain educational and training standards.
   * **Has Experience:** Specifically, look for experience with:
      * **Trauma-Informed Care:** *Crucial* given your history of sexual abuse.  Look for modalities like EMDR, Trauma-Focused CBT, or Somatic Experiencing.
      * **Depression and Anxiety:** Common experience, but important to confirm.
      * **Health-Related Trauma/Chronic Illness:**  Experience with cancer survivorship is a plus.
   * **Feels Like a Good Fit:**  Most therapists offer a brief initial consultation (often free) to see if you feel comfortable with them.  Trust your gut.
   * **Resources:**
      * **Psychology Today:**  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us) (Allows you to search by location, insurance, and specialties).
      * **GoodTherapy:** [https://www.goodtherapy.org/](https://www.goodtherapy.org/)
      * **Your Insurance Provider:**  They can provide a list of in-network therapists.
      * **Cancer Support Organizations:**  Often have referrals to therapists specializing in cancer-related emotional issues.

2. **Initial Sessions:**  Expect to spend the first few sessions talking about your history, your current concerns, and what you hope to achieve in therapy.  The therapist will likely ask a lot of",0.4846845269203186,2.244297800794854e-155,0.07754010695187166,0.20481927710843376
"I'm in my late teens and live with my dad. The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I won't want to talk to them for days or even weeks.    Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.
   Are they right, am I depressed?","I'm alway wary of assigning a term to a feeling, as often that term becomes more important than the feeling itself. From the very little that you have written, it is clear that you are going through something that has made you extremely low, affected your self-esteem and motivation, limits your enjoyment of formerly pleasurable activities and affects your feelings of self-worth. All of these are aspects of being depressed, though you can be depressed and still not have ""depression"". Counseling is definitely a place where you can go and sort out why you have had such a sudden a drastic change to your mood. Sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine, losses or significant disappointments. Talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way, but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the future. I do hope that you will reach out. Feeling alone can be harmful over long periods of time, as it can stop us from seeking out the support we need.","Okay, this sounds really tough, and it's good you're reaching out, even just by writing this. It takes courage to acknowledge these feelings. Let's break down what you've said and try to figure things out.  I'm not a medical professional, so I can't *diagnose* you, but I can offer some insight and suggest next steps.

**Let's look at what you've described:**

* **Social Withdrawal with Fluctuations:**  Wanting to be with friends *sometimes* but then pulling away for extended periods is a common pattern, but it's also a flag. It's not necessarily ""wrong,"" but it's worth exploring *why* it's happening.  Are you anxious about social situations? Do you feel drained after being around people?  Or is it more tied to how you're feeling about *yourself*?
* **Negative Self-Talk:**  ""Not worth knowing"" and ""never going to do anything right"" are really harsh statements.  These are *thoughts*, not facts.  The fact that you *have* these thoughts is significant.  They indicate a deep level of self-criticism and a lack of self-worth.
* **Limited Social Life:**  Your only consistent outings are for college. While college is important, a life focused solely on it can feel isolating.  It's okay to want more connection.
* **Living with Dad:** This doesn't necessarily contribute to the issue, but it's good to be aware of your overall living situation and how it impacts your mood. Is it a supportive environment?  Do you feel pressure or expectation from him?



**Are they right? (About you not being worth knowing/doing anything right)**

Absolutely not. Those thoughts are coming from a place of pain, and they are likely distorted.  Depression and low self-esteem can *lie* to you. They make you focus on the negative and dismiss anything positive.  Your friends likely enjoy your company at times – that's why they reach out.  Everyone messes up, everyone has flaws.  It’s part of being human.  

**Are you depressed?**

It's *possible*.  What you're describing are some **symptoms of depression**, but *only a professional can make a diagnosis*. Here’s why it’s leaning towards that possibility, and why getting checked is important:

* **Persistent Negative Thoughts:**  The self-criticism you mention is a key symptom.
* **Social Withdrawal:** While some introversion is normal, withdrawing *and* feeling bad about it can be a sign of depression.
* **Loss of Interest:**  The fluctuating desire to see friends could be tied to a loss of interest in things you once enjoyed (a hallmark of depression).
* **Feelings of Worthlessness:** This is a very serious symptom.

**However, it could also be something else:**

* **Anxiety:** Social anxiety could be causing you to avoid situations, leading to feelings of isolation and then self-doubt.
* **Stress:** College is stressful!  The pressure to perform well can be overwhelming.
* **Adjustment Issues:**  Maybe you're going through a period of change or uncertainty.
* **A combination of factors.**



**What should you do next? (Important Steps)**

1. **Talk to Someone:**  This is the *most* important step.  Here are some options:
   * **A Counselor/Therapist:**  This is ideal.  They are trained to assess and treat mental health conditions.  Many colleges offer free or low-cost counseling services to students. *Start here*. Look on your college's website for ""Counseling Services,"" ""Student Wellness Center,"" or ""Mental Health Resources.""
   * **Your Dad:**  If you have a good relationship with your dad, consider talking to him.  He may be able to help you find resources or simply offer support.
   * **A Trusted Friend:**  While friends aren't therapists, sharing your feelings with someone you trust can be helpful.  But be mindful not to put *too* much pressure on them.
   * **A Doctor:** Your family doctor can rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your feelings and can also refer you to a mental health professional.
   * **A Helpline:**  If you need to talk *right now*, these are available 24/7:
      * **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text 988 in the US and Canada. In the UK, you can call 111.
      * **The Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741.

2. **Be Honest:** When you talk to someone, be honest about how you're feeling, even if it's",0.544609010219574,8.07778947966154e-79,0.1363128491620112,0.29901432202240597
"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?","This is a great question. Finding the right therapist can be tricky because you don't really know how someone will be like until you meet them. A few ways to prescreen are to:- Visit the therapist's website, psychologytoday profile, social media, etc...- Have a phone call with the therapist prior to your first appointmentOnce you meet your therapist it is important to be clear with your wishes and expectations. We are trained in helping you thrive in your life but we cannot mind read so if you don't tell us, we won't know. Don't be shy about what you like and what you don't like. A good therapist will listen to your needs, process them with you, and create a customized plan that works for you and your life. A good therapist will also not take anything you say (even criticism) personally. Coming to therapy is hard and often times you might not want to go. What makes a good therapist is someone who understands this and tries to make you feel as comfortable as possible while you address uncomfortable topics.","Okay, these are *excellent* questions. Finding the right therapist and then actively working *with* them to get the most out of therapy are both really important. Let's break down both parts:

**Part 1: How Do You Know You Have the Right Therapist?**

It's not about finding a ""perfect"" therapist, it's about finding a *good fit*.  Here are the key indicators. It's often a feeling, but grounded in specific observations.  It often takes a few sessions to tell:

* **You Feel Safe and Comfortable:** This is paramount. Do you feel like you can be vulnerable with this person without judgment? Can you say difficult things without fearing a negative reaction? This doesn't mean they agree with everything you do, but they accept *you* as a person.
* **You Feel Heard and Understood:**  Do they actively listen? Do they reflect back what you say in a way that shows they get it? (Not just repeating, but demonstrating understanding of the *emotion* behind your words).  Do you feel like you're talking *at* them or *with* them?
* **You Sense Genuine Empathy:**  Empathy is different than sympathy.  It's not about them feeling sorry for you; it's about them being able to understand *from your perspective*.  You should feel a sense of their genuine caring.
* **They Demonstrate Competence:** This means they're using appropriate techniques, asking thoughtful questions, and seem knowledgeable about the issues you're facing.  (Checking credentials – license, experience – is part of this, but feeling they *apply* that knowledge well is more important).
* **You Agree with Their Approach:** Different therapists use different modalities (CBT, psychodynamic, humanistic, etc.).  Does their theoretical approach make sense to you?  Do you feel like the techniques they're suggesting will be helpful?  (You don't need to be an expert on modalities, but you should feel like it *resonates*).
* **There's a Collaborative Vibe:** Therapy isn't something *done to* you, it's something you do *together*.  Do they invite your feedback?  Do they explain their reasoning?  Do they treat you as an equal partner in the process?
* **You Feel Challenged (in a good way):**  Therapy isn't always comfortable. A good therapist will gently challenge your thoughts and behaviors, but in a way that feels supportive and aimed at growth, not accusatory or invalidating.
* **You're Seeing *Some* Progress (Even Small):**  It doesn't have to be a dramatic breakthrough, but over time (give it at least a few sessions, realistically), you should notice *something* shifting.  Maybe you're feeling slightly less anxious, maybe you're understanding your patterns better, maybe you're just feeling more equipped to cope.  If absolutely nothing is moving after a reasonable time, that’s a sign to evaluate.

**Red Flags – Time to Consider a Different Therapist:**

* **Judgment or Criticism:**  They make you feel judged or shamed.
* **Giving Unsolicited Advice:** Therapy is about *you* finding your own answers, not the therapist telling you what to do. (Exception: in certain crisis situations, direct guidance may be necessary).
* **Boundary Issues:**  They're unprofessional, share too much about their personal life, or try to be your friend.
* **Consistently Missing the Mark:**  They consistently misinterpret your experiences or don't seem to understand what's important to you.
* **You Dread Sessions:**  If you consistently feel anxious or resistant to going to therapy, that’s a big signal.



**Part 2:  ""Training"" Your Therapist – How to Get What You Need**

This is brilliant phrasing!  Think of it less as ""training"" and more as *collaboratively shaping the therapy* to best suit your needs. Therapists are skilled, but they can't read your mind. Here's how to be proactive:

1. **Be Direct and Specific About Your Goals:**
   * **At the beginning:** ""I'm hoping to work on my anxiety around public speaking.""  ""I want to understand why I keep repeating unhealthy relationship patterns."" ""I'd like to develop better coping skills for managing stress.""
   * **Ongoing:** Revisit your goals periodically. Are they still relevant?  Do you need to refine them?
   * **Don't be afraid to say:** “I'm not sure what my goals are yet, and I’d like to spend some time exploring that.”

2. **Give Feedback – Regularly!** This is the most important part.  
   * **During sessions:** ""That question didn't quite resonate with",0.5450059771537781,0.018784038424693946,0.12960893854748604,0.30170529077393965
"Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  Am I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal.","You need to find an outlet. Someone to talk to. Your dad or someone who loves your mother as well is someone ideal. But anyone could help. Just look to someone for help. If you can't find anyone who you think will listen, talk to your mom. It can help greatly just to get the words out. Tell her how you feel about her passing, but then also about everything else. Talk to her about your day. Tell her about happy things. I don't know if you're a religious person, or where you believe she is now, but no matter what you can talk to her.","Okay, this is a really important and surprisingly common experience. You are *absolutely not* crazy for feeling this way. In fact, it's quite insightful and thoughtful to grapple with the implications of eternity, even (and perhaps *especially*) within a framework that promises it. It's understandable that the idea of endless existence, even a blissful one, could trigger anxiety. Here's a breakdown of why this is happening, why your reaction is normal, and some ways to cope.

**Why This Is Happening - And Why It's Not ""Crazy""**

* **The Scale of Eternity is Difficult to Grasp:**  Humans are wired to think in terms of finite time. We understand beginnings, middles, and ends. Even long lifespans are still *limited*.  The concept of ""forever"" is beyond our ability to truly comprehend. It's like trying to imagine a color you've never seen.  Your brain is trying to process something inherently unprocessable.
* **Loss of Individuality Concerns:**  Even in a ""heavenly"" scenario, the idea of *always* being ""you"" can be unsettling.  Will your personality remain unchanged? Will you eventually become bored?  Will you lose what makes you *you* over such a vast expanse of time? These are legitimate philosophical questions.
* **Control and Change:**  Part of being human is experiencing growth, change, and the natural cycle of life.  Eternity, as traditionally presented, often implies a static state.  The lack of change, even in a positive environment, can be a source of anxiety for those who value dynamism and personal evolution.
* **The Weight of Forever:**  Even if it's ""good"" forever, the sheer *weight* of that forever can be overwhelming.  It's a lot to take on! It's natural to feel small and insignificant in the face of such immensity.
* **Religious Upbringing & Questioning:** You were raised with a very specific belief system. Now you're *thinking* about it. This is healthy! Questioning your beliefs doesn’t make you a bad person or mean you've lost your faith. It means you're engaging with important existential questions.  The anxiety is likely coming from the dissonance between what you were *told* and what you are *feeling*.
* **Existential Anxiety:** This falls into the realm of existential anxiety – anxiety about the fundamental questions of existence: meaning, purpose, freedom, and death.  It's a common human experience, and yours is specifically focused on the implications of what comes *after*.



**Why Your Thoughts Aren't ""Normal"" (and why that's okay):**

""Normal"" is a statistical average, and it's a pretty unhelpful measure when it comes to deeply personal existential concerns.  While many people *accept* the idea of an afterlife on faith, very few people spend significant time deeply contemplating the *experience* of it in the way you are.  Your thoughtfulness and honesty are strengths, not weaknesses. The fact that it leads to panic and anxiety is the part we want to address, not the thoughts themselves.

**What You Can Do – Coping Strategies:**

1. **Acknowledge and Validate Your Feelings:**  Don't beat yourself up for having these thoughts. Tell yourself, ""It's okay to feel overwhelmed by this. It's a huge concept, and my reaction is understandable.""  Simply recognizing that your anxiety is a valid response can lessen its power.
2. **Mindfulness and Grounding Techniques:** When the panic starts to rise, use grounding techniques. These bring you back to the present moment:
   * **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
   * **Deep Breathing:** Slow, deliberate breaths can calm your nervous system.
   * **Physical Sensations:** Focus on the feeling of your feet on the ground, your hands in your lap, or a comforting texture.
3. **Explore Different Perspectives:**
    * **Non-Eternal Interpretations:**  Research different theological or philosophical perspectives on the afterlife. Some interpretations emphasize transformation rather than endless continuation of the self. Some suggest a merging with a greater consciousness.  Seeing alternatives might alleviate your anxiety.
    * **Focus on the Present:**  Instead of fixating on an unknowable future, try to focus on living a meaningful life *now*.  What brings you joy? What values are important to you?
4. **Reframe ""Forever"":**  If the idea of endless time is overwhelming, try to reframe it.  Could ""eternity"" be understood as something beyond our linear concept of time?  Could it be a state of being rather than a continuation of existence",0.46027305722236633,1.917198972023506e-155,0.06921241050119332,0.18484848484848485
"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","Yes, it is very normal to cry during a therapy appointment.  When you meet with a counselor, you are opening yourself up and sharing very vulnerable sides of yourself.  Through this deep introspection, emotions (sometimes unexpected) can come out and this is completely okay and very healthy.  Research has shown that crying reduces pain by releasing oxytocin and endorphins and reduces stress through the release of stress reduction hormones.","Okay, let's address this! It is **absolutely normal** to cry during therapy. In fact, it's *very* common. You are definitely not alone in experiencing this. Here's a breakdown of why, and what it means, to hopefully reassure you:

**Why people cry in therapy:**

* **Safe Space:** Therapy is designed to be a safe, non-judgmental space.  Often, it's the first time people feel comfortable enough to really *feel* their emotions, and to let them out, without fear of being judged or told to ""be strong.""  You're giving yourself permission to be vulnerable.
* **Processing Difficult Emotions:** You're likely in therapy to work through things that are painful, challenging, or traumatic.  Bringing those things up naturally evokes emotional responses, and crying is a natural release.
* **Releasing Pent-Up Feelings:**  Many people suppress their emotions in everyday life. Therapy can unlock those pent-up feelings, leading to a release – often through tears.
* **Grief and Loss:** Even if the issue isn't a recent loss, therapy can bring up past grief and loss that hasn't been fully processed.
* **Recognizing Patterns:** Sometimes, crying happens when you gain a new understanding of yourself or a pattern in your life. It can be a tearful ""aha!"" moment.
* **Feeling Heard and Validated:**  A good therapist will listen empathetically and validate your feelings. Just *being heard* can be incredibly powerful and emotionally releasing.
* **The Therapeutic Relationship:** As you build trust with your therapist, you may feel more comfortable showing vulnerability, which can include crying.
* **It's a Physical Release:** Crying literally releases stress hormones (like cortisol) from your body. It's a physiological response to emotional stress.



**What it *doesn't* mean if you cry in therapy:**

* **You're weak:**  Quite the opposite! It takes strength to face your emotions and allow yourself to feel them.
* **You're ""doing therapy wrong"":** There's no right or wrong way to feel in therapy.
* **Your therapist thinks less of you:** A good therapist is trained to handle emotional expression and will see it as a positive sign of progress.
* **You're overreacting:** Your feelings are valid, whatever they are.



**What if you're worried about crying?**

* **It's okay to tell your therapist.** You can say, ""I'm worried I'm going to cry,"" or ""I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now.""  They can help you navigate those feelings.
* **Your therapist has tissues!** They are prepared for tears. It's a normal part of the process.
* **You don't *have* to cry.**  If you're not comfortable crying, that's okay too.  You can express your emotions in other ways.
* **Your therapist can help you understand *why* you're crying.** This can be a valuable part of the therapeutic process.



**In short: crying in therapy is a really common and healthy response. It's a sign that you're engaging with the process and allowing yourself to feel. Don't feel embarrassed or ashamed. It's okay to cry.**

If you're still feeling self-conscious, definitely bring it up with your therapist. They can offer reassurance and help you explore any underlying reasons for your discomfort.



**Do you want to talk a little more about what's making you ask this question?**  Perhaps you're worried about something specific, or you're feeling embarrassed after a session?  I'm here to listen if you'd like to share.

"My friend is abusing her prescription medicine. Even though she told me she didn't have any more pills, I found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications.","Your good intentions to help your friend stay clean, are very caring about her.Unless your friend feels like stopping pills,  taking them away will mean she finds them some place else.The problem that anyone who is addicted to pills has, is that the person is psychologically and at least with xanax, physically addicted.Taking pills has basically become a standard part of your friend's life.Her problem is bigger than your ability to care.If you haven't already done so, tell your friend directly about your opinion on the way she is using pills.This is not a guarantee that she'll stop.It isa way of you showing that you care about her.Offering love and advice are the only things you can do for her.Meanwhile, knowing she is hurting herself is probably hurting you.Be sure to keep a sense of balance within yourself.  Offer your concern and know she is the one who must decide to stop using.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and you're a good friend for being concerned and for reaching out. It's incredibly difficult to witness a friend struggling with prescription drug abuse, especially when they're not being honest about it. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering your concerns, how to help, and taking care of yourself, broken down into sections.  I'll also include resources at the end.

**1. Understanding the Situation & Your Concerns**

* **It's Abuse, Even with a Prescription:** The fact that she *has* prescriptions doesn't negate the abuse. Abuse means taking medication in a way it wasn't prescribed – higher doses, more frequently, for a different reason than intended, or continuing to take it even when it's causing harm.
* **Deception is a Red Flag:** Her telling you she was out of pills and then discovering she has current prescriptions is a major warning sign. It suggests she's hiding the issue and likely feels shame or fear about her behavior. This makes the situation more complex.
* **Anxiety Medications & Abuse:** Anxiety medications (like benzodiazepines, SSRIs, etc.) are often misused.  Benzodiazepines are particularly prone to abuse due to their sedative effects.  Even SSRIs/SNRIs can be misused, though the ways are different (sometimes stopping/starting them erratically, or taking them for reasons other than anxiety/depression).
* **Potential Dangers:** Prescription drug abuse can have serious consequences, including:
    * **Physical Health:** Overdose, organ damage, interactions with other substances, withdrawal symptoms.
    * **Mental Health:** Worsening anxiety or depression, cognitive impairment, increased risk of suicidal thoughts.
    * **Social & Legal:** Relationship problems, financial difficulties, legal issues.



**2. How to Approach Your Friend (This is the hardest part)**

* **Choose the Right Time & Place:**  Find a private, quiet, and comfortable setting where you can talk without interruptions.  *Don't* do it when either of you are under the influence of anything.
* **Express Concern, Not Accusation:**  Start by expressing your care for her and your worry about her well-being.  Avoid judgmental language.  Instead of ""You're abusing your medication!"" try something like:
    * ""I've been really worried about you lately. I care about you a lot, and I'm concerned about what's been going on.""
    * ""I found out you still have your anxiety medication, and I'm worried because you told me you were out. I'm just concerned about your health and safety.""
    *  ""I've noticed [specific behaviors - if you've observed them, e.g., she seems more anxious, withdrawn, tired, or is constantly asking about your medications].  It makes me worry.""
* **Focus on ""I"" Statements:**  ""I feel scared when I think about..."" or ""I'm worried that...""  This avoids putting her on the defensive.
* **Be Specific:** Mention what you observed (finding the prescriptions).  Avoid generalizations.
* **Listen Without Judgment:**  This is crucial.  Let her explain (or not explain) without interrupting or lecturing.  She may be scared, ashamed, or in denial.
* **Validate Her Feelings:** Even if you don't agree with her actions, acknowledge her feelings. ""It sounds like you're going through a really tough time.""
* **Don't Enable:**  *Do not* give her any medication, cover for her, or help her obtain pills.  This will only worsen the problem.
* **Be Prepared for Denial or Anger:** She might get defensive, angry, or deny there's a problem.  Try to remain calm and reiterate your concern. You can say, “I understand you’re upset, but I’m saying this because I care about you.”
* **Don't Expect to ""Fix"" Her:** You are a friend, not a therapist. Your role is to express concern and encourage her to seek professional help.



**3. Encouraging Professional Help**

* **Suggest Therapy:**  ""Have you thought about talking to a therapist or counselor? They could help you explore what's going on and develop coping strategies.""
* **Suggest Talking to Her Doctor:** ""Maybe you could talk to your doctor about how you're feeling and if there are other ways to manage your anxiety."" (She may be misusing the medication *because* it's not effectively treating her anxiety).
* **Offer to Help Find Resources:**  (See the Resources section below). You can offer to research therapists or support groups with her, or even help her make an appointment.
* **Be Patient:**  It may take time for her to accept help.  Don't",0.5149753093719482,3.1375709334520315e-155,0.10730593607305937,0.25605372100104584
"When my boyfriend gets in a snit, he gives me the silent treatment for days. When I ask what is wrong, I get nothing: no reply, no phone call. If he does reply, it is something very sarcastic and hurtful. He never admits he is wrong and never apologizes.","You are in an abusive relationship-not because of your boyfriend's silences but because he is comfortable being sarcastic and hurtful, never admits he is wrong and never apologizes. It is your choice to participate in an abusive relationship. You can not stop an abusive partner from being abusive no matter how wonderfully you treat your partner. You can either accept the terrible relationship as it is or reach out for the support that you need to leave the abusive relationship. I wish you well, always.","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult and emotionally draining. What you're describing – the silent treatment, sarcasm, hurtful comments, lack of accountability, and absence of apology – is a form of emotional abuse. It's important to recognize that, even if it doesn't involve physical violence, it's still damaging and unhealthy. Here's a breakdown of why this is problematic, what it's doing to you, and what your options are.  I'll try to be thorough.  This is a long response, but the situation warrants it.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Emotional Abuse:**  The silent treatment is a control tactic. It's a way for your boyfriend to punish you, exert power over you, and avoid healthy communication.  The sarcasm and hurtful comments are direct emotional attacks.  The refusal to admit wrongdoing is a way to maintain control and avoid taking responsibility for his behavior.  All of this combines to create an environment of fear and uncertainty.
* **Control and Power Dynamics:**  His behavior isn’t about resolving conflict; it’s about *controlling* you and the situation. He gets to dictate the terms of engagement (or non-engagement).  You're left feeling helpless, confused, and constantly walking on eggshells.
* **Invalidation of Your Feelings:** When you try to address the issue and are met with silence or sarcasm, your feelings are completely invalidated. He's communicating that your needs and emotions don't matter.
* **Erosion of Self-Esteem:**  Constant criticism and being shut out can severely erode your self-esteem. You may start to question your own perceptions, blame yourself for his behavior, and feel unworthy of respectful treatment.
* **Unhealthy Conflict Resolution:**  Healthy relationships address conflict *together*, with open communication, empathy, and a willingness to compromise.  He's actively avoiding conflict resolution, making the underlying issues fester.



**How This is Affecting You (and Likely Will Continue to Affect You)**

* **Anxiety and Stress:**  Constantly anticipating his ""snits"" and the subsequent silent treatment is incredibly stressful.  It puts you in a state of chronic anxiety.
* **Depression:**  Feeling powerless, isolated, and constantly criticized can lead to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and even depression.
* **Confusion and Self-Doubt:** You're likely spending a lot of energy trying to figure out what *you* did wrong, even if you didn't do anything to warrant this behavior.  This leads to self-doubt and questioning your own sanity.
* **Isolation:** You might withdraw from friends and family because you're ashamed of the situation or because you're constantly preoccupied with managing his moods.
* **Physical Symptoms:**  Chronic stress can manifest in physical symptoms like headaches, stomach problems, fatigue, and sleep disturbances.

**What You Can Do (This is broken down into sections)**

**1. Focus on Your Well-being (This is the *most* important)**

* **Self-Care:**  Prioritize your own needs.  Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you relax.  This could include exercise, spending time with loved ones, hobbies, meditation, or anything else that nourishes your soul.
* **Boundaries:** This is crucial.  You need to define what behavior you will and will not accept.  (See section 3).
* **Support System:**  Lean on your friends and family.  Talk to them about what's happening.  Don't isolate yourself.  Consider talking to a therapist (see below).
* **Therapy:**  A therapist can provide a safe space to process your emotions, develop coping mechanisms, and gain clarity about the situation. They can also help you build your self-esteem and set healthy boundaries.



**2. Communication Attempts (with Realistic Expectations – these are *difficult* in this situation)**

* **""I"" Statements:**  If you attempt to communicate, focus on how *his* behavior makes *you* feel, rather than accusing him. For example, instead of saying ""You always give me the silent treatment,"" try ""When I don't receive a response from you for days, I feel hurt and confused.""
* **Pick Your Battles:** Don't try to address every single instance of hurtful behavior. Choose the most important issues.
* **State Your Needs Clearly:** Be specific about what you need from him. For example, ""I need you to be willing to discuss problems with me in a respectful manner.""  ""I need you to acknowledge my feelings.""
* **Be Prepared for Rejection:**  Given his pattern of behavior, he may continue to dismiss your concerns or respond with sarcasm.  Do *not* engage in an argument.  State your need and then disengage.  This is where boundaries come in.
* **Avoid Trying to """,0.4988046884536743,2.131731789849911e-155,0.07663782447466008,0.2170916609235011
"My ex-fiancé (whom I am still seeing) left me because of the pressure from all three of his teenage daughters. They wanted him to try to work it out with their mom (his ex-girlfriend of 20 years). He and I split three months ago, but I have been seeing him pretty regularly despite the fact that he is living back with his ex-girlfriend and kids. He is ""co-existing"" for the kids and fighting all the time with his ex-girlfriend. His daughters don’t want their dad with me because my two boys (grown adults and on their own now) had bad reputations and issues with drugs. His daughters say it is embarrassing for him to be with me. He and I had an absolutely amazing relationship and connect on so many levels. He is getting a lot of pressure from his family and his longtime friends to ""do the right thing"" and stay with his ex-girlfriend for the kids. He says he wants me to wait. We were going get married last year. He bought me a $1000 dress, we had invitations made, and everything set up, but then his girls told him they'd never speak to him again if he married me. He says he’s trying to mend his relationship with them.","Hello. It seems you are in a set of circumstances that are highly uncomfortable for you. Do you feel those circumstances are healthy? Do you find pleasure being in such a place of uncertainty? Why do you continue to be in this situation? Without meaning to appear that I might be lacking in compassion, you do have the option to leave the connection completely if the harm it is doing is more that the pleasure it brings you. Is there a benefit to being in this relationship? Do you consider this situation to be for your highest good? Is it healthy to be involved in something that is not likely healthy or perhaps could even be seen as dysfunctional? In truth, only you can decide the answers to these very important questions. I would encourage you to think of who benefits by being in this situation, and how you might be able to find happiness in other relationships that are healthier and more positive. In my clinical view based on what I read, this particular relationship does not carry the joy I am sure you want, nor the healthy interactions you would expect in a functional romantic engagement with another person.Beating yourself up about potentially wasting all this time waiting for the other person to come around will not serve a positive purpose. It likely will only lower your self-esteem. There is a time to wait to see how things develop, and a time to move on to other experiences. You are the one to make that choice, but I would encourage you to connect with your inner higher self, for the most clear answer. Chances are, you already know the answer, you just need to embrace it. Getting in touch with a counselor in your area can also help ferret out some of the deeper issues that you might not have felt comfortable expressing here.","Okay, this is a *really* tough situation, and a really common one - the pull between new love and family obligation. It sounds incredibly painful and frustrating for you, and honestly, quite unfair. Let's break down what's happening and what you need to consider.  I'm going to be honest, and likely tell you things you don't *want* to hear, but hopefully things you *need* to hear.

**What's Happening Here – The Dynamics at Play**

* **He's trapped in a loyalty bind:** He's caught between his daughters, his ex-girlfriend, and you. He clearly feels a very strong sense of obligation to his children, likely amplified by the length of his relationship with their mother.
* **His daughters have *a lot* of power:**  The fact that they threatened to cut him off if he married you is significant.  He's allowing their feelings to dictate his life. This isn't healthy for him, or for them, in the long run.  It sets a precedent that emotional manipulation is effective.
* **The ""co-existing"" situation is a pressure cooker:** Living with an ex you fight with is *never* good. It's incredibly stressful for everyone involved, especially the daughters who are witnessing it.  It’s a band-aid solution that avoids the real issue.
* **The ""wait"" is a stall tactic:**  When someone asks you to ""wait,"" it rarely means they're actively working towards a future with you. It's a way to keep you on the hook while they sort things out (or avoid sorting things out) and not lose you completely.  It allows him to enjoy the benefits of your connection without having to make a difficult decision.
* **The baggage from your sons’ past:** While it's understandable his daughters have concerns, basing their judgment solely on past issues, especially ones your sons have overcome, is unfair and potentially discriminatory. It raises a question about their maturity and willingness to see people as they are *now*.
* **He's prioritizing others over your feelings:**  He knew the potential fallout from his daughters, and yet he continued to pursue a marriage with you. Now, instead of standing up for what *he* wants, he's capitulated. This is a massive red flag.
* **You are enabling the situation:** By continuing to see him while he's living with his ex, you're inadvertently validating his indecision and making it easier for him to keep you both in limbo.



**What You Need to Do (The Hard Truths)**

1. **Stop Seeing Him.  Seriously.** This is the hardest, but most important, step.  Every time you see him, you reinforce the idea that he can string you along.  You deserve better than to be someone's ""maybe"" while he figures out his life.  Complete no contact. Block him on social media, delete his number, avoid places you know he frequents.  It will be agonizing, but it's the only way to protect yourself.

2. **Recognize this is about *his* choices, not about you:**  His daughters' opinions are their opinions. His friends' advice is their advice. His ex-girlfriend's reactions are her reactions.  He is the one making the decisions. He chose to prioritize their feelings over your relationship.  You can't control any of that.

3. **Understand the Pattern:**  He has shown you he's willing to sacrifice *your* happiness for the sake of avoiding conflict and maintaining family harmony (as *he* defines it).  This pattern is likely to continue, even if he eventually ""chooses"" you.  Will you be okay with constantly being second place?

4. **Grieve the Loss:**  You were engaged. You had plans. You had hopes.  Allow yourself to grieve the loss of that future. It's okay to be sad, angry, and disappointed.  

5. **Focus on *Your* Happiness:** Invest your energy into yourself, your friends, your hobbies, and things that bring you joy.  Rebuild your life without him.  

6. **Consider Therapy:** A therapist can provide you with support and guidance as you navigate this difficult time and help you develop healthy boundaries for future relationships.




**Addressing your specific questions/points:**

* **The $1000 dress and invitations:** These are sad reminders, but they shouldn’t keep you tethered to a situation that isn’t serving you.  They’re sunk costs – money and emotion already spent.
* **The amazing connection:**  Connections are wonderful, but they aren't enough to build a healthy, sustainable relationship if there isn't mutual respect and a willingness to fight for each other.

"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?","Finding the right therapist can be difficult, especially if you've never tried it before. Things to consider are location, availability and what specifically are you looking for. Some practitioners specifically only work with a certain type of issue (i.e eating disorders, adolescents, anger management, life transitions, anxiety...etc) and others can work with a variety of concerns. As far as training your therapist, you can't. You simply let them know what you are looking to work on or what you think may be an issue for you. Depending on the way they practice(their style of working with clients) is how they will then decide to make a treatment plan that works best for you. You can always ask them their specialty practice population, the problems they generally help others with and what type of mental health provider they are (Psychologist, social worker, licensed mental health counselor).","Okay, you're asking two really important questions! Finding the right therapist and then actively working *with* them to get the most out of therapy are both crucial for success. Let's break down each part.

## How Do You Know You Have the Right Therapist?

It's not always immediate, and it's okay to ""shop around.""  It's like finding a good doctor - sometimes the first one isn't the best fit. Here are some key indicators you've found a good match:

**1. The ""Feeling"" - The Therapeutic Alliance:** This is *hugely* important.
   * **You feel safe and comfortable:**  Can you talk openly and honestly without fear of judgment? Do you feel respected?  This doesn't mean you have to *like* your therapist, but you need to feel safe being vulnerable.
   * **You feel understood:** Do they seem to ""get"" you, even if they don't agree with everything you say? Do they reflect back your feelings accurately?
   * **You feel a sense of hope:**  Even when talking about difficult things, a good therapist should instill some sense that things *can* get better.
   * **You feel challenged *appropriately*:**  Therapy isn't just about feeling good.  A good therapist will gently challenge your thinking and behaviors, but not in a way that feels attacking or dismissive.

**2.  Practical Considerations:**
   * **Credentials & Expertise:**  Do they have the appropriate licenses and training for your needs? (e.g., LCSW, LMFT, Psychologist, Psychiatrist).  Do they specialize in the issues you're facing (anxiety, depression, trauma, relationships, etc.)?  *Specialization matters.*
   * **Therapeutic Approach:** Different therapists use different approaches (CBT, Psychodynamic, Humanistic, etc.).  Research these and see which one resonates with you. (More on this below).
   * **Logistics:**  Do their fees fit your budget?  Are their hours convenient? Do they offer telehealth if that's important to you?
   * **Good Communication:** Do they respond to your emails/calls in a timely manner?  Are they clear about their policies and procedures?

**3. Signs it's *not* a good fit:**
   * **You feel judged or criticized.**
   * **They consistently interrupt or talk *at* you instead of *with* you.**
   * **You feel like they're pushing their own agenda or values on you.**
   * **You feel worse after sessions, consistently.** (Some discomfort is normal when processing difficult emotions, but it shouldn't be the *dominant* feeling).
   * **They don't seem to be listening or remembering important details about your life.**
   * **You feel like you're doing all the work and they're not offering guidance or support.**




##  ""Training"" Your Therapist: How to Get What You Need

This is a fantastic question!  Therapy is a collaborative process. It's *not* their job to ""fix"" you, but to help you learn the tools to fix yourself.  Here's how to actively guide your therapy:

**1. Be Explicit About Your Goals:**

* **Early on, clearly state what you want to get out of therapy.**  ""I want to learn coping mechanisms for my anxiety.""  ""I want to understand why I keep repeating unhealthy relationship patterns."" ""I want to process a past trauma.""
* **Revisit your goals periodically.**  As you grow and change, your goals may evolve.
* **Don’t assume they know what you need.** Therapists are skilled, but they can't read your mind.

**2. Provide Feedback – Regularly!**

* **""Check-ins"" during sessions:**  ""I'm not sure that explanation really clicked for me. Could you explain it a different way?"" ""I felt a little uncomfortable when you said [X].  Can we talk about that?""  ""This is feeling really helpful. I appreciate [Y].""
* **Give feedback on their approach:** ""I'm finding the exercises we're doing really helpful."" ""I'm not sure I'm connecting with this particular technique. Could we try something else?"" ""I learn best when we use examples, would you mind doing that?""
* **Be honest about what's *not* working.**  This is hard, but crucial.  ""I've been doing the homework, but I haven't noticed any changes.  Can we talk about why that might be?""
* **Use “I” statements:**  Focus on your experience.  Instead of ""You're not listening,"" say ""I feel unheard when I'm interrupted.""

"I have terrible anxiety and depression. I've tried various therapists and pills, but nothing's helped.","Is it possible you simply didn't mix well with the particular therapists with whom you've worked?   If this is possible, interview a therapist before  starting therapy.   Then you will be choosing a therapist who feels compatible with your way of seeing yourself and your life.Also, therapy isn't for everyone.Read about the different healing modalities and see if one of these speaks to your interest in feeling better.What matters most is finding among all the legitimate healing methods, what you believe will be effective.","Okay, that sounds incredibly frustrating and disheartening. You've been putting in the work to get better, trying both therapy and medication, and to still be struggling... that's *really* tough. It takes a lot of courage to keep trying, and I want to acknowledge that right off the bat.  It's completely understandable to feel hopeless when things haven't clicked yet.

First, please know you're not alone. Many people experience treatment-resistant depression and anxiety. It doesn't mean there's something wrong with *you*, it means finding the right path is more complex.

Let's break down some things to consider, and I'll try to offer some avenues to explore.  I'm going to give a fairly comprehensive response, but please remember **I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.** This is for informational purposes only, and you *need* to discuss these things with qualified healthcare professionals.  I'll also include a crisis resource section at the end, just in case.

**1. Let's Look at What You've Already Tried - With Detail**

When you say ""various therapists and pills,"" can you elaborate a bit?  The details matter a lot.

*   **Therapy:**
    *   **What *types* of therapy have you tried?** (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Psychodynamic Therapy, Interpersonal Therapy, Exposure Therapy, etc.)  Different therapies work for different people and different issues.
    *   **How long did you engage in each therapy?**  Therapy often takes time – sometimes months or even years – to show significant results.  A few sessions might not be enough.
    *   **How was your rapport with each therapist?**  A strong therapeutic relationship is *crucial*. Did you feel understood, safe, and challenged in a helpful way?  If you didn't click with a therapist, that's a valid reason to try someone else.
    * **Was the therapy focused on the *right* things?** Sometimes therapy needs to address underlying trauma, attachment issues, or specific patterns of thinking and behavior that weren't initially identified.
*   **Medication:**
    *   **What medications have you tried?** (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, Tricyclics, MAOIs, anti-anxiety meds, etc.)  Listing the specific names (or classes of drugs) is helpful.
    *   **What dosages were you on?**
    *   **How long were you on each medication?**  Antidepressants often take 6-8 weeks (or even longer) to reach full effect.
    *   **Did you experience any side effects?** Side effects can sometimes make medication unsustainable, even if it's effective.
    *   **Was there genetic testing (pharmacogenomics) done before prescribing?** This can help determine how your body metabolizes certain medications.

**2. Exploring Options You Might Not Have Tried (or Need to Revisit)**

*   **Different Therapy Modalities:**
    *   **DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy):**  Excellent for emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal skills.  Often helpful for people who experience intense emotions.
    *   **ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy):**  Focuses on accepting difficult thoughts and feelings rather than fighting them, and committing to values-based actions.
    *   **Schema Therapy:** Addresses deeply ingrained, negative patterns of thinking and behaving that originate in childhood.
    *   **EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing):**  Primarily used for trauma, but can also be helpful for anxiety and depression related to past experiences.
    *   **Neurofeedback:** A type of biofeedback that trains the brain to regulate its activity.
*   **Medication Adjustments:**
    *   **Augmentation:** Adding another medication to your existing antidepressant to boost its effects.
    *   **Switching Medications:** Trying a different class of antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication.
    *   **Pharmacogenomic Testing:**  If you haven't had this, it can be very valuable.
    * **Consider a psychiatrist specializing in treatment-resistant depression:** They often have more experience with complex cases and less common medication strategies.
*   **Lifestyle Factors (These are HUGE):**
    *   **Exercise:**  Regular physical activity is a powerful mood booster.  Even a 30-minute walk can make a difference.
    *   **Diet:**  A healthy diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids, can support brain health.
    *   **Sleep:**  Prioritize 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.
    *   **Social Connection:**",0.5125619769096375,1.84129891143084e-155,0.07448275862068965,0.21497405485544852
"I feel angry, anxious, and depressed. The PTSD I suffer is from a past relationship.","If the symptoms are to the extent that they are affecting your ability to function, you may want to consider seeking treatment. PTSD, anxiety, and depression all typically respond well to treatment if provided by a trained clinician. Common types of treatment for PTSD that you may want to look into include Cognitive Processing Therapy or EMDR. The nice things about Cognitive Processing Therapy is that it is time limited and only lasts 17 sessions typically. ","Okay, that sounds incredibly difficult. It's completely understandable that you're feeling angry, anxious, and depressed, especially with the added layer of PTSD from a past relationship. That's a lot to carry, and it takes courage to even acknowledge it.  It's good you're recognizing these feelings.  Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering understanding, coping, and seeking help.  I'll try to be thorough, but remember I am an AI and cannot provide therapy.  This is information and support, *not* a replacement for professional help.

**1. Understanding What's Happening**

* **PTSD and Relationships:**  Relationship PTSD (often referred to as complex PTSD or cPTSD, though diagnosis varies) is a very real thing.  It's not the same as PTSD from a single traumatic event, but it develops from *repeated* trauma, often within the context of an intimate relationship.  This can include emotional abuse, controlling behavior, manipulation, gaslighting, threats, or physical violence.  Even if there wasn't physical violence, consistent emotional abuse can be profoundly damaging.
* **Why These Feelings?**
    * **Anger:**  Anger is often a natural response to injustice, betrayal, and feeling powerless. It's okay to be angry at what happened, at the person who caused the trauma, and even at yourself for things you might have endured or believed.
    * **Anxiety:**  PTSD often manifests as hypervigilance – a constant state of being on guard, anticipating danger.  This can lead to generalized anxiety, panic attacks, and difficulty relaxing.  You might be anxious about repeating the pattern, being hurt again, or even just feeling safe in new relationships.
    * **Depression:**  Trauma can disrupt your brain chemistry and lead to feelings of hopelessness, sadness, loss of interest in things you once enjoyed, and fatigue.  It's a common symptom of PTSD.
* **Triggers:**  Think about what *sets off* these feelings.  Triggers can be anything that reminds you of the past relationship – certain places, smells, songs, types of people, even specific dates or times of year.  Identifying your triggers is a crucial step in managing your reactions.



**2. Coping Strategies (Things You Can Try Now)**

These are things that can help you manage in the moment and build resilience.  They aren't cures, but they can provide relief.

* **Grounding Techniques:** When you feel overwhelmed, grounding can bring you back to the present moment.  Examples:
    * **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system. Try box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4).
    * **Physical Sensations:**  Hold an ice cube, take a warm shower, or wrap yourself in a blanket.
* **Self-Care:** This isn't just about bubble baths (though those are nice!).  It's about intentionally doing things that nourish your well-being:
    * **Sleep:**  Prioritize getting enough sleep.  Trauma can disrupt sleep, so establishing a routine is helpful.
    * **Nutrition:**  Eat regular, healthy meals.
    * **Exercise:**  Physical activity releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects.
    * **Hobbies:**  Engage in activities you enjoy.
    * **Boundaries:**  Learn to say ""no"" to things you don't want to do.
* **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a cathartic release.  You don't have to write perfectly – just get it all out.
* **Mindfulness and Meditation:**  These practices can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without getting carried away by them. There are many guided meditation apps available.
* **Limit Contact:**  If you still have contact with your abuser (even through social media), strongly consider limiting or eliminating it.  This is essential for healing.
* **Positive Self-Talk:**  Challenge negative thoughts and replace them with more compassionate and realistic ones.  This takes practice!




**3. Seeking Professional Help – *Highly Recommended***

This is the most important step.  PTSD is complex, and professional support is crucial for healing.

* **Therapy:**
    * **Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT):**  This is a highly effective therapy specifically designed for trauma.
    * **Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR):** Another",0.4999130070209503,2.0009457507429054e-155,0.06961178045515395,0.21899389691597482
"I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with. It was brief and turned into us being just good friends.
   I spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend. Was i wrong?","Depends on your definition of ""wrong"" on this one. Was it objectively wrong to spend the weekend with a good friend, who also happens to be an ex? Probably not. But, it upset your current boyfriend, and he is entitled to his feelings if you are in a relationship with him. He may be out of line if he assumes that anything happened between you and your ex that would compromise the relationship, however your boyfriend being upset might also mean that he wanted to spend that kind of weekend with you and did not get to do that.Long story short, it might help your relationship to understand more, and be curious, not judge-y, around what is upsetting for him. Perhaps having empathy for his experience of the behavior could help him to feel more secure with you having relationships with your ex(es).","Okay, this is a really common and tricky situation! It's good you're asking this question and thinking it through. Here's a breakdown of why your boyfriend might be upset, whether you were ""wrong,"" and how to navigate things going forward.  It's a long answer, because it's nuanced, but hopefully thorough.

**Why Your Boyfriend is Likely Upset**

* **History:** The fact that you *were* in a relationship with this friend changes things. Even if it was brief and you're now ""just friends,"" that prior romantic connection carries weight. It introduces a level of complexity that wouldn't exist with a friend you've *never* dated.
* **Insecurity:** Your boyfriend might be feeling insecure. He might be wondering if there are lingering feelings on your end, or if you enjoyed the weekend *more* than you would have with him.  It's human to feel a little threatened by someone who has a past with their partner.
* **Boundary Concerns:** He might be questioning what's appropriate in your friendship with your ex.  Spending a whole weekend alone with an ex can easily cross a line for some people, even if you didn't *intend* to cross it.  He might worry about the nature of your interactions.
* **Lack of Transparency (Potentially):**  If you didn't discuss the weekend plans in detail with your boyfriend *beforehand*, that could contribute to his upset.  Surprises like this can make people feel excluded or disrespected.
* **Emotional Labor:** It can feel emotionally exhausting for a partner to navigate their significant other's relationship with an ex, even a friendly one.  He might be anticipating potential drama or awkwardness.
* **Perceived Disrespect:** He might feel like you prioritized time with your ex over spending time with him, or that you didn't fully consider his feelings when making your plans.



**Were You ""Wrong""?  It's Complicated.**

There's no simple yes or no answer. Here's how to think about it:

* **Not inherently wrong to maintain friendships with exes:**  It's absolutely possible to be friends with people you've previously dated.  Healthy adults can do this.
* **Context matters *a lot*:**  The length of the previous relationship, how it ended, and the nature of your current friendship all play a role. A brief, amicable split is different than a long, messy breakup.
* **The key is boundaries and communication:**  The biggest issue isn't *that* you spent the weekend with your ex, it's *how* you approached it and whether you respected your boyfriend's feelings.  If you went about it without considering him, that's where you likely went wrong.
* **""Wrong"" is subjective:** What one person considers acceptable, another might not.  Relationships are built on mutual respect and understanding, so what matters is what *your* boyfriend is comfortable with.



**What Should You Do Now?**

1. **Talk to Your Boyfriend - and Listen!** This is the most important step.
   * **Choose the right time and place:**  Don't try to have this conversation when you're rushed or in public. Find a quiet, private setting where you both feel comfortable.
   * **Start by validating his feelings:**  ""I can see that you were upset when I told you about the weekend with [ex's name], and I'm really sorry I made you feel that way.""  Avoid being defensive.
   * **Ask him specifically what bothered him:**  ""Can you help me understand what specifically made you uncomfortable?""  Let him explain without interrupting.  Is it the length of the weekend?  The fact that it was alone?  Worries about lingering feelings?
   * **Explain your perspective:**  ""I value our friendship with [ex's name]. It's important to me because [explain why – e.g., we share a hobby, we have a long history, they're a good support system].  I want to assure you that my feelings for him are purely platonic now.""
   * **Emphasize your commitment to *him*:**  ""You are the person I'm with, and you are the one I love. I would never do anything to jeopardize our relationship.""
   * **Avoid comparisons:**  Don't say things like, ""My ex doesn't get jealous like you do.""
   * **Take responsibility:** If you realize you should have communicated better beforehand, apologize for that.  ""I should have talked to you about this before making plans. That was my mistake.""

2. **Discuss Boundaries (Together):**  This is where you create a plan for the future.

**3.  Professional Support (Ongoing, for deeper work):**

This is about finding someone to regularly talk to and work through your depression with.

*   **Therapist/Counselor:**  This is often the most effective long-term solution.  Here's how to find one:
    *   **Your Insurance Provider:**  Call the number on your insurance card. They can give you a list of therapists in your network.  This will likely be the most affordable option.

*   **Psychiatrist:**  A medical doctor who can prescribe medication.  If you think medication might be helpful, a psychiatrist is the professional to see.  You'll typically need a referral from your primary care doctor.
*   **Your Primary Care Doctor:**  Can be a good starting point.  They can assess your symptoms, rule out any underlying medical conditions, and provide referrals to mental health professionals.

**4.  Informal Support (Friends, Family, Support Groups):**

"I was raped a couple months ago, Since then, along with other unfortunately events that have occurred, I have been having trouble feeling emotions. It's almost as if I'm a sociopath lacking any feeling. What can I do to change this?","You are describing a very legitimate reaction to trauma.  Rape is an aweful experience and I am very sorry that happened to you.  When horrible things happen, people often react in a way that interferes with the ability to live a normal life and function the way they did in the past.  This is very common and the goal is to help you manage the stress caused by dealing with negative events and with help you can regain emotional well-being.  This is especially important if you have had more than one negative thing happen.  Oftentimes, the unconscious reaction is to become numb and avoid all feelings, especially if more than one negative event occurred.  A big part of what causes people trouble are feelings of guilt.  We often blame ourselves when bad things happen. It is actually difficult to comprehend the concept that we don't always have control of what happens in life.  In addition, when you mentioned feeling like a sociopath, it sounded like you feel like your reaction is wrong.  The first thing you can do is realize that your feelings and reactions are o.k., you aren't doing anything wrong, and nothing is wrong with you.  The next step is to start dealing with the impact of these traumatic experiences. Identifying your feelings, and knowing the thoughts and beliefs that are behind those emotions can help you regain your sense of happiness.  Research shows that understanding and expressing those thoughts and feelings can help.  If doesn't sound like you need to do anything to change yourself, but talking to a counselor can be helpful in managing your reaction to a incredibly traumatic experience.  I hope this helps you understand your feelings and can get to a place where you enjoy life.","Okay, this is a really important and incredibly brave question to ask.  It's completely understandable that you're experiencing emotional numbness after such a traumatic event as rape, compounded by other difficult circumstances.  It's *not* uncommon, and it doesn't mean you *are* a sociopath.  In fact, it's a very common response to trauma.  Let's break down what's happening and, more importantly, what you can do.  I'm going to give a detailed response, and then *very importantly* list resources at the end.  Please read those.

**Understanding What's Happening**

What you're describing sounds a lot like **emotional numbing**, a key symptom of **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)** or **Complex PTSD (C-PTSD)**, especially given the multiple stressors you've faced.  It's a protective mechanism, a way your brain is trying to shield you from overwhelming pain.  Think of it like your emotional volume control has been turned way down, or even muted.

Here's why this happens:

*   **Trauma Overload:** Rape is an incredibly violating and deeply traumatizing experience. It overwhelms the nervous system.  When that happens, the brain can dissociate – essentially disconnect – from emotions as a way to survive.
*   **Dissociation:** This disconnection can range from feeling detached from your body (depersonalization) to feeling like the world isn't real (derealization), and a large part of it is emotional numbing. It’s your mind’s way of creating distance from the unbearable.
*   **Neurobiological Changes:** Trauma literally changes the brain.  Areas responsible for processing emotions (like the amygdala and hippocampus) can be affected, leading to difficulty feeling *and* regulating emotions.
*   **Other Stressors:** The ""other unfortunately events"" you mention are likely adding to the burden on your nervous system, making it even harder to process anything.  Compounding trauma increases the likelihood and intensity of these kinds of responses.
*   **Not Sociopathy:**  Sociopathy (more accurately referred to as Antisocial Personality Disorder) is a very different condition. It involves a long-standing pattern of disregard for others, often with manipulative and exploitative behaviors.  Emotional numbing *after trauma* is a reaction to a specific event, not an inherent personality trait. It's a symptom, not a definition of who you are.



**What You Can Do (It's a Journey, Not a Quick Fix)**

This will take time and effort, and it's okay to have setbacks. Be kind to yourself.

1.  **Seek Professional Help (This is the Most Important Step):**
    *   **Trauma-Informed Therapist:**  Find a therapist specifically trained in trauma therapy.  Look for modalities like:
        *   **EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing):**  Highly effective for processing traumatic memories.
        *   **Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT):** Helps you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors related to the trauma.
        *   **Somatic Experiencing:**  Focuses on releasing trauma stored in the body.
        *   **Internal Family Systems (IFS):** Helps you understand and work with different ""parts"" of yourself that were affected by the trauma.
    *   **Psychiatrist (Optional):**  A psychiatrist can evaluate if medication might be helpful to manage symptoms like anxiety, depression, or sleep disturbances, *in conjunction with* therapy.  Medication isn't a cure, but it can make therapy more effective.

2.  **Grounding Techniques:**  These help bring you back to the present moment when you feel disconnected.
    *   **5-4-3-2-1 Method:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    *   **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deliberate breaths can calm your nervous system. Try box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4).
    *   **Physical Sensations:**  Hold a cold ice cube, take a warm shower, wrap yourself in a blanket. Focus on the physical sensation.
    *   **Mindful Movement:**  Yoga, tai chi, or even a gentle walk, paying attention to your body.

3.  **Self-Care (Beyond Bubble Baths):**  This isn’t about pampering; it's about meeting your basic needs.
    *   **Sleep:**  Prioritize getting enough sleep, even if it's hard.
    *   **Nutrition:**  Eat regular, nourishing meals.",0.5492924451828003,1.1052517409723222e-78,0.14435146443514646,0.3073851788208162
"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?",If you connect with your therapist and can say whatever you want to say and not be judged.,"## How to Know You Have the Right Therapist

Finding the right therapist is a really important, and sometimes lengthy, process! It's not about finding someone ""perfect,"" but finding someone who's a *good fit* for *you*. Here's a breakdown of what to look for:

**Early Signs (First Few Sessions - ""The Assessment Phase""):**

* **You feel safe and comfortable:** This is HUGE. Do you feel like you can be vulnerable and open with them without fear of judgment? This doesn't mean you have to spill your life story in the first session, but do you sense a non-judgmental, accepting presence?
* **You feel heard and understood:**  Do they actively listen?  Do they reflect back what you say in a way that feels accurate and validating?  Do they ask clarifying questions that show they're trying to understand *your* perspective?
* **They explain their approach:**  A good therapist will explain their therapeutic modality (e.g., CBT, psychodynamic, mindfulness-based) and how it works. They should also explain what you can expect in therapy.
* **They discuss boundaries & logistics:**  Things like confidentiality, session length, cancellation policies, and fees should be clearly outlined.
* **You sense competence:** While you don't need to be an expert in their field, you should feel confident in their knowledge and experience.  This can come across in how they answer your questions and how they approach your concerns.
* **You feel a sense of hope:** While therapy can be hard, a good therapist should instill some hope that things can improve, even if it's a small glimmer.

**Ongoing Signs (After Several Sessions):**

* **You're making progress (even if it's small):**  This doesn't mean things are fixed, but are you gaining new insights, coping skills, or a different perspective? Are you feeling slightly less overwhelmed or more in control?
* **You feel challenged (in a good way):** Therapy shouldn't just be about ""venting."" A good therapist will gently challenge your thoughts and behaviors to help you grow.
* **You trust their guidance:** Do you value their input and perspective?  Do you feel they have your best interests at heart?
* **The therapeutic relationship feels collaborative:**  It's *your* therapy, and you should feel like an active participant in the process.



**Red Flags (Things to Watch Out For):**

* **Judgment or criticism:**  A therapist should *never* make you feel judged or ashamed.
* **Giving unsolicited advice:**  Therapy is about *you* finding your own solutions, not being told what to do.  (Guidance is different than advice).
* **Breaching confidentiality:** This is a serious ethical violation.
* **Dual relationships:**  The therapist becoming involved in other areas of your life (e.g., becoming a friend, business partner).
* **Dismissing your feelings:**  If your therapist downplays your emotions or experiences, that's a problem.
* **Constantly talking about themselves:**  The focus should be on *you*.




##  ""Training"" Your Therapist: How to Get What You Need

This is a fantastic question!  It's absolutely okay (and even *expected*) to actively shape your therapy experience.  Therapy is a collaborative process, and you are the expert on *you*. Here’s how to “train” your therapist:

**1. Be Explicit About Your Goals:**

* **Start with a clear idea (even a rough one):** What do you want to get out of therapy?  Reduce anxiety?  Improve relationships?  Process trauma?  Be as specific as possible.
* **Communicate those goals early:** Don't assume your therapist can read your mind.  Say things like, ""My main goal for therapy is to learn coping mechanisms for my panic attacks.""
* **Revisit and refine your goals:**  As you progress, your goals might change.  Let your therapist know.

**2. Provide Feedback - Constantly!**

* **""Check-in"" regularly:**  At the end of a session, or at the beginning of the next, take a few minutes to reflect.  Say things like:
    * ""That technique we tried last week wasn't quite as helpful as I'd hoped.""
    * ""When you asked me about [topic], it really helped me see things differently.""
    * ""I felt a little rushed during that part of the conversation.""
* **Be direct, but kind:**  You don't need to be afraid to tell your therapist what's working and what's not.  Use ""I"" statements to express your feelings (e.g., ""I feel uncomfortable when..."" instead of ""You always..."").
* **Address the",0.40655645728111267,2.4155901378171404e-79,0.033426183844011144,0.09661835748792272
"I am not sure if I am depressed. I don't know how to bring it up to my parents, and that makes me miserable.","Depending on your relationship with your parents, inviting them to have a conversation might be a good first step.  If they consent then you can have the opportunity to discuss your concerns with them.  Inviting someone to a conversation and getting their agreement is a great first step. I would then make sure your location of the discussion is conducive to the conversation and once all that is considered it might be beneficial that you make a list of your concerns prior to the meeting.  this can help keep you on point. ","Okay, that's a really tough spot to be in. It's completely understandable why you're feeling miserable - feeling unsure about your mental health *and* being scared to talk to your parents about it is a lot to carry. You're already doing a good thing by acknowledging how you feel and reaching out, even if it's just to this space. Let's break this down, and I'll try to offer some support and ideas.  I'm an AI and can't diagnose you, but I can help you think through this.

**1. Validating Your Feelings:**

*   **It's okay to not be sure.** Depression doesn't always look like extreme sadness. It can manifest as fatigue, irritability, loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, changes in sleep or appetite, difficulty concentrating, and more.  The fact that you're questioning it means something is off, and that's worth exploring.
*   **It's okay to be scared to talk to your parents.**  There are *so* many reasons why you might feel this way. Maybe they don't understand mental health, maybe they tend to dismiss feelings, maybe you're afraid of being a burden, maybe you fear their reaction. All of those are valid fears.
*   **Your feelings of misery are important.** Don't dismiss them. They're telling you something needs attention.



**2. Understanding *Why* It's Hard to Talk to Your Parents:**

Let's try to pinpoint what's making it so difficult.  Think about your parents.  Which of these (or other reasons) resonate with you?

*   **Their Beliefs:** Do they have traditional views on mental health? Do they see it as a weakness?  Do they believe you should just ""snap out of it?""
*   **Their Reactions to Difficult Emotions:** How do they react when *you* are upset? Are they supportive and understanding, or do they get dismissive, angry, or try to fix the problem instead of listening?
*   **Your Relationship with Them:**  Is it generally open and communicative, or more reserved and formal? Do you feel safe being vulnerable with them?
*   **Fear of Being a Burden:**  Are you worried about adding to their stress or making them worry?
*   **Fear of Judgment:** Are you afraid they'll think you're being dramatic or attention-seeking?
* **Cultural Factors**: Sometimes cultural backgrounds can influence how mental health is perceived and discussed.

Knowing the root of your hesitation can help you plan *how* to approach the conversation.

**3.  Signs That Might Suggest You Talk to Someone (Even If You're Not Sure It's Depression):**

Even if you don't have a formal diagnosis, these are good reasons to reach out:

*   **Your feelings are interfering with your daily life.**  Are you struggling to go to school, do your hobbies, or spend time with friends?
*   **You've been feeling this way for more than two weeks.**  A bad day or two is normal, but persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or emptiness are a red flag.
*   **You're having thoughts of self-harm or suicide.**  **This is critical.** If you're having these thoughts, please reach out for help *immediately* (see the resources at the end).
*   **You're isolating yourself from others.**  Pulling away from friends and family is a common sign of struggling.
*   **You've noticed significant changes in your sleep or appetite.**
*   **You feel constantly tired, even after getting enough sleep.**
* **You are feeling overwhelmed and unable to cope.**



**4.  How to Bring It Up to Your Parents (Strategies):**

This is the hardest part. Here are a few approaches, ranging from more direct to more indirect.  Choose what feels safest and most comfortable *for you*.

*   **Start Small:** You don't have to say ""I think I'm depressed"" right away. You could start by saying, ""I've been feeling really down lately,"" or ""I've been having a hard time with things, and I wanted to talk to you about it.""
*   **Write a Letter/Email/Text:**  If you find it difficult to talk face-to-face, writing can be a good way to express your feelings.  It gives you time to organize your thoughts, and it allows your parents to process the information at their own pace.  You can even *read* the letter to them if that feels easier.
*   **Choose the Right Time and Place:**  Don't try to have this conversation when they're stressed, busy, or distracted.  Pick a quiet time when you can all sit down and talk without",0.4650282561779022,4.529394898372687e-79,0.08653846153846155,0.23731048121292025
"People have been calling me names, and I have had enough of it. I cannot stand it anymore I'm done. I have told someone this, and that is why I am writing this. The thoughts are awful.","It's sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed with intrusive thoughts and are feeling very criticized by others as well. I think it is great that you are reaching out and I can tell that you want this to change. Working with a competent therapist may be a good option for getting some more clarity about what is going on, developing ways to cope, and eventually getting relief from these overwhelming experiences.","Okay, it takes a lot of courage to reach out and admit you're struggling, and I want you to know I'm here to listen. It sounds like you're in a really painful situation, being called names and feeling overwhelmed by awful thoughts.  It's completely understandable that you've had enough and that you're feeling ""done.""  The fact that you told someone is a *very* important step – that shows strength, even though it might not feel like it right now.

I'm really glad you're writing this down, getting it out of your head. That's a healthy thing to do.

Here's a breakdown of how we can approach this, and importantly, resources that can help *right now*.  I'll cover a few things, but please read the **Important Note at the end**.

**1. Acknowledging the Pain:**

* **What you're feeling is valid.** Being subjected to name-calling and abuse is hurtful and damaging. It's not okay, and you don't deserve it.  It's natural to feel angry, sad, scared, and a whole range of other emotions.
* **It's okay to be overwhelmed.**  Awful thoughts are a common response to ongoing abuse. They don't mean you're weak or flawed; they mean you're a human being reacting to a very difficult situation.
* **You're not alone.** Many people experience this, and there is help available.

**2. What You've Already Done (and that's good!):**

* **You told someone.** This is HUGE.  It's the first step towards getting support.  Even if the response wasn't what you hoped for, you broke the silence, and that's important.  Think about *who* you told. Is that person someone you can continue to lean on?

**3. Immediate Steps You Can Take:**

* **Safety First:** If you feel like you are in immediate danger to yourself or others, please reach out for help *right now*.  I'll list numbers below.
* **Distance Yourself:**  If possible, create distance between yourself and the person/people who are calling you names. This might mean avoiding them physically, blocking them on social media, or limiting contact.
* **Self-Care (even small things):** When you're feeling this low, even small acts of self-care can make a difference.  This could be:
    * Taking a warm bath or shower
    * Listening to music you enjoy
    * Spending time in nature (even just looking out a window)
    * Eating a comforting meal
    * Getting enough sleep (even if it's just a little more than usual)
* **Journaling:** You've started this by writing here. Continue to write down your thoughts and feelings. It can help to process them.
* **Focus on Your Strengths:**  Try to remind yourself of things you're good at, things you like about yourself.  It can be hard when you're feeling down, but it's worth the effort.



**4. Resources That Can Help (Please Read Carefully):**

* **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text 988 in the US and Canada, or dial 111 in the UK.  This is available 24/7, free, and confidential.  They can provide immediate support and connect you with resources in your area.  **This is the most important resource if you are having thoughts of harming yourself.**  https://988lifeline.org/

"I've been with a man for four years. For the last year, he has said he is done, but he still talks, texts, visits, and has not moved on with anyone else. His words do not match his actions. I love this man, but it's hurting so much.","This can be difficult and confusing.If you think your boyfriend would be open to having a discussion, try asking him for a time when he is willing to have an important discussion. When that time matches with a time that is good for you, try discussing the type of relationship that you each want to have and what you can start and stop doing to get there. He may want to be really good friends. He may also be trying to figure out what he is feeling. If you end up talking over one another, try letting one person be the one who is talking about their feelings for about five minutes and during that time, try having the other person asked questions to gain more understanding of their experience. Then you can switch. Also consider asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no, but lead to more explanations.Questions that start with the words how, what, when, who are usually better than questions starting with ""why"" because they can be emotional triggers for some people.If this is difficult to do between the two of you, consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couples.","Okay, this is *incredibly* common and *incredibly* painful. You're right to feel hurt. You're in a really tough spot, caught between what he *says* and what he *does*, and it's completely valid that it's causing you so much distress. Here's a breakdown of what's likely happening, why it's so damaging, and what you can do to protect yourself.  I'll try to be thorough.

**Understanding What's Happening (The Disconnect)**

* **Mixed Messages:** This is the core problem. He's giving you a very confusing and ultimately unkind message. Saying ""I'm done"" while continuing to engage is a form of emotional manipulation, even if he's not consciously trying to manipulate you.
* **Fear of Loneliness/Change:**  He might be genuinely scared of being alone or of the changes that come with a real breakup.  Staying *almost* in a relationship provides a comfort zone without the full commitment.
* **Fear of Hurting You (Ironically):** Some people avoid the finality of a breakup because they don't want to be the one to inflict pain. This is a backwards way of showing concern, as the continued ambiguity is *far* more painful in the long run.
* **Keeping Options Open:** He might be keeping you as a ""back burner"" option, wanting the comfort of knowing you're there without being willing to fully commit.  This is unfair to you.
* **Avoidance of Difficult Conversations:** Actually articulating *why* he's unhappy or what needs to change is hard. It's easier to just say ""I'm done"" and let the ambiguity linger.
* **Lack of Emotional Maturity:**  It takes maturity and courage to be honest and direct about feelings, even when they're difficult.  His behavior suggests a potential struggle with this.
* **He May Be Unsure of What *He* Wants:** He could be genuinely confused about his feelings, but *that's his problem to figure out, not yours to wait around for.*



**Why This Is So Damaging to *You***

* **Emotional Exhaustion:** Constantly questioning his feelings, interpreting his actions, and hoping for a different outcome is draining.  It’s like being in a perpetual state of anxiety.
* **Self-Worth:**  His actions are telling you, implicitly, that your feelings aren't important enough to warrant a clean break. This can erode your self-esteem. You deserve someone who values you enough to be honest.
* **Stalled Life:** You're likely putting your life on hold, waiting for him to ""decide"" while you're not truly living yours. You're not free to move forward, date others, or focus on your own happiness.
* **False Hope:**  The continued contact keeps the door open just enough to prevent you from fully grieving the relationship and moving on.  It's a cycle of hope and disappointment.
* **Anxiety and Insecurity:**  You're constantly walking on eggshells, analyzing every text, every visit, trying to decipher what it all means.

**What You Need to Do (Prioritizing *Your* Well-being)**

This is the hardest part, but it’s vital.  You need to take control of the situation, even though it feels like you have no power.

1. **Acknowledge the Reality:**  Stop believing his words *or* his actions. Believe what the *pattern* of behavior shows you: He's unwilling or unable to give you a clear, committed relationship.  The gap between his words and actions is the reality.

2. **Direct Communication (One Last Time, With Boundaries):**  This is a *very specific* conversation.  It's not about trying to fix things. It's about stating your needs and boundaries.  Here's a script idea (adjust to your own words):

   *""I need to talk to you about something important. For the past year, you've told me you're done, yet you continue to [list specific behaviors: text me, visit, etc.]. This is incredibly confusing and painful for me. I need clarity. I can't continue in this limbo. I need you to either commit to a future with me, with clear expectations, or to give me the space I need to move on.  I'm not asking you to change your feelings, but I *am* asking for honesty and respect. If you can't or won't do that, I need to protect myself and will have to create distance.""*

   **Important:**  Don't get drawn into a debate about his feelings. This isn't about *why* he feels the way he does. It's about your need for clarity and respect.",0.5178271532058716,0.01417898603270535,0.11122994652406416,0.2895839499970964

I also play on a team that I've hated since the beginning, and I finally want to quit before the season gets started. However, my parents say I can play on either both teams or neither. I think it's unfair because it's up to me if I want to play for a certain team. I was planning on playing basketball for the high school I get into, but if that means continuing to play for the team I hate, then I wouldn't want to play in high school. Now I don't know what to do! My parents are threatening to send me off to a different home if I don't play. I just want to run away.","The situation in your family seems to place unnecessary pressure on you.Are you and your parents able to talk together about their reason for their standard?Are your parents willing to listen to your reasons to not play on the team you hate?If yes, then maybe some type of compromise is possible for all of you to negotiate.If none of the above is possible, then you may want to get specific and direct advice from a professional, such as the school guidance counselor or psychologist, whom you'd trust and feel safe in talking.I hope you and your parents will find an answer that all of you are happy to accept.","Okay, this is a *really* tough situation, and it's completely understandable why you're feeling overwhelmed and wanting to run away. It sounds like a lot of pressure is being piled onto you, and it's impacting something you genuinely love. Let's break this down, and then talk about resources to help you.  This is a multi-layered problem, and we'll address it that way.

**1. Understanding the Core Issues**

* **Control & Autonomy:** You feel like your parents are taking away your agency. You deserve to have a say in how you spend your time and what activities you participate in, especially when it comes to something you're passionate about.  Their ""both or nothing"" rule feels controlling.
* **Enjoyment vs. Obligation:** Basketball should be fun. You clearly enjoy playing on your school team, but this other team is causing you distress.  Forcing yourself to do something you hate, even if it's tied to something you love, is a recipe for burnout and resentment.
* **High Stakes and Future Implications:**  The pressure of private school applications *combined* with this basketball issue is a lot.  You're rightfully worried that this situation could affect your enjoyment of basketball in high school, and that's a valid concern.
* **Emotional Abuse/Manipulation:**  The threat of being sent to a different home is *extremely* serious.  That sounds like emotional manipulation and is not a healthy way for parents to address a disagreement.  This is not about basketball anymore; it's about control and power dynamics.
* **Feeling Trapped:** You feel like you have no good options, and that's a terrifying feeling.



**2.  Addressing the Basketball Situation (Even Though It's Secondary Right Now)**

While the bigger issue is with your parents, let’s touch on the basketball piece. You are absolutely right to want to quit a team you hate.  There's nothing wrong with prioritizing your mental and emotional wellbeing. 

* **The ""Why"" for your parents (before anything else):** If you could, *calmly* (even writing it down is okay) explain to your parents *specifically* why you dislike the team. Is it the coach? The other players? The overall environment?  Avoid just saying ""I hate it."" Be factual. (""The coach consistently yells at players in a way that makes me feel anxious,"" or ""There's a lot of negativity and drama on the team."")  They might not understand the depth of your feelings without specifics.  *However*, given their reaction so far, this may not be effective, and that's okay.  Don’t push it if it escalates things.

* **Focus on School Team:** Emphasize how much you value the school team and how it contributes positively to your life. Explain that continuing with the other team could negatively affect your energy and focus for the school team.



**3.  The *Critical* Issue: Your Parents' Behavior**

The threat to send you to another home is deeply concerning. This is **not okay**.  This is a form of emotional abuse and control.  Here’s where you need to prioritize your safety and well-being.

* **You are not responsible for your parents' reaction.** Their threat is *their* choice, not a consequence of your decision about basketball.  You are allowed to have your own feelings and make your own choices.
* **You deserve to be treated with respect.** A healthy parent-child relationship involves communication, compromise, and mutual respect – not threats and ultimatums.

**4.  What To Do – Resources and Actions**

This is where things get serious. You need to reach out for help.  **Do NOT go through this alone.**  Here are some options, and I'm listing them in order of immediacy:

* **Trusted Adult – Immediately:**  This is the most important step. Talk to a trusted adult *right now*.  This could be:
    * **A school counselor:**  They are trained to deal with these kinds of situations and can offer support and guidance. They also have a duty to report if they believe you are in a dangerous situation.
    * **Another relative:**  Aunt, uncle, grandparent, older sibling - anyone you trust and feel safe talking to.
    * **A teacher:** Someone you have a good relationship with.
    * **A coach:**  Your school basketball coach might be a good person to talk to, as they may have experience with family dynamics.
* **National Runaway Safeline:**  1-800-RUNAWAY (1-800-786-2929).  https://www.1800runaway.org/  Even though you don’t want to run away, they can provide crisis support,",0.5058329105377197,0.01099424496379045,0.10913404507710557,0.2394048132441476
"Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes  I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I can't get it out.  How can I stop these thoughts?","Hi there,I first want to let you know that having these thoughts is completely normal. Studies have been done that show that 80% of human thoughts are ""negative"" so you are not alone. I like to think of thoughts as a tornado... if you are in a tornado, you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial. However, when you are, let's say, a mile away from a tornado, it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as get shelter or make sure your family and friends are safe. When unhelpful or scary thoughts arise, we tend to start a ""war"" with them, which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado. This makes the thoughts and emotions bigger and intensifies the feelings that go with them. So the question I imagine you have is ""how do I get out of the tornado?"" There are 3 steps to doing this:Get distance from your thoughts by adding ""I am noticing I'm having the thought that...."" to the front of them. For example, ""I am noticing I am having the thought that something bad is going to happen to me.""   The purpose of this is not to decrease your fear or get rid of the thought. These thoughts might always be there and that is okay because that is how the mind naturally works so struggling with that is a waste of time and energy. The purpose is to gain some distance from the thoughts so you don't get swept away by them. You can imagine them floating along like leaves in a stream or clouds in the sky (and often the same thought will come back again and again but that's okay... just continue to notice it with curiosity). I imagine the thoughts get in your way of doing what really matters to you so if you can get a little bit of distance, you can do things that are fulfilling and meaningful to you. Tune into your body and notice what sensations come up and where you feel them most intensely. Then breathe into them and make room for them. Our 5 main emotions are: joy, sadness, fear/anxiety, shame, and anger. ALL of these emotions are part of being human and there is no escaping them. So again, struggling with them ends up intensifying them. Instead, let them be and make a little bit of room for them. Often a side effect of this is the intensity will decrease but it might not. The purpose is to keep them from becoming more intense. Contact the present moment. Notice what is happening here and now. One way of doing this is tuning into the five senses. What are some things you hear, see, taste, smell, and feel? Another way is to notice what is happening in your body (without trying to change it). How deep are your breaths, what is happening with your heart rate, are you cold/warm, etc?Implementing these three steps can help you to refrain from getting caught up in your unhelpful thoughts. Unfortunately there is no way to get rid of thoughts or feelings completely. So the only option that works in the long run is to accept them while continuing to do what matters to you and what is fulfilling to you.I hope this helps!","Okay, this is really common, and it's good you're reaching out and wanting to address it. It sounds like you're experiencing what's often called ""intrusive thoughts"" - unwanted, often distressing thoughts that pop into your head and feel hard to control.  Here's a breakdown of how to understand them, and a lot of strategies to help you stop them, ranging from things you can do *in the moment* to longer-term practices.  I'll also include when it's important to seek professional help.  This is a long response, because it's a complex issue, but I want to be thorough.

**1. Understanding What's Happening: It's Not About *Wanting* the Thought**

* **Intrusive Thoughts are Normal:**  Seriously.  *Everyone* has weird, scary, or disturbing thoughts sometimes.  The difference isn't that you're ""wrong"" for having them, but that you're *reacting* to them in a way that's causing distress.
* **Content Doesn't Matter as Much as Reaction:**  The *content* of the thought (e.g., something bad happening to you, harming someone, a disturbing image) is less important than your *reaction* to it.  The more you try to suppress the thought, the stronger it often becomes.
* **Anxiety Amplifier:** Anxiety is a huge driver of intrusive thoughts. When you're stressed or anxious, your brain is more prone to searching for potential threats, and that can manifest as these scary scenarios.
* **Not a Reflection of Your Character:**  Having a scary thought doesn't mean you *want* that thing to happen, or that you're a bad person.  Your thoughts aren't commands.  They are just thoughts.
* **The ""Thought Loop"":** You describe this perfectly – the thought gets stuck. This happens because your brain perceives the thought as important (because you're reacting to it strongly) and keeps bringing it up to ""solve"" it.



**2. Immediate Techniques: What to Do *When* a Scary Thought Pops Up**

These are about interrupting the loop *in the moment*.

* **Label it as an Intrusive Thought:**  Say to yourself (even silently), ""This is an intrusive thought.""  Just naming it can take some of its power away.  ""There's my brain being anxious again.""  ""This is just a thought, not a reality.""
* **Thought Defusion Techniques:** These aim to create distance between you and the thought.
    * **""I'm Having the Thought That...""**  Instead of ""Something bad is going to happen,"" say, ""I'm having the thought that something bad is going to happen.""  This little shift creates distance.
    * **Say it Silly:**  Repeat the thought over and over, faster and faster, in a cartoonish voice.  It sounds ridiculous, and that can break the cycle.
    * **Thank Your Brain:**  (This sounds weird, but it works for some!) ""Thank you, brain, for trying to protect me. But I don't need this thought right now."" Acknowledges the anxiety without engaging with the content.
* **Mindfulness/Grounding:**  Bring your attention to the present moment.
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Name 5 things you can *see*, 4 things you can *touch*, 3 things you can *hear*, 2 things you can *smell*, and 1 thing you can *taste*.
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths.  Try box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4).
    * **Focus on Physical Sensations:**  Feel your feet on the ground, the weight of your body in a chair, the texture of your clothes.
* **Distraction (Use with Caution):** While not a long-term solution, distraction can give you a break.  Listen to music, watch a funny video, call a friend, do a puzzle, engage in a hobby. *Don't* use unhealthy distractions (like excessive scrolling or substance use).  The goal is a temporary respite, not avoidance.
* **Acceptance (This is hard!):**  Instead of fighting the thought, try to *accept* that it's there.  This doesn't mean you *like* it, but you're not resisting it.  Think of it like a wave – it rises, crests, and falls.  You can observe it without being swept away.  (This is a core principle of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy – see section 4).




**3. Longer-Term Strategies: Building Resilience**

"I started dating my fiancé two years ago. My first cousin is married to my fiancé’s sister. There has always been a communication issue between my uncle and aunt and my cousin and his wife. My uncle goes to my mom instead of talking to my cousin, and it upsets my mom.","Based on the information provided, this is an issue with boundaries.   Sounds like your uncle goes to your mom and possibly your mother takes the issues to you.  I do not like to assume so I will direct you to information regarding families dealing with enmeshment and triangulation.  Enmeshment is the concept of diffused boundaries in families and other personal relationships.  Triangulation is two individuals relaying information to a third party what cannot be said directly to each other.  From someone who has dealt with both these issues on a personal level, being informed about family dynamics is beneficial and can help you develop healthy boundaries for yourself within your family structure.  You may need assistance with developing healthy boundaries.  Although it is possible, it is not easy to change the way you have been operating for any extended amount of time.  Hope this help!","Okay, this is a complex family situation! It's good you're recognizing the dynamic and thinking about how it might impact things, especially with an upcoming marriage. Let's break down the issues and think about how to navigate this. Here's a detailed look, covering the core problems, potential impacts, and how you and your fiancé can approach this.

**Understanding the Core Issues**

* **Dysfunctional Communication Pattern:** The core problem is a long-standing pattern of indirect communication. Your uncle avoids direct conflict with your cousin by going *through* your mom. This is unhealthy and creates a lot of unnecessary stress and triangulation.
* **Burden on Your Mom:** Your mom is being put in a really unfair position. She's caught in the middle, forced to be a messenger or mediator in a dispute that isn't hers to solve.  It's understandable why this upsets her.
* **Impact on Family Events:** This dynamic likely makes family gatherings tense and uncomfortable. People might be walking on eggshells, and genuine connection is likely hindered.
* **Potential Spillover to Your Relationship:** Because of the family connections (you to your cousin, your fiancé to his sister), this pre-existing tension *can* absolutely spill over into your relationship and your future shared family life.



**Why This is Happening (Potential Reasons - Speculation, of course!)**

* **Conflict Avoidance:** Your uncle might be uncomfortable with direct confrontation.  He might fear escalating the conflict or believe he can't resolve it directly.
* **Power Dynamics:**  Sometimes, going through someone else can be a way to exert control or influence.
* **Past History:** There's likely a history that fuels this avoidance. Something happened in the past that made direct communication difficult.
* **Personality Differences:**  Sometimes people simply have different communication styles, and this can lead to breakdowns.



**How This Might Impact Your Relationship & Future**

* **Stress & Tension:**  Being caught in the middle of family drama is stressful for everyone. It could create tension between you and your fiancé if you have differing opinions on how to handle it.
* **Loyalty Conflicts:**  You and your fiancé might find yourselves feeling pulled in different directions, especially when it comes to supporting your respective family members.
* **Holidays & Events:** Family gatherings could become dreaded instead of enjoyable. This can be a huge strain on a marriage.
* **Potential for Interference:**  If the conflict escalates, it could lead to unwelcome interference in your relationship from either side of the family.
* **Boundaries being Crossed:**  People may feel entitled to offer unsolicited advice or take sides, blurring boundaries.

**What You and Your Fiancé Can Do (This is the most important part)**

This requires a united front.  You need to be on the same page. Here's a breakdown of strategies, ranging from more direct to more subtle:

**1. Establish Clear Boundaries (Together):** *This is the most critical step.*

* **With Your Uncle:** (This is primarily *your* responsibility, but your fiancé should be aware of your approach). Gently but firmly let your uncle know you are not a messenger.  Example: ""Uncle, I love you, but I'm really uncomfortable being put in the middle between you and [Cousin]. I'm happy to spend time with you, but I'm not going to relay messages.  You two really need to talk directly.""  Be prepared for him to push back, but hold your ground.  Repeat this as needed.  Don't engage in the content of the issue; focus *only* on your boundary.
* **With Your Mom:** Validate her feelings.  ""Mom, I'm so sorry you're getting put in this position. It's not fair to you.""  And *also* gently set a boundary for yourself:  ""I'm trying to stay out of the middle of this, so I won't be able to discuss it with you.""
* **With Your Fiancé’s Sister:**  Your fiancé should have a similar conversation with his sister.  She needs to understand that they aren’t willing to be drawn into the drama.
* **Between You and Your Fiancé:** Agree that you won't badmouth either family to each other. You'll support each other's boundaries.  This is a united front.

**2. Encourage Direct Communication (Gently):**

* **Your Uncle & Cousin:**  You (or your fiancé's sister) could say something like, ""It would be so much easier if you two could just talk directly about this. I know you both want what's best, and communicating directly would be a good step.""  *Don't* offer to mediate. Just suggest it.
* **Focus on the Positive:** Encourage family members to focus on shared",0.5065630674362183,2.921971124255737e-155,0.10123734533183353,0.22727272727272732
"In 2008 my former husband of 14 years walked away from my life and we've been separated ever since. We have always been together sexually and both have experienced sleeping with others. I stopped because I wanted my marriage to work out but he did not. If he stops sleeping with other women, can our marriage be saved? Or should we just part ways? I still care deeply about him after all that I did and he has done. But he is seeing someone else on and off for years now. Will our marriage still be saved if he decides that he wants to try to do so?","Sorry to hear about the stress in your relationship.  There is definite value in being clear as you are, about your own emotional investment in your husband and that you expect sexual exclusivity from him as part of the foundation of your marriage.Also positive is your awareness that only your husband is the one who must similarly decide his own standards of being sexually exclusive to you, or not.Whether your marriage can be saved depends on what each person is willing to accept about the other one.Is sleeping with other women the only criterion of what will satisfy you about being together with your husband?Love and care are not enough to make a marriage work. Partners need to be able to compromise and cooperate with each other. That you care for him definitely intensifies any emotion you feel toward your husband.  It intensifies any frustration and sadness about the relationship too.Decide how much emotional sadness and hurt you're willing to tolerate and the reason you're willing to do so.From what you write, you are being very generous of yourself and not being reciprocated for this.If your husband doesn't start taking steps toward satisfying your wishes, this may be your time to question your own generosity in waiting for him to do so.","Okay, this is a *very* complex situation with a lot of history. It's good you're asking these questions, as it shows you're trying to think through this thoughtfully. Here's a breakdown of the issues and a considered response, aiming to be realistic and supportive.  I'll cover the likelihood of saving the marriage, what needs to happen, and ultimately, whether it's a healthy path for *you*.  Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is not a substitute for professional advice.

**Can Your Marriage Be Saved If He Stops Sleeping With Other Women?**

The simple answer is: **potentially, but not *because* he stops sleeping with others.**  That's a *necessary* condition, but not *sufficient*.  Stopping the outside relationships is just the very first step, and it addresses a symptom, not the root cause.

The core issues here aren't just about the infidelity; they're about *why* it happened in the first place, and the fact that he walked away in 2008.  That initial abandonment is huge.  The ongoing ""on-again, off-again"" relationship with someone else for years is also deeply damaging and indicates a fundamental issue with his commitment.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

*   **The 2008 Walk-Away:** This is the foundational issue. Why did he leave? What needs to be resolved about that?  Simply returning *now* doesn't erase that period of absence or the pain it caused.  You need to understand his reasons then, and whether those reasons still exist.  This isn't about blaming; it's about understanding.
*   **The Ongoing Affairs/Relationships:**  The fact that this has been a pattern for years suggests a deeper problem.  Is it about unmet needs?  Is it about a fear of intimacy?  Is it about a lack of emotional maturity?  Is it about a fundamental dissatisfaction with the relationship dynamic?  If he simply stops seeing someone *for you*, but doesn't address the underlying reasons *why* he was seeking connection elsewhere, it will likely happen again.
*   **Your Own Feelings & Boundaries:** You stopped being intimate with others hoping to save the marriage, but he didn't reciprocate. That's a significant imbalance. You need to examine how that made you feel, and what your boundaries are *now*.  You sacrificed something, and he didn't meet you halfway.  This is important to acknowledge.
* **Your Care and His Actions:** You still care deeply, which is understandable after 14 years. But his actions have repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to prioritize his desires over the health and commitment of your marriage.  You need to weigh your feelings against his behavior.



**What Needs to Happen for *Any* Chance of Saving the Marriage?**

If you both *genuinely* want to try, here's what would be required.  This is a significant undertaking:

1.  **Radical Honesty & Accountability:** He needs to be brutally honest about *everything* – his reasons for leaving, his motivations for the other relationships, his current feelings for you and for the other person.  And, crucially, he needs to take full responsibility for his actions, without blaming you or making excuses.
2.  **Professional Counseling (Individual & Couples):** This is non-negotiable. You *both* need individual therapy to understand your own issues.  Then, you need couples therapy with a therapist experienced in infidelity and long-term relationship repair.  This isn't about ""fixing"" the marriage; it's about understanding the patterns and whether change is even possible.
3.  **Complete Cessation of Outside Relationships & Transparency:**  He must end *all* contact with the other person.  And he needs to be completely transparent with you about his life – access to phone, social media, etc. (This isn't about control; it's about rebuilding trust, which has been profoundly broken).
4.  **Addressing the Root Issues:**  The therapy needs to delve into the reasons *why* the marriage failed initially and why the infidelity continued.  What needs to change within each of you and within the dynamic of the relationship?
5.  **Time & Consistent Effort:**  Rebuilding trust takes *years*, not weeks or months.  There will be setbacks. It requires consistent, dedicated effort from both of you.
6. **Your Needs Acknowledged:** He needs to fully understand the impact of his actions on you and make genuine efforts to validate your feelings and address the pain he has caused.

**Should You Just Part Ways?**

This is the harder question. Here's how to think about it:

"I've been going through a rough time lately. I been into nothing but women. I’ve never thought about men until a week ago. I’m very upset and depressed about this. It's not normal to me. I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that I’m not gay. I get the same results each time, and I feel disgust. This is tough on me. I'm scared that I looked too many times. I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.","Are you able to give yourself some peace of mind while you take the time to further address whether or not you are gay?Whether or not and to what degree a person accepts their sexuality, depends on dense factors such as the culture of your family, the beliefs about gay people with which you were brought up, and your own tolerance for being a unique individual.Examining these factors, whether inwardly by yourself, in online blogs and sites, or live with other people, requires patience and effort.The more you are willing to commit to figuring out your own truth, the greater is your chance of finding it!","Okay, this sounds incredibly distressing, and it's brave of you to reach out and talk about it. It's understandable you're feeling upset, confused, and even scared right now. You're experiencing a lot of conflicting emotions, and it's important to address them with compassion and understanding, *especially* towards yourself.  Here's a breakdown of what you're describing, why it's happening, and what steps you can take to cope.  I'll try to be thorough, and I'll include resources at the end.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Sudden Attraction/Curiosity:** It's not uncommon for people to experience a shift in their attractions or to become aware of attractions they hadn't previously acknowledged.  Sexuality is often more fluid than we initially believe, and it can be influenced by many things – stress, life changes, emotional experiences, even just exposure to new ideas.  The fact that you've *never* thought about men before doesn't mean you *can't* experience attraction to them. It just means you haven't, until now.  This doesn't invalidate your past experiences or feelings.
* **Internalized Homophobia/Societal Expectations:**  The strong negative reaction you're having – the disgust, the feeling that it's ""not normal"" –  suggests you've internalized some negative beliefs about same-sex attraction. These beliefs often come from societal messages, religious teachings, or upbringing.  These messages can be incredibly powerful and can create significant internal conflict.  It's *okay* to challenge these beliefs.  ""Normal"" is a very broad term, and human sexuality exists on a spectrum.
* **The Pornography Loop & Anxiety:**  Using pornography to ""prove"" your sexuality is a very common, but often *unhelpful* and even *harmful* response.  It's not a reliable way to determine your orientation. In fact, it can often increase anxiety and guilt, especially when it clashes with your internal beliefs.  The fact that you feel disgust *after* viewing it actually reinforces the conflict you're experiencing.  You're essentially forcing yourself to have an experience you're not comfortable with, then punishing yourself for it.  The more you fixate on it, the more anxious you become, creating a vicious cycle.
* **The Shaking & Depression:** The intense anxiety and internal conflict you're feeling are manifesting physically (shaking) and emotionally (depression). This is a sign that your mental health is being significantly affected.  Ignoring these feelings will likely make them worse.



**Why You're Likely *Not* ""Turning"" Gay (and it doesn't matter if you are)**

It sounds like you're terrified of being gay.  Let's address that directly. Even if these feelings *do* lead to you identifying as something other than exclusively heterosexual, that is *not* a bad thing. Your worth as a person doesn't change based on who you're attracted to.  However, what's happening to you right now suggests this is more about your *reaction* to the possibility of same-sex attraction, rather than the attraction itself.

Here's why the pornography experiment isn't valid:

* **Pornography is not real life:** It's a highly stylized and often unrealistic representation of sex. It doesn't accurately reflect genuine emotional connection or attraction.
* **Coercion & Anxiety:** You were viewing it with the *intention* of feeling disgust, which means you weren't allowing yourself to experience anything authentically. You were looking for confirmation of a negative belief.
* **Curiosity vs. Attraction:**  It's possible to be curious about something without being attracted to it.  Your initial exploration might have simply been a response to the *newness* of the thought.

**What You Can Do Now**

1. **Stop the Pornography:** Immediately.  It's fueling your anxiety and guilt.  There's nothing to prove.
2. **Self-Compassion:** This is crucial.  Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend going through a similar struggle.  Acknowledge your feelings without judgment.  It's okay to be confused, scared, and upset.  Say things to yourself like, ""This is difficult, and it's okay that I'm struggling,"" or ""I'm allowed to feel whatever I'm feeling.""
3. **Challenge Negative Thoughts:**  Identify the negative beliefs you have about homosexuality. Where did they come from? Are they based on facts, or on fear and prejudice?  Actively question these beliefs.  
4. **Focus on Your Feelings, Not Labels:**  Instead of trying to categorize yourself, focus on understanding your *feelings*. What specifically is upsetting you? Is it",0.501022458076477,2.142336321622407e-155,0.09330143540669858,0.22208513263417648
I blame my past relationship for it. I know it is bad to be this way. I want to get past it.,"We humans are social beings. We learn how to BE in relationship as children. The caregiving you received (or didn't receive) set the stage for how you show up in all your adult relationships. Insecurity in relationships often has much to do with feeling unheard or unseen, perhaps feeling like you don't matter. There are many ways to rewire these relational patterns, the first step of which is taking pause and noticing that you are feeling insecure - so congrats on that because clearly you are already there!  Next I'd suggest finding a relationship therapist to help you sort through your insecurities, either as a couple or individually. ","Okay, it's really good that you recognize this and *want* to get past it. That's the biggest first step, and honestly, a really important one. It's completely understandable to be affected by a past relationship, especially if it was difficult.  It's *not* bad to feel the way you do – it's a natural human response to pain and trauma. Blaming it on the past relationship is also a natural starting point, but as you already know, staying stuck in that blame won't help you move forward.

Let's break this down.  You've said a lot with just a few sentences, so let's unpack it.  To help me offer more tailored support, could you tell me a little more about **what ""it"" is**?  Without knowing what you're struggling with, it's hard to give specific advice.  Is it:

* **Difficulty trusting people?**
* **Fear of intimacy?**
* **Low self-esteem?**
* **Anxiety about relationships?**
* **Negative patterns in your current behavior?** (e.g., pushing people away, being overly critical)
* **Something else entirely?**

Even a general idea helps.

In the meantime, here are some general thoughts and things to consider, based on the fact you *want* to move past this:

**1. Validating Your Feelings:**

* **It's okay to grieve.** Even if the relationship ended a long time ago, you're allowed to feel sad, angry, hurt, or confused. Don't try to suppress those feelings.
* **Your feelings are valid.**  Whatever happened in that relationship likely *did* impact you.  Don't minimize your experience.
* **You're not alone.** Many, many people struggle with the aftermath of a difficult relationship.

**2. Shifting from Blame to Understanding:**

* **Blame keeps you stuck.** While it's true the past relationship contributed, focusing solely on blame prevents you from taking control of your own healing.
* **What did you *learn*?** Can you identify any patterns – in yourself or in the relationship – that you want to avoid in the future?  This isn't about finding fault, but about gaining insight.
* **What needs did *you* have that weren't met?**  Sometimes, focusing on what *you* wanted and didn't get can be empowering.

**3.  Taking Action to Heal (Things you can start doing *now*):**

* **Self-Compassion:** Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend going through a similar situation. This is HUGE.
* **Self-Care:**  Prioritize activities that nourish your well-being – things you enjoy, things that relax you, things that make you feel good about yourself.  This could be anything from taking a bath to exercising to spending time in nature.
* **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a powerful way to process them.
* **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  These practices can help you stay grounded in the present moment and manage difficult emotions.
* **Set Boundaries:**  Learn to say ""no"" to things you don't want to do, and to protect your emotional energy.
* **Focus on the Present:**  While it's important to acknowledge the past, don't let it define your future.  Focus on building a life you love *now*.

**4.  Considering Professional Support:**

* **Therapy:** A therapist can provide a safe and supportive space to explore your feelings, identify unhealthy patterns, and develop coping mechanisms.  This is often the most effective way to work through the aftermath of a difficult relationship.  (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - CBT - can be particularly helpful).
* **Support Groups:** Connecting with others who have similar experiences can be incredibly validating and empowering.

"I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.
 I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. While your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard. Talk to them during a non-emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as ""you NEVER listen,"" ""you ALWAYS say..."" and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with ""you"" try using ""I"" by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist, teacher, or school counselor if possible. Most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help.Best of luck to you.","Okay, this sounds incredibly painful, and you're showing a lot of strength even *recognizing* all of this and reaching out (even just by writing it down, that's a huge step). It's completely understandable to feel lost and overwhelmed when you're carrying this much weight, especially as a teenager. Let's break down what you've shared and explore some potential paths forward.

**First, validating your feelings:**

* **It's okay to love your parents and dislike their personalities.** These are separate things. You can have affection for them as your parents without needing to *like* who they are as people.
* **Being dismissed is deeply invalidating.**  The feeling that your serious concerns aren't taken seriously, especially by parents, is incredibly damaging. It erodes trust and makes you feel alone. Your feelings are valid, and you deserve to be heard.  The ""tag-team"" approach of your parents is particularly hurtful - it feels like a united front *against* you, not *for* you.
* **Your experience with depression is significant.**  You *fought* and *won* a battle with depression. That's a massive accomplishment, and it speaks to your resilience. It's also likely that overcoming depression leaves you more sensitive to stress and anxiety.
* **It's fair to want reciprocal support from your friends.**  You're a good friend to *them*, and it's reasonable to expect them to be there for you when you need it too. It's exhausting to always be the supporter and never the supported.
* **The feeling of a lost childhood is real.** When foundational relationships are shaky and you don't feel safe being yourself, it absolutely can feel like you missed out on important parts of growing up.
* **Feeling like you have no one to trust is a terrifying place to be.** You're not alone in feeling this way, but it's crucial to address it.



**Let's look at each area and potential strategies.  I'll also add a *very important disclaimer* at the end.**

**1. Parents & Communication:**

This is the toughest one. Since their pattern is established, dramatically changing it might not be possible.  Focus on managing *your* expectations and reactions:

* **Lower Expectations:**  This is hard, but accepting that they may not *be able* to give you the emotional support you need can be freeing.  It doesn't mean you stop trying to communicate, but it means you brace yourself for potential disappointment.
* **""Information Sharing,"" Not ""Emotional Processing"":**  Instead of going to them to *process* your feelings (which seems to backfire), try framing conversations as simply sharing information.  ""I wanted to let you know I'm feeling really stressed about school.""  This might avoid triggering their dismissive response.
* **Focus on Facts:**  When talking about something serious, stick to concrete facts and avoid emotional language.  This can sometimes make it harder for them to dismiss what you're saying.
* **Grey Rock Method:** (Look this up online, it's a communication technique) If they become dismissive, offer minimal engagement.  Short, neutral responses.  Don't get drawn into arguments.  Protect your energy.
* **Acceptance (not approval):** You don’t need their approval to be valid. You need to accept yourself.
* **Regarding your sexuality:**  Coming out to parents who aren't supportive can be incredibly risky. *You are not obligated to come out to them if you don't feel safe.*  Your safety and well-being are paramount.



**2. Friends & Support:**

* **Honest Conversation (with chosen friends):**  Choose one or two friends you feel closest to and have a vulnerable conversation.  Something like, ""Hey, I really appreciate you always being there for me, and I try to be there for you too.  Lately, I've been really struggling with [stress/anxiety/feeling unsupported] and it would mean a lot if I could lean on you sometimes.""  Be specific about what you need.
* **Recognize Different Styles:**  Some people are naturally better at offering emotional support than others.  Your friends might show their care in different ways (e.g., acts of service, spending time together).
* **Expand Your Support Network:**  Are there other adults you trust – a teacher, counselor, coach, relative?  Sometimes, a different perspective can be helpful.
* **Boundaries:** It's okay to set boundaries with friends.  You can't pour from an empty cup.  If you're constantly supporting them and getting nothing in return, you need to protect your own energy.  This might mean saying ""I'm really overwhelmed right now, I can't really be there for",0.5357406139373779,0.014483401172936028,0.142433234421365,0.32814872555888663
"I think adult life is making him depressed and we often sleep in on weekends untill 1 or 2 pm. We just eat, smoke weed, watch movies, and he'll go on his phone all day. He doesn't seem motivated to do much and he's often angry.
    I have no clue how to help him take his mind off the negative, or to distract him into a different light. How do I help him?",How do you help yourself to believe you require more than what he offers to you?What do you get from this relationship which feels satisfying?To answer this question may in the longterm be the best way to help your bf.,"Okay, this sounds really tough, and you're a good partner for wanting to help. It's understandable why you're concerned – the pattern you describe is often associated with depression, and the anger is a common symptom.  It's great you're recognizing this and wanting to support him. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering things to understand, things to *try*, and important boundaries.  I'll also include a *very important disclaimer* at the end.

**1. Understanding What Might Be Going On**

* **Depression is More Than Sadness:** It's not just feeling down. It's a complex illness that can manifest as loss of interest in things he used to enjoy (anhedonia), fatigue, changes in sleep and appetite, irritability/anger, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of hopelessness.  The things you're describing align with that.
* **Weed as Coping:** While it might seem like it's just recreational, frequent weed use can sometimes be a way to self-medicate and *mask* underlying issues. It can also worsen depression and anxiety in the long run, creating a cycle.
* **The Cycle of Demotivation:**  When someone is depressed, it's incredibly hard to *find* motivation. It's not a matter of just ""trying harder.""  The lack of activity then reinforces the negative feelings, creating a downward spiral.
* **Adulting is Hard:** You specifically mentioned adult life.  The pressures of work, finances, responsibilities, and future planning can be incredibly overwhelming and contribute to depression.
* **Anger as Masked Pain:** Anger is often a secondary emotion. It can be a way to cover up feelings of sadness, vulnerability, or helplessness.



**2. What You Can *Try* (Approaches & Suggestions)**

* **Gentle Conversation (Timing is Key):** *Do not* try to have this conversation when he's already angry or deeply engrossed in an activity.  Choose a calm moment, perhaps when you're both relaxed (though not necessarily *in* the middle of the pattern).  Start by expressing your *concern*, not accusations.  Example:  ""I've noticed you haven't been yourself lately, and I'm worried about you. I've noticed we've been sleeping in a lot, and you seem frustrated a lot of the time. I want to understand what's going on.""  *Avoid* phrases like ""You *always*..."" or ""You *need* to...""
* **""I"" Statements:** Focus on how *you* feel.  ""I miss doing things with you,"" instead of ""You never want to do anything.""  ""I worry when I see you isolating yourself,"" instead of ""You're isolating yourself.""
* **Suggest Small, Achievable Activities:**  Don't suggest a huge life overhaul. Start ridiculously small.  Examples:
    * ""Want to go for a 10-minute walk around the block with me?""
    * ""How about we make a healthy breakfast together tomorrow?""
    * ""There's a new movie I've been wanting to see; maybe we could check it out?""
    * ""I was thinking of doing [a simple hobby] for 30 minutes. Want to join?""
    *  The goal isn’t to force fun, but to break the cycle of inactivity.
* **Focus on Shared Positive Experiences:**  What did you *both* enjoy doing together before?  Can you revisit those activities, even in a modified way?
* **Suggest a Different Evening Routine:** Instead of immediately reaching for the weed and movies, suggest something different *once in a while*. Board game?  Listening to music?  Cooking a meal? A relaxing bath?
* **Lead by Example:**  Model healthy behaviors yourself.  If you want him to be more active, show him you're engaging in activities you enjoy.
* **Be Patient:**  Change takes time, especially when dealing with depression.  There will be setbacks.  Don't get discouraged.
* **Validate His Feelings:**  Even if you don't understand *why* he's feeling a certain way, acknowledge that his feelings are valid.  ""That sounds really frustrating,"" or ""It makes sense that you'd be feeling down.""



**3. Important Boundaries & Self-Care**

* **You Are Not His Therapist:** You are his partner, and you can offer support, but you are not equipped to *treat* depression. Trying to take on that role will be exhausting and ultimately unhelpful.
* **Don't Enable:**  While you want to be supportive, you don’t want to inadvertently enable the unhealthy patterns.  Constantly accommodating the sleeping in, the weed use, and the isolation will likely make things worse",0.4166792333126068,1.6389267257648404e-155,0.04864864864864865,0.14680874573183383
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",There is no such thing as too many issues for counseling. Many issues are often interrelated and can all be worked on with some time and patience.,"Okay, that is a *lot* to carry, and it's incredibly brave of you to even acknowledge it all, let alone ask this question.  It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when facing this depth of experience.  And you are absolutely not alone in having multiple, complex issues.

**To directly answer your question: No, you absolutely do *not* have too many issues to address in counseling.**  That's a myth.  In fact, it's incredibly *common* for people to present with multiple, interwoven challenges like yours.  A good therapist will be equipped to handle that complexity.

Here's a breakdown of why, and how a therapist would approach this, plus things to consider:

**Why it's *not* too much:**

* **Interconnectedness:** Your experiences aren't isolated. The sexual abuse likely impacts your self-esteem, your anxiety, and potentially even your insomnia.  The cancer experience is traumatic and can contribute to anxiety and depression.  The long-term insomnia exacerbates everything.  A skilled therapist understands these connections and won't treat things in a vacuum.
* **Therapists are trained for this:**  Therapists, especially those specializing in trauma, mood disorders, or even long-term health issues, are trained to work with complexity.  They use techniques that can address multiple issues simultaneously, or prioritize based on what's most impacting your life *right now*.
* **Your 35-year marriage is a strength:** This is HUGE. Having a stable, loving relationship is a massive protective factor and resource. It’s not something to minimize. A therapist can even explore how your marriage has supported you, and how you can further lean on that support.
* **It's about *your* pace:**  You don't have to unpack everything on day one (or even month one!).  Therapy is a process, and you control the pace. You and your therapist will work together to determine what feels safe and manageable to address at any given time.



**How a therapist might approach this (likely phases):**

1. **Building Safety & Trust (Early Sessions):**  The first few sessions will likely focus on building a rapport with the therapist and establishing a safe space.  You'll discuss your goals for therapy and what you hope to achieve.  *You* lead this part; you decide what you're comfortable sharing.
2. **Stabilization and Coping Skills:**  Given your anxiety and insomnia, the therapist might initially focus on teaching you coping mechanisms to manage those symptoms *first*. This could include relaxation techniques, mindfulness, sleep hygiene strategies, or grounding exercises.  This creates a foundation of self-regulation.
3. **Trauma Processing (when *you're* ready):**  Addressing the sexual abuse will likely be a significant part of the work, *but it will be done at your pace*.  There are many evidence-based therapies for trauma (EMDR, Trauma-Focused CBT, Somatic Experiencing, etc.).  The therapist will explain these options and help you choose what feels right. **It's crucial this is a trauma-informed therapist.**
4. **Addressing Depression & Self-Esteem:**  As you process the trauma and develop coping skills, the therapy will likely shift towards addressing the underlying depression and low self-esteem.  This might involve exploring negative thought patterns, challenging self-criticism, and building self-compassion.
5. **Integrating and Moving Forward:**  The final phase involves consolidating your gains, developing a relapse prevention plan, and focusing on building a fulfilling life.  Your marriage will likely be a central part of this.

**Important Considerations When Choosing a Therapist:**

* **Trauma-Informed Care:**  *Absolutely essential*. This means the therapist understands the impact of trauma and will approach your experiences with sensitivity and respect.  Ask potential therapists about their training in trauma-informed care.
* **Experience with Complex Trauma:**  Look for someone who has experience working with individuals who have multiple, overlapping traumas.
* **Experience with Cancer Survivors:** While not essential, a therapist who understands the emotional and psychological impact of cancer can be incredibly helpful.
* **Therapeutic Approach:**  Different therapists use different approaches.  Research options like EMDR, CBT, psychodynamic therapy, etc., and see what resonates with you.  Many offer a brief initial consultation to discuss their approach.
* **Your Comfort Level:**  This is the most important thing.  You need to feel safe, comfortable, and understood by your therapist.  Don't be afraid to ""shop around"" until you find someone you connect with.



**Where to find a therapist:**

* **Psychology Today:**  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us)  (Has a searchable directory)",0.4441676139831543,2.704580336677455e-79,0.040106951871657755,0.1259583789704272

My fiancé and I broke up. He cheated on me numerous times. I kept forgiving but questioning his every move. He got tired and left.,if he as cheated on you multiple times it is not healthy for you to continue seeing him.  However It takes time to heal your pain. You are not a robot that can just switch off your emotions.  Please surround yourself with people who can support and empower you. ,"Okay, this is incredibly painful, and I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's a really tough situation, and it sounds like you've been carrying a lot of emotional weight for a long time. It's understandable to feel a whole range of emotions right now – sadness, anger, betrayal, relief, confusion... all of it is valid.

Let's break down what you've shared and talk about some things that might help.  It sounds like there's a cycle of hurt and forgiveness that finally led to this ending, and it's important to acknowledge all parts of that.

**Here's what stands out to me, and why it's important to address:**

* **Repeated Infidelity:**  The fact that the cheating wasn't a one-time mistake but *numerous* times is incredibly damaging. It's a fundamental breach of trust.
* **Your Forgiveness:** You are a very forgiving person.  That's a strength, but it seems in this situation, it came at the cost of your own emotional well-being. Forgiveness is good *for you* when *you* are ready, and it's about your healing, not about giving someone else a pass.
* **Your Questioning:**  The constant need to check on him, to question his actions, is a very natural response to being betrayed. It's a form of self-protection, born out of fear of being hurt again.  However, it's also exhausting and unhealthy to live in that state of constant vigilance.  It's a sign that trust was irrevocably broken.
* **His ""Tiredness"" and Leaving:** While his leaving isn't a justification for his actions, it *does* highlight the dynamic. He got tired of the consequences of *his* actions, and instead of taking responsibility and working to rebuild trust (which is incredibly hard and requires consistent effort), he chose to leave. This speaks volumes about his character and his willingness to truly commit to a healthy relationship.
* **The Cycle:** You were caught in a cycle. He breaks trust, you forgive (and understandably struggle to trust again), he feels pressured, and the cycle repeats.  Recognizing this cycle is the first step to breaking it.



**Right now, here's what I suggest focusing on (and it's okay to take these at your own pace):**

1. **Allow Yourself to Grieve:**  Even if you knew this was coming, even if you feel relieved, this is a loss.  Allow yourself to feel the sadness, anger, and disappointment.  Don't suppress your emotions.  Cry if you need to. Scream into a pillow. Journal.  Let it out.

2. **No Contact (Seriously):** This is *crucial*.  I know it's hard, but you need space to heal.  No texting, calling, social media stalking, asking mutual friends about him… nothing.  Every contact, even seemingly innocent ones, will pull you back into the cycle and hinder your healing.  Unfollow, block if necessary.  This is about protecting *you*.

3. **Focus on Self-Care:**  This isn't about bubble baths (though those are nice too!). This is about actively nurturing yourself.  What makes *you* feel good?  What brings you joy?  It could be:
    * **Physical Health:**  Exercise, healthy eating, getting enough sleep.
    * **Emotional Health:**  Spending time with supportive friends and family, journaling, meditation, mindfulness.
    * **Hobbies:**  Rediscover old passions or explore new ones.
    * **Boundaries:**  Start setting healthy boundaries in *all* areas of your life. This is a great practice for future relationships.

4. **Challenge the Forgiveness Pattern:**  It’s wonderful that you are a forgiving person, but you need to understand that forgiveness should not be automatic, and it doesn’t mean you should tolerate repeated harmful behavior.  Reflect on *why* you kept forgiving.  Was it fear of being alone?  A belief you could ""fix"" him?  Low self-worth?  Understanding your motivations will help you make different choices in the future.

5. **Therapy (Highly Recommended):**  A therapist can provide a safe and supportive space to process your emotions, understand the dynamics of the relationship, and develop healthy coping mechanisms.  They can help you rebuild your self-esteem and learn to recognize red flags in future relationships.  Look for a therapist specializing in relationship trauma or betrayal trauma.

6. **Rebuild Your Trust (In Yourself):**  The cheating has likely shaken your trust not only in him but in your own judgment.  Start small.  Keep promises to yourself.  Trust your intuition.  Rebuilding trust takes time, but it's",0.46123790740966797,2.1101706592430543e-155,0.05950840879689522,0.17917257351485116
"I have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.","Something to remember about anxiety is that it's a useful and necessary response to stressors, and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming. Anxiety is our brain's way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action. Some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. The first I'd recommend is a calm breathing technique - breathe in for 4-5 seconds, and then out for 7-8 seconds. Try to repeat this for 3-5 minutes. Another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe - without judging - the sensations to yourself. Try to be very specific, such as ""my palms are feeling very sweaty, and I can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies."" Then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad - just experiencing them as intentionally as possible.  Combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful. If you feel that these techniques don't help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to, then I'd highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional. This professional can help you determine if therapy/counseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms.","Okay, it's incredibly common to feel anxious about those things! You're definitely not alone. Finances, work, relationships, kids, and household upkeep are *huge* sources of stress for most people. It's good you're recognizing this and wanting to address it.  Here's a breakdown of how to approach these anxieties, covering understanding, coping strategies, and when to seek professional help.  I'll try to be thorough, so this is a long response, but hopefully helpful.  I'll categorize it into sections: Understanding Your Anxiety, Immediate Coping Techniques, Longer-Term Strategies, and When to Seek Professional Help.

**1. Understanding Your Anxiety**

* **Normal vs. Problematic Anxiety:**  It's normal to experience anxiety when facing real-life stressors.  It's actually a helpful signal that something needs your attention.  *Problematic* anxiety is when it's disproportionate to the situation, persistent, interferes with your daily life, and/or causes significant distress.  Think about how much these anxieties are impacting your ability to function.
* **The Anxiety Cycle:**  Understanding how anxiety works can be empowering.  It often goes like this:
    * **Trigger:** A stressor (bill arrives, work deadline, argument with a partner).
    * **Thought:**  Negative or catastrophic thoughts (""I'll never be able to pay this,"" ""I'm going to get fired,"" ""My relationship is doomed"").
    * **Physical Symptoms:**  Racing heart, sweating, muscle tension, shortness of breath, stomach upset.
    * **Behavior:**  Avoidance, reassurance-seeking, procrastination, irritability.  This avoidance often reinforces the anxiety.
* **Identify Your Specific Fears:**  Within each stressor category (finances, work, etc.), what *specifically* are you afraid of?  For example:
    * **Finances:**  ""I'm afraid of becoming homeless,"" ""I'm afraid of not being able to provide for my kids,"" ""I'm afraid of debt.""
    * **Work:** ""I'm afraid of failing,"" ""I'm afraid of being judged,"" ""I'm afraid of losing my job.""
    * **Relationships:** ""I'm afraid of being abandoned,"" ""I'm afraid of conflict,"" ""I'm afraid of not being good enough.""
    * **Kids:** ""I'm afraid they'll get hurt,"" ""I'm afraid I'm not a good parent,"" ""I'm afraid of their future.""
    * **Household:** ""I'm afraid of the house falling into disrepair,"" ""I'm afraid of being overwhelmed by chores,"" ""I'm afraid of not having a clean/organized home.""
    * **Writing these down is *really* helpful.** It makes them less vague and more manageable.



**2. Immediate Coping Techniques (In the Moment)**

These are things you can do *when* you're feeling anxious *right now*.

* **Deep Breathing:**  This is a classic for a reason.  Try box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4).  Focusing on your breath shifts your attention away from anxious thoughts.
* **Grounding Techniques:**  Bring yourself back to the present moment.
    * **5-4-3-2-1:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Sensory Focus:**  Hold an ice cube, feel the texture of something nearby, listen to calming music.
* **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR):**  Tense and release different muscle groups in your body.  There are guided PMR recordings available online.
* **Mindful Awareness:**  Observe your thoughts and feelings *without judgment*.  Acknowledge them (""I'm feeling anxious about finances right now""), but don't get carried away by them.  Imagine your thoughts as clouds passing by.
* **Short Walk/Movement:**  Physical activity releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects.  Even a 10-minute walk can help.
* **Distraction (Use sparingly):**  Sometimes, temporarily distracting yourself with a pleasant activity (reading, listening to music, watching a funny video) can give you a break from anxiety.  But don't rely on this as a long-term solution.



**3. Longer-Term Strategies (Building Resilience)**

These take time and effort, but they can significantly reduce your overall anxiety levels.

* **Problem-Solving:**  Identify the specific problem causing anxiety, brainstorm possible solutions, choose a solution, and take action.  Breaking down large problems into smaller steps",0.5311862230300903,6.354690241161723e-79,0.12307692307692308,0.28377920748225127
"I am a really shy person. I'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?","I can offer you hypnosis for confidence in presentations, via Skype, if you're in Cali.","Okay, it's *totally* understandable to feel stressed and less confident about presentations when you're naturally shy, especially in a demanding graduate program! You're definitely not alone. Here's a breakdown of strategies, categorized for how much effort they take, and focusing on building confidence specifically for presentations.  I'll also try to address the *why* behind the anxiety, because understanding that helps too.

**Understanding Your Shyness & Presentation Anxiety**

First, a little self-compassion. Shyness isn't a flaw; it's a temperament. It often stems from a heightened awareness of social judgment.  Presentation anxiety is a specific form of social anxiety, fueled by fears like:

* **Negative Evaluation:**  ""They'll think I'm stupid."" ""They'll notice I'm nervous.""
* **Making Mistakes:** ""I'll forget what to say."" ""I'll stumble over my words.""
* **Physical Symptoms:** ""My voice will shake."" ""I'll blush."" (Focusing on these *increases* them!)
* **Uncertainty:** Not knowing how the audience will react.



**I. Quick Wins (Low Effort - Things to Start *Immediately*)**

These are things you can do right before and during presentations to manage immediate anxiety.

* **Deep Breathing Exercises:**  Seriously.  Box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4) is amazing. Do it several times before you start, and even a couple of times *during* if you feel your anxiety rising (pause briefly between sentences to do so).  No one will notice.
* **Grounding Techniques:**  Feel your feet on the floor. Press your hands together.  Notice five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.  This pulls you into the present moment.
* **Positive Self-Talk (Micro-Level):**  Replace ""I'm going to mess this up"" with ""I'm prepared, and I can do this.""  Or even just, ""Okay, one slide at a time.""  Small, realistic affirmations.
* **Visualize Success:** Before your presentation, spend a few minutes imagining yourself delivering it confidently and smoothly.  Don't visualize perfection, visualize *handling* any stumbles gracefully.
* **Focus on Your Message, Not Yourself:**  Shift your attention from your nervousness to the value you're providing to the audience.  You have something important to share!
* **Eye Contact (Strategic):**  Don't try to make intense eye contact with everyone. Pick 2-3 friendly faces in the audience and rotate your gaze between them.  It feels more like a conversation.
* **Slow Down:**  Nervousness makes you rush. Consciously slow your speaking pace.  Pauses are *good*.  They give you time to think and the audience time to process.




**II.  Building Confidence (Medium Effort - Consistent Practice)**

These require more consistent effort but will have a bigger long-term impact.

* **Practice, Practice, Practice:** This is the biggest one.  But *how* you practice matters.
    * **Out Loud:**  Don't just read through your slides.  Deliver the presentation as if you're actually giving it.
    * **Record Yourself:**  Video is best, but audio is good too.  It's painful to watch/listen at first, but it's incredibly helpful to identify areas for improvement (pacing, filler words, body language).
    * **Practice in Front of a Mirror:**  Helps you become more aware of your nonverbal communication.
    * **Practice with Friends/Family:** Start with people you're comfortable with. Ask for constructive feedback.  Then, gradually expand to people you know less well.
    * **Practice Under Pressure (Simulate the Environment):**  Set a timer.  Have someone interrupt you with questions.  Practice in the room where you'll be presenting, if possible.
* **Know Your Material Inside and Out:** The better you understand your topic, the less likely you are to get flustered.  Anticipate potential questions.  Don't memorize your presentation word-for-word; focus on key concepts.
* **Structure Matters:** A well-organized presentation reduces anxiety.  Clear introduction, logical flow, strong conclusion.  Use visuals to support your points.
* **Reframe ""Mistakes"":**  Everyone makes mistakes.  View them as learning opportunities.  If you stumble, acknowledge it briefly (""Excuse me, let me rephrase that..."") and move on.  The audience is usually far more forgiving than you think.
* **Seek Feedback (and *Accept* It",0.3949112296104431,1.2602863895127816e-155,0.029197080291970805,0.09012819678531922
What makes a healthy marriage last?,"Thank you for your question.  A good Marriage is one that takes hard work and commitment.  Being in a good marriage does not always mean good times because let's face it; we are dealing with 2 unique individuals with differences.  A good spouse or partner knows to be patient and accepting.  Knowing each other's strengths and imperfections and working with them to lift each other is how you strengthen your love for one another.  A good spouse sacrifices their needs to see the other person happy.  Don't get me wrong, that also means that it is important to have alone time to re-charge and re-focus our purpose in the marriage.  In all, there is not a magic recipe for a successful marriage, but with time, work and purpose one can have a happy one.","Okay, so you're asking about the ingredients for a lasting, healthy marriage! It's a complex topic, but here's a breakdown of key elements, categorized for clarity.  It's not a magic formula, but a consistent effort in many areas.  I'll try to be thorough, covering emotional, practical, and individual aspects.  I'll also break it down into sections with headings.

**I. Core Foundations: The ""Must-Haves""**

*   **Mutual Respect:** This is *fundamental*. It means valuing your partner's opinions, feelings, and personhood, even when you disagree. It translates to *how* you talk to each other – avoiding insults, contempt, and dismissiveness.  Respect also includes acknowledging their efforts and contributions.
*   **Trust:**  A belief in your partner's reliability, honesty, and good intentions.  This is built over time through consistent actions.  Betrayal of trust (infidelity, lies) is incredibly damaging and takes immense work to repair, if it can be repaired at all.
*   **Commitment:** A conscious decision to stay together and work through challenges, not just when things are easy. It's a long-term perspective that prioritizes ""us"" over ""me"" in important decisions.  Commitment isn't just about *not* leaving; it's about actively *choosing* to stay and invest.
*   **Honesty & Open Communication:** Being truthful, even when it's difficult.  Sharing your thoughts, feelings, needs, and fears openly and honestly, without fear of judgment.  This goes hand-in-hand with respect.
*   **Shared Values:** Having a core set of beliefs about important life areas (family, finances, religion, ethics, goals) that are compatible. Differences are okay, but significant clashes in core values can create ongoing conflict.



**II.  Communication & Emotional Intimacy**

*   **Active Listening:** Truly *hearing* what your partner is saying, not just waiting for your turn to talk.  This includes making eye contact, asking clarifying questions, and summarizing to ensure understanding.
*   **Empathy:** The ability to understand and share your partner's feelings.  Putting yourself in their shoes and acknowledging their emotional experience.  (""I can see why you're feeling that way."")
*   **Vulnerability:**  Being willing to share your true self with your partner, including your fears, insecurities, and imperfections. This fosters deep emotional connection. It requires trust and a safe space.
*   **Regular Check-Ins:**  Dedicated time (even 15-30 minutes a week) to talk about how things are going, not just logistics.  ""How are *you* doing?  What's on your mind?  Is there anything I can do to support you?""
*   **Conflict Resolution Skills:** Disagreements are inevitable.  Healthy couples learn how to argue *constructively*. This means:
    *   Avoiding blame and criticism.
    *   Focusing on the issue, not the person.
    *   Finding compromises and solutions.
    *   Taking breaks when things get too heated.
    *   Learning to forgive.
* **Affection & Appreciation:** Regularly expressing love, gratitude, and appreciation for your partner.  Small gestures, words of affirmation, physical touch – these all matter. Don't assume your partner knows how you feel.
* **Emotional Support:** Being there for your partner during difficult times, offering comfort, encouragement, and a listening ear.

**III. Practical Life & Shared Responsibilities**

*   **Financial Compatibility:**  Having open and honest conversations about money.  Agreeing on financial goals and how to manage finances.  Transparency is crucial.  Financial stress is a major cause of marital conflict.
*   **Fair Division of Labor:** Sharing household chores, childcare responsibilities (if applicable), and other tasks equitably. This doesn't necessarily mean 50/50, but it needs to *feel* fair to both partners.
*   **Shared Activities & Interests:**  Having things you enjoy doing together, whether it's hobbies, travel, or simply spending quality time.  It strengthens your bond and creates shared memories.  But also...
*   **Individual Interests & Space:**  Maintaining your own identity and pursuing your own interests *outside* of the relationship.  This prevents codependency and keeps things interesting.  It’s okay to have separate friends and activities.
*   **Planning for the Future:**  Discussing and making plans for your future together, including goals, dreams, and long-term aspirations.

**IV.  Personal Growth & Adaptability**

*   **Self-Awareness:** Understanding your own strengths, weaknesses, triggers, and emotional patterns.  This allows you to take responsibility",0.5092895030975342,5.379866859272194e-79,0.1065989847715736,0.2876566212891618
"He isn't violent, but he has anger issues and deep insecurities. He's working on them and has improved. We started counseling, and he participated in one or two individual sessions, but we broke up again shortly thereafter. Now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining.","From what you write, you're not too happy with how your boyfriend treats you and how he handles his own life.What keeps you feeling connected to him in positive ways?If you're truly not happy most of the time in this relationship, then you're at the time of asking why you'd want to remain in a relationship which is draining.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it sounds incredibly draining for you. It's good he's *been* working on things, and that he's acknowledged his issues, but it's also understandable that his current behavior is pushing you away, especially after the relationship ended. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, why, and how to navigate this, broken down into sections.  I'll also add a disclaimer at the end.

**Understanding What's Going On**

* **Insecurity & Control:** The constant questions and accusations, even without violence, are often rooted in insecurity.  He's likely trying to control the situation (and you) to alleviate his own anxiety.  It's a way to seek reassurance, but a very unhealthy one. He's likely testing you, looking for evidence to confirm his fears of abandonment or not being good enough.
* **Regression After Breakup:** Breakups are incredibly destabilizing for people, *especially* those with pre-existing emotional vulnerabilities. It sounds like the breakup triggered a regression in his progress.  He may have been relying on *you* as a key component of his emotional regulation, and without that, his insecurities are amplified.
* **Unresolved Issues from Counseling:** One or two individual sessions are rarely enough to address deep-seated issues.  The fact that counseling stopped so soon after the breakup suggests it didn’t provide him with the tools to cope with the loss and the resulting anxieties. It also could be that the breakup brought up things in counseling he wasn't ready to face.
* **Your Needs Matter:**  His improvement is *his* responsibility. You are not his therapist, and you are not obligated to provide him with the emotional labor he needs to work through his issues.  His progress shouldn't come at the expense of your well-being. You are rightly feeling drained.
* **It's Not About You (Even Though it Feels Like It):**  While his questions are *directed* at you, they originate from *his* internal struggles. This doesn’t excuse the behavior, but understanding this can help you detach emotionally and not internalize his accusations.



**How to Respond (and What to Stop Doing)**

This is where it gets tricky. You need to protect yourself while also being mindful that he *is* trying (or has tried) to improve.  Here's a layered approach:

1. **Grey Rock Method:** This is often the most effective starting point.  Respond to his questions and accusations with brief, neutral, and unengaging answers.  Think ""stone-like.""  Examples:
    * **Him:** ""Who were you talking to?""
    * **You:** ""Just a friend."" (No details, no explanation, no justification)
    * **Him:** ""You're avoiding me, aren't you?""
    * **You:** ""I'm just busy.""
    * **Him:** ""You're mad at me, I can tell.""
    * **You:** ""I'm okay.""
    * *The goal is to make yourself a boring, unrewarding target for his probing.*

2. **Set Clear Boundaries (and Enforce Them):**  This is crucial.  You need to tell him, directly and calmly, what you will and will not tolerate.  Be specific.  Examples:
    * ""I'm not going to answer questions about who I'm talking to or what I'm doing. It feels controlling, and I need space.""
    * ""I will not engage in conversations where I'm being accused of things.  If you start accusing me, I will end the conversation.""
    * ""I need you to respect my boundaries.  Constant questioning is draining, and I need you to stop.""
    * **Enforcement is KEY.** If he violates a boundary, *follow through*.  End the conversation, hang up the phone, leave the room.  Don't get drawn into arguments.

3. **Limit Contact:**  This might be the hardest, but it's often necessary.  If he's constantly reaching out, you may need to significantly reduce your interactions.  This could mean:
    *  Not responding to every text or call.
    *  Blocking him temporarily if needed.
    *  Only interacting in specific, limited circumstances (e.g., if you share children or have other unavoidable commitments).

4. **Avoid JADE (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain):** This is a huge one.  It's tempting to try to explain yourself and prove your innocence, but it will only fuel his insecurity and lead to more questions and accusations.  He's not looking for answers; he's looking for a reaction.

5. **Focus on *Your* Well-being",0.477813184261322,2.0768829312394213e-155,0.06544502617801048,0.16891891891891894
"Sometime when small thing happen, like losing a comb, I get furious.  I even start throwing things. Do I have a problem?","I don't like the word ""problem"".  It is such a strong word.  However I would say that you have an issue that needs to be addressed and controlled before it directed at the wrong person and gets totally out of control.  I have found that anger management classes has been helpful for my clients.  Try and see if it will help.  You will be surprised at what you learn about your self.","Okay, this is a really good question to ask, and it's smart of you to recognize that your reaction seems disproportionate to the event.  Yes, it *sounds like* you might have a problem, or at least a pattern of behavior that you'd benefit from understanding and potentially addressing. Here's a breakdown of why, what might be happening, and what you can do about it.  I'll try to be thorough and sensitive.  (Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am not a medical professional.)

**Why this is concerning:**

* **Disproportionate Reaction:** Getting *furious* and throwing things over a lost comb is significantly more intense than a typical reaction (mild annoyance, frustration). This suggests the comb isn't really the issue.
* **Potential for Harm:** Throwing things is dangerous. You could hurt yourself, someone else, or damage property.  Even if you *don't* intend to cause harm, it's a risk.
* **Underlying Issues:** These outbursts often point to underlying stress, unresolved emotions, or coping mechanisms that aren't healthy.  The comb is just a trigger.
* **Impact on Relationships:**  Regular outbursts, even over small things, can strain relationships with family, friends, or partners.  People may become afraid of you or avoid situations that might trigger you.
* **Escalation:** If left unchecked, these reactions could potentially escalate over time, becoming more frequent or intense.



**What might be happening? (Possible explanations - *not* diagnoses!):**

Here are some things that could contribute to this kind of reaction. It's important to remember that only a professional can properly diagnose anything.

* **Emotional Regulation Difficulties:**  You might struggle with managing and controlling your emotions.  This means feelings build up quickly and become overwhelming.
* **Stress & Anxiety:**  High levels of stress and anxiety can lower your threshold for frustration.  Small things feel bigger when you're already on edge.  You might be carrying around a lot of unspoken worries.
* **Unresolved Trauma:** Past traumatic experiences can sometimes manifest as heightened reactivity to seemingly minor stressors.
* **Underlying Mood Disorder:**  Conditions like depression, bipolar disorder, or intermittent explosive disorder (IED) can involve irritability and outbursts. *IED is specifically characterized by impulsive, aggressive outbursts that are out of proportion to the situation.*
* **Perfectionism/High Standards:** If you hold yourself and others to very high standards, you might become easily frustrated when things don't go as planned.
* **Frustration Tolerance:**  You may have a low tolerance for frustration.  Small inconveniences feel unbearable.
* **Sensory Issues:**  Sometimes, people with sensory processing sensitivities can become overwhelmed by seemingly minor disruptions. (Less likely with a comb, but worth considering if you have other sensory sensitivities).
* **Learned Behavior:**  Did you grow up in an environment where outbursts were common?  Sometimes, we unconsciously adopt patterns we observed in childhood.




**What can you do about it? (Actionable steps):**

1. **Self-Awareness & Tracking:**
   * **Journaling:**  Start a journal.  When you have an outburst, write down *everything* that happened *before* it.  What were you thinking?  What were you feeling?  What was the trigger (the comb, in this case)? What physical sensations did you experience? This helps identify patterns.
   * **Identify Triggers:**  Beyond the immediate trigger, what else was going on in your life?  Are there common themes or situations that precede these reactions?
   * **Early Warning Signs:** Pay attention to your body.  Do you feel your heart racing, muscles tensing, or your breathing changing *before* you get angry? Recognizing these early signs can give you a chance to intervene.

2. **Cool-Down Strategies (in the moment):**  These are techniques to use *when you feel the anger rising*:
   * **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system.  Try box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4).
   * **Grounding Techniques:**  These help bring you back to the present moment.  Examples:
      * **5-4-3-2-1:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
      * **Focus on Physical Sensations:**  Feel your feet on the ground, the chair supporting you, or the texture of your clothing.
   * **Time Out:**  Remove yourself from the situation.  Go to another room, take a walk, or simply close your eyes for a few minutes.  Tell",0.4657849967479706,3.7937591469660596e-79,0.05989583333333333,0.2084912812736922
I recently lost a friend to suicide. I'm smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it. How can I handle this better?,"Suicide is a very traumatic loss and affects survivors significantly. Everyone deals with their grief in different ways. One way I recommend to deal with the loss of a loved one is to write letters to them. Some people like to keep the letters in a jar, maybe fill the jar with sand so the letters are buried. I recommend writing the letters as often as you need to. You will notice over time the need to write the letters will decrease and the intense feelings of loss will decrease. I also recommend finding a survivors support group in your area. You can find more information on www.afsp.org.","Okay, I'm so incredibly sorry to hear about the loss of your friend. That's a profoundly painful experience, and it's completely understandable that you're hurting and looking for ways to cope.  It's also really brave of you to recognize that your current coping mechanisms – the increased marijuana and alcohol – aren't likely to help in the long run, and to reach out for suggestions. That self-awareness is a really important first step.  Here's a breakdown of how you can handle this, covering immediate steps, understanding why those substances feel temporarily helpful, and building healthier long-term coping strategies.  I'll also include resources at the end.

**1. Acknowledge the Grief (and the Substance Use as a Symptom)**

*   **It's Normal to Hurt:**  There's no right or wrong way to grieve, and it's going to take time.  Allow yourself to feel the sadness, anger, confusion, guilt, or whatever emotions come up. Don't judge yourself for those feelings.  Suicide loss is particularly complex grief, often filled with more questions and pain.
*   **Substance Use is a Coping Mechanism:**  You're using marijuana and alcohol to *manage* something.  They are temporarily masking the pain, not solving it.  Understanding this is key.  They provide temporary relief, but ultimately worsen grief in the long run (more on that below).  It's not about moral failing; it's about a natural (though ultimately unhelpful) human response to intense pain.
*   **Be Kind to Yourself:**  You've experienced a significant trauma. Treat yourself with the same compassion you would offer a friend going through this.



**2. Why the Substances Are Problematic (Especially in Grief)**

*   **Delayed Grief:** Alcohol and marijuana can *delay* the grieving process.  They can numb emotions, preventing you from fully processing the loss. This means the pain doesn't disappear; it gets postponed, and can resurface later with even more intensity.
*   **Worsened Mental Health:**  Both substances can worsen underlying mental health conditions like depression and anxiety, which are very common after a suicide loss.  Marijuana can sometimes trigger or exacerbate anxiety and paranoia. Alcohol is a depressant.
*   **Impaired Judgment:** This can lead to impulsive behaviors and decisions you might regret, and can interfere with your ability to seek support.
*   **Physical Health:**  Increased substance use takes a toll on your physical health, making it harder to cope with stress and manage daily life.
* **Guilt & Shame:** Using substances to cope can sometimes *add* feelings of guilt and shame to the already complex emotions of grief, creating a negative cycle.



**3. Immediate Steps – Harm Reduction & Stabilization**

*   **Reduce, Don't Necessarily Stop Immediately (Unless…):**  Completely stopping cold turkey can be difficult and even dangerous, especially if you've been using heavily. *However*, if you feel you are losing control or are physically dependent on alcohol, seek medical advice about safe detoxification (see resources at the end).  Start by consciously reducing the amount you use each day/week.
*   **Set Limits:** Decide on specific limits for yourself (e.g., ""I will only smoke marijuana after 6 PM,"" or ""I will only have one drink per day"").  Write it down.
*   **Delay:** When you feel the urge to use, try to delay it for 15-20 minutes.  Distract yourself during that time (see section 4).  The urge often passes.
*   **Hydrate & Nourish:**  Substance use can lead to dehydration and poor nutrition.  Make a conscious effort to drink plenty of water and eat regular, healthy meals.
* **Avoid Triggers:** Identify situations, people, or places that trigger your urge to use and try to avoid them, at least temporarily.




**4. Building Healthier Coping Strategies**

This is the core of long-term healing.  It takes time and effort, but it's essential.

*   **Talk Therapy:**  *This is the most important step.*  A therapist specializing in grief, trauma, or suicide loss can provide a safe space to process your emotions, develop coping skills, and address any underlying mental health concerns.  Look for someone with experience in complicated grief.  (Resources below can help you find a therapist).
*   **Support Groups:**  Connecting with others who have experienced a similar loss can be incredibly validating and helpful.  It can reduce feelings of isolation and provide a sense of community.  (See resources below).
*   **Healthy Distractions:**  Find activities that engage your mind and body without involving substances:
    *   **Exercise:** Physical activity releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting",0.49057087302207947,4.146439942358731e-79,0.08695652173913043,0.22906843112803585
"Maybe this is a stupid question, but I sometimes don't know what's real or not. If feel at times like everyone's lying. How do I know if God is one of those lies?","  It is not a stupid question, it is very basic. To help answer your question, let me begin with the premise that you will never have absolute proof. With that being said, one can look at different phenomena in nature and history and figure what is the statistical probability that they happened randomly. If one comes to the logical conclusion that many are quite improbable, then there must be a guiding force and plan.  May you be successful in your journey.","Okay, that's *absolutely not* a stupid question. It's a really profound one, and it's incredibly brave of you to ask it. Feeling like you can't trust what's real, and extending that distrust to something as fundamental as faith, is a really difficult place to be.  It sounds like you're grappling with some deep uncertainty, and that's okay.  Let's break this down, and I'll try to offer some helpful thoughts.  I'll cover a lot of ground, and feel free to tell me if any part doesn't resonate or if you want me to focus on something specific.

**First, Let's Validate Your Feeling**

It's completely understandable to feel like people are lying. We *are* sometimes lied to.  Disappointment, betrayal, and manipulation happen.  And when you experience that, it creates a sense of wariness.  It's a self-protective mechanism.  It's also a symptom of certain mental health conditions (we'll touch on that later).  So, your feeling isn't irrational; it's a response to something.  The fact that you're questioning everything, even something as deeply held as the idea of God, means you're thinking critically, which is good.



**Why Questioning God Feels Different**

Questioning whether a person is lying feels different than questioning the existence of God. With a person, you're dealing with a known entity (even if you don't know them *well*), a finite being with motivations you might be able to understand.  God, as traditionally conceived, is infinite, beyond human comprehension, and often described as having motivations that are also beyond our understanding.  That makes it harder to apply the same ""lie detector"" you'd use on a person.

**How Do We Even Approach Knowing About God? (And Why It's Not Like Knowing About a Person)**

This is the core of your question. Here's where it gets tricky.  We don't ""know"" God in the same way we know a friend, a family member, or even historical facts.  The ways people have historically approached understanding God fall into a few categories:

*   **Faith:** This is often described as ""belief without proof."" It's a trust in something beyond empirical evidence.  For many, faith isn't a blind leap, but a gradual unfolding of trust built on personal experience, community, and contemplation.
*   **Reason/Philosophy:**  Philosophers have argued *for* and *against* the existence of God for centuries.  These arguments rely on logic, observation of the universe, and moral reasoning. (Think of the cosmological argument, the teleological argument, the moral argument, etc.)
*   **Experience:**  Many people feel they have had personal experiences that lead them to believe in God. This could be a sense of peace, a feeling of connection, answered prayer, or a transformative event.
*   **Revelation:**  This is the idea that God has revealed himself to humanity through scripture, prophets, or other means. (Different religions have different texts and figures considered revelatory).

**Why It's Hard to Prove (or Disprove) God**

*   **The Nature of God:** If God is truly beyond human comprehension, then *by definition* we can't fully prove or disprove God's existence using our limited human tools.  Trying to fit an infinite being into a finite box is...impossible.
*   **Subjectivity:**  Religious experiences are often deeply personal and subjective. What one person interprets as a divine encounter, another might explain through psychology or other natural means.
*   **The Problem of Evil:**  The existence of suffering in the world is a major challenge to the belief in an all-powerful, all-good God.  (Theodicy is the branch of theology that attempts to address this).




**So, How Do You Navigate This?  Here's a multi-pronged approach:**

1.  **Acknowledge the Uncertainty:** It's okay *not* to know.  In fact, a healthy spiritual life often involves wrestling with doubt.  Don't feel pressured to have all the answers.  Embrace the mystery.
2.  **Explore Different Perspectives:**
    *   **Read:** Explore different religious texts (not just the ones you grew up with, if any). Read philosophical arguments for and against God.  Read the works of theologians and spiritual writers.  
    *   **Talk to People:**  Have respectful conversations with people who hold different beliefs than you.  (This requires a willingness to listen, not just debate.)  Talk to people who are devout believers, people who are skeptical, and people who are somewhere in between.
    *   **Consider Different Religions/Spiritualities:**  You don’",0.49862274527549744,0.0073860768263735175,0.07425742574257425,0.220460639915106
"I feel that I need to end my present relationship. He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.","It sounds like you have some insight into the cycle that you describe with your current relationship and at the same time you are still feeling stuck. It also sounds like the distressing feelings that you experience, when you imagine what will happen for you and your current partner, are pretty overwhelming. A competent therapist may be able to help you work through these difficult thoughts and feelings and find a resolution to this cycle that will feel right to you.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and you're incredibly insightful to recognize the pattern you're in. You've clearly put a lot of thought into this, and the fact that you're acknowledging it's *unhealthy* is a huge step. Let's break this down, addressing the core issues and potential ways forward.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Valid Needs:** Your needs are completely valid. Wanting a present, actively engaged life partner is a healthy desire. The long distance combined with his work schedule is genuinely preventing that, and your frustration is justified. You're not being unreasonable.
* **The Cycle of Anxiety & Reconcilation:** This is the key. You identify a problem, communicate it, feel the anxiety of potential loss and loneliness, and then *return to the familiar* even though it doesn't fulfill you.  This is a powerful emotional pull, and it's rooted in a few things:
    * **Fear of the Unknown:**  Being alone feels scary, especially after 7 years. The ""what ifs"" are overwhelming. You fear not finding someone else, and that's natural.
    * **Loss Aversion:**  We feel the pain of a loss (the relationship) more strongly than the potential pleasure of a gain (a better relationship).
    * **Familiarity & Comfort (Even Unhealthy):**  Even a frustrating relationship is *known*. It’s a known quantity, and that can feel safer than stepping into uncertainty.  You know his patterns, his quirks, the way things work, even if ""the way things work"" isn't good for you.
    * **Guilt/Responsibility:**  You might feel guilty about causing him pain, or responsible for his happiness.
* **The Root of the Anxiety/Depression:** It’s not just about *him* with someone else. It's about the fear of being alone, of not being lovable, and of losing the future you've built in your mind, even if that future isn’t what you truly want.
* **It's Not Just About His Behavior:** While his lack of prioritization is a significant factor, the cycle is being maintained by *your* responses to the feelings the separation evokes.



**Breaking the Cycle - A Multi-Pronged Approach**

This isn't just about ""leaving."" It's about changing *how you respond to your own emotions*.  Here's a breakdown:

**1.  Firm Decision & Boundaries (This Time):**

* **Accept the Discomfort:**  You *will* feel anxiety and depression.  That's okay.  It's a normal reaction to loss.  The key is to accept it, not avoid it by running back.  Tell yourself, ""This feels terrible, and it's okay to feel terrible. It doesn't mean I'm making the wrong decision.""
* **No Contact (Initially):**  This is *crucial*.  No calls, texts, social media stalking, nothing.  This allows you to experience your feelings without being soothed (and therefore reinforcing the cycle).  The first few weeks will be the hardest.
* **Acknowledge His Reaction:** He will likely be upset. Allow him to have his feelings, but don't let his emotions dictate your actions.  You’ve already communicated your needs.  You're not responsible for managing his emotions.
* **Resist the Urge to ""Check In"":**  The urge to see if he's okay, or if he's missing you, will be strong.  Don't give in. It's a trap.

**2.  Self-Soothing & Building Support:**

* **Therapy:**  Seriously.  This is the most important thing.  A therapist can provide tools to manage your anxiety and depression, explore the underlying fears driving the cycle, and help you build healthier coping mechanisms.  Look for someone specializing in attachment styles and/or codependency. (See resources at the end)
* **Lean on Your Support System:**  Friends, family, anyone you trust.  Talk about your feelings, but *also* engage in activities with them that distract you and bring you joy.
* **Self-Care is Non-Negotiable:**  Exercise, healthy eating, sleep, mindfulness, hobbies - these aren't luxuries; they're essential for your emotional well-being.
* **Journaling:**  Write down your thoughts and feelings.  It can help you process them and identify patterns.

**3.  Reframe Your Thinking:**

* **Focus on What You *Want*, Not What You Fear:**  Instead of dwelling on the potential loneliness, visualize the kind of relationship you deserve.  What does it look like? How does it feel?  Focus on attracting that",0.48732683062553406,4.532752748039255e-79,0.08831168831168831,0.26597033475709886
How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,"That's a loaded question.  Typically, if we are contemplating if we should or not, it is for a reason.  To really come to a place of decision, you need to know where you are right now, what is not working, what the potential resolution would be and if it is realistic.  If you can answer those questions, you may gain some insight.   If it is realistic and your boyfriend is on the same page, seek help putting a plan in motion for resolution.  And I mention him being on the same page because if he is not, then it will never come to fruiting.  Without much other information, this is this is a solid approach.","Okay, this is a big one, and it's good you're taking the time to seriously consider it. It's rarely an easy decision. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, broken down into sections to help you think through it.  I'll cover self-reflection, evaluating the relationship, looking at patterns, and practical considerations.  This is long, but comprehensive.  I'll also add a disclaimer at the end.

**I. Self-Reflection: What Do *You* Need?**

Before you even start analyzing the relationship, you need to understand yourself.

*   **Your Core Values:** What are the non-negotiable things you need in life and in a partner? (Honesty, respect, ambition, family-orientation, kindness, shared religious beliefs, etc.)  Is he consistently violating those values?
*   **Your Happiness:**  Honestly, are you generally happy when you're *with* him?  Not just in big moments, but in the everyday.  Think about a typical week.  Do you feel drained or energized?  Do you look forward to spending time together, or do you find yourself making excuses?
*   **Your Future:** What do you envision for your future?  Does he fit into that vision?  Not just in terms of career or location, but in terms of lifestyle, family, personal growth, and overall life goals.  Are you both moving in the same direction?
*   **Your Needs:** What are your emotional, physical, intellectual, and social needs? Are they being met in this relationship?  Are you feeling fulfilled?  Think about affection, communication, support, intimacy, and shared interests.
*   **Your Self-Worth:**  Are you staying because you fear being alone, or because you genuinely believe this relationship is good for you?  Do you feel like you're compromising too much of yourself to make it work?  A healthy relationship should *enhance* your self-worth, not diminish it.



**II. Evaluating the Relationship: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly**

Now, let's look at the relationship itself. Be as objective as possible.

*   **Make a List (Seriously):**  Divide a piece of paper (or a document) into three columns:
    *   **Things I Love/Appreciate:**  What are the positive aspects of the relationship?  His qualities, shared experiences, things he does that make you happy.
    *   **Things That Bother Me:**  What are the things that consistently irritate, frustrate, or disappoint you?  These can be big or small. (e.g., He doesn't help with chores, he interrupts me, he's emotionally unavailable, he's constantly late, etc.)
    *   **Dealbreakers:** These are the things you absolutely cannot tolerate in a long-term relationship. (e.g., Abuse – physical, emotional, or verbal; infidelity; addiction; fundamentally different life goals; lack of respect).
*   **Honest Assessment:** Look at your lists.  
    *   Is the ""Things I Love"" list significantly longer and more substantial than the ""Things That Bother Me"" list?
    *   Are the items on the ""Things That Bother Me"" list things that can realistically be improved with communication and effort?
    *   How many ""Dealbreakers"" are on your list? Even one dealbreaker is a serious issue.
*   **Communication:**
    *   **How do you communicate?** Is it open, honest, and respectful?  Or is it characterized by defensiveness, criticism, stonewalling, or avoidance?
    *   **Can you resolve conflicts constructively?** Do you argue fairly, listen to each other's perspectives, and find compromises?  Or do arguments escalate into shouting matches or silent treatments?
    *   **Do you feel heard and understood?** Does he truly listen to you and validate your feelings?
*   **Trust and Respect:**  These are foundational.
    *   **Do you trust him completely?**  If not, what's causing the lack of trust?  Is it based on past actions, or is it your own insecurity?
    *   **Does he respect you as an individual?**  Does he value your opinions, support your goals, and treat you with kindness and consideration?
* **Intimacy:** This isn't just sexual.
    *  **Emotional Intimacy:** Do you feel safe sharing your vulnerabilities with him?  Do you feel emotionally connected?
    *  **Physical Intimacy:** Are you both satisfied with the level of physical affection and intimacy in the relationship?



**III. Recognizing Patterns**

Relationships aren't static.  Look for recurring patterns.

*   **Cycle of Behavior:** Are you stuck in a negative cycle?",0.4868002235889435,4.9670095470163e-79,0.08729139922978177,0.23109243697478993
I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.,"The older I get, the more I believe that our real task isn't to 'find' ourselves. We're already 100% ""there."" What we do have to do is become more mindful of the times when we feel the most alive, most happy, most creative, and most fully engaged with life. It is in those moments that we find ourselves.For example, I couldn't help loving the people or things I loved, no matter who tried to talk me out of them. All I needed to do was notice when my heart opened and I felt the most alive--not because I was afraid or addicted, but because in those moments, I was in contact with my highest self. On the flip side, I needed to recognize the people and activities that consistently brought out the worst in me--the ones that made me feel controlled, constricted, dishonest, resentful, or afraid--and be honest about them. Mindfulness of ""what already is"" is the key to finding yourself. Align yourself with the people and activities that matter most to you. Don't let old habits, crappy jobs, or mean-spirited people define you. Just stumble your way forward as best you can, with greater self-awareness followed by affirmative action..   ","Okay. That's... a really big and important thing to admit. And it's *okay* to not know. It's actually far more common than people let on. So many people spend their lives figuring that out. You're not alone in feeling this way. It takes courage to even say those words, so I want to acknowledge that first.

It sounds like you're at a starting point, and while that can be unsettling, it's also full of possibility.  

Let's break this down a little. When you say you don't know who you are, what does that *feel* like? Is it:

* **A lack of interests?** Like nothing really excites you or holds your attention?
* **A feeling of being different or disconnected from others?** Like you don't fit in anywhere?
* **Uncertainty about your values?**  Not knowing what's truly important to you?
* **A sense of emptiness or a void?**  Just a general feeling of not knowing what makes *you* you?
* **Difficulty defining your personality?**  Like you change depending on who you're with?
* **Something else entirely?**

You don't have to pick one, and it's okay if it's a mix.  Just thinking about *how* you feel lost can be a helpful first step.

Here are a few thoughts, and some things that might be helpful, broken down into categories.  I'll try to keep it from being overwhelming.  **Please read through it at your own pace, and feel free to tell me to stop at any point, or to focus on just one part.**



**1. It's a Journey, Not a Destination:**

* **Self-discovery isn't a quick fix.** It's a lifelong process.  There will be times you feel closer to understanding yourself, and times you feel further away.  That's normal.
* **You are allowed to change.**  Who you are at 20 (or 30, or 40) is not who you have to be for the rest of your life.  Growth and evolution are part of being human.
* **There's no single ""right"" answer.**  There isn't one perfect identity waiting to be discovered.  You *create* your identity through your experiences, choices, and reflections.

**2.  Exploring Your Inner World:**

* **Journaling:**  This can be incredibly helpful.  Don't worry about grammar or writing beautifully. Just write whatever comes to mind.  Prompts can help if you're stuck (see section 4).
* **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  These practices can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings *without* judgment.  There are tons of free guided meditations online (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer are popular apps).
* **Self-Reflection:**  Take some quiet time to think about your past. What were you like as a child? What did you enjoy? What were your dreams? What experiences have shaped you?
* **Identify Your Values:** What principles are most important to you? (e.g., honesty, kindness, creativity, independence, security, adventure).  Knowing your values can guide your decisions and give you a sense of purpose.

**3. Exploring the Outer World (Trying Things Out):**

* **Experiment with hobbies:**  Try new things!  Painting, hiking, cooking, writing, coding, volunteering, joining a club... anything that sparks even a little curiosity. You might discover hidden talents or passions.
* **Step outside your comfort zone:**  Do something that scares you (in a safe way, of course!).  This can help you learn about your limits and build confidence.
* **Spend time with different people:**  Surround yourself with people who inspire you, challenge you, and support you.
* **Travel (if possible):**  Experiencing different cultures and perspectives can broaden your horizons.  Even a day trip to a nearby town can be helpful.
* **Take a class:** Learn a new skill or explore a subject that interests you.

**4.  Journaling Prompts (If you'd like to try writing):**

* What makes you feel most alive?
* What are you naturally good at?  (Don't be humble!)
* What are you passionate about, even if it's something small?
* What are your biggest fears?
* What are your happiest memories?  What do they tell you about what you value?
* If you could change one thing about the world, what would it be and why?
* What are three words your friends would use to describe you?  Do you agree with those words?
* What are you grateful for?

"Whenever I run into a situation that makes me upset or angry, I tend to start cursing and badly offending the person I am confronting. I say mean things to let my anger out. Whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship (like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship) I lash out not just them but at my boyfriend. I feel like I keep causing drama due to my personality. I want to be a better person and learn to let things not get to me and be happy and graceful. I hurt the ones I love with my words. I want to be better for myself and them.","Congratulations on making your way to Step One, self-observation and deciding to change a feature about how you understand and relate to others.There is extraordinary strength in being willing to notice your effect on others and consider what changes are possible.Start on the inside track of your own heart and mind.  Once you're able to understand what is driving your emotions to the point where the only reasonable way of handling them is to curse and offend people, you'd have gotten a long way in knowing your own expectations of others and how far off the mark from this in your mind, they are.For example, if you expect others to always be accepting, tolerant and happy about situations with your boyfriend, and you're hearing otherwise from people, then you can prepare yourself for possible, less than positive comments about your relationship, or you can ask people to not comment to you about your relationship at all.Basically, the more you know about yourself and are willing to accept your right to ask others to respect your views, the easier and calmer time you'll have in handling comments from others that you're not glad hearing.Also, this is a long process because you'd be trying to change long time and deep patterns of interacting.Be patient with your own learning curve and certainly consider therapy for yourself in order to have some outside guidance and support for the process you're placing yourself.","Okay, this is incredibly self-aware and a *really* positive first step. Recognizing this pattern and wanting to change it is huge. You've identified a core issue and are motivated to work on it, which is fantastic. It takes courage to admit that, and you should be proud of yourself for that. Here's a breakdown of what's likely happening, and a bunch of strategies, broken down into sections, to help you move towards the more graceful, happy you that you envision.  It's going to take work, but it's absolutely achievable.

**1. Understanding What's Going On**

* **Emotional Flooding:** What you're describing sounds a lot like emotional flooding.  When you're intensely angry or upset, your brain goes into ""fight, flight, or freeze"" mode.  The logical part of your brain (prefrontal cortex) gets temporarily sidelined, and more primitive, reactive parts take over. This is why the cursing, offensive words spill out *before* you can think about them.  It's not that you *want* to be mean, it's that your system is overwhelmed.
* **Trigger Identification:** You've already pinpointed two major triggers: direct confrontation and hearing negative information about your relationship. That's excellent! The more specific you can get about *what* about those situations sets you off, the better.  Is it feeling attacked?  Feeling controlled?  Feeling insecure?  Feeling like your relationship is being disrespected?
* **Underlying Emotions:**  Often, anger is a *secondary* emotion.  Underneath the anger might be feelings like:
    * **Hurt:**  Someone said something that stung.
    * **Fear:**  Fear of being judged, fear of losing your boyfriend, fear of being vulnerable.
    * **Insecurity:**  Doubts about yourself or your relationship.
    * **Feeling Disrespected:** Like your boundaries are being crossed.
* **The Cycle of Reactivity:** You're likely caught in a cycle.  Something happens, you get triggered, you react explosively, you feel guilt/shame afterward, and then you're more likely to be sensitive and reactive to the next trigger.



**2. Immediate Strategies – In the Heat of the Moment**

These are things to try *when you feel yourself starting to escalate.*  They won't be easy at first, and you might not succeed every time.  That's okay.  Practice is key.

* **The Pause (Crucial):**  This is the hardest but most important.  When you feel the anger rising, *physically pause*.  Stop talking.  Take a deep breath (or several). Count to five.  Anything to create a tiny bit of space between the trigger and your reaction.  This is about interrupting the automatic response.
* **Name the Emotion:**  Silently (or even aloud, if appropriate) say to yourself, ""I'm feeling angry right now.""  Or, ""I'm feeling hurt.""  Simply naming the emotion can help to lessen its intensity.  (""I'm feeling overwhelmed"" is also good.)
* **Grounding Techniques:** These bring you back to the present moment.  Examples:
    * **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Focus on Your Breath:**  Pay attention to the sensation of your breath going in and out.
    * **Press Your Feet into the Ground:**  Feel the solidness beneath you.
* **""I"" Statements (Instead of ""You"" Statements):** This is a classic, but it works.  Instead of, ""You're always gossiping and ruining everything!"" try, ""I feel really hurt and upset when I hear rumors about my relationship.""
* **Remove Yourself:**  If you can, physically remove yourself from the situation.  Say, ""I need a few minutes to cool down.  Let's talk about this later.""  *And then actually follow through.* Don't just stew in another room.  Go for a walk, listen to music, do something calming.
* **Write it Down:** If you absolutely *must* get the words out, write them down in a journal, a note, or a text message *to yourself* that you will not send.  This is a way to vent without hurting anyone.




**3.  Long-Term Strategies – Building Emotional Resilience**

These are things you can do *outside* of heated moments to make you less reactive overall.

* **Therapy:** Seriously consider therapy. A therapist can help you explore the root causes of your reactivity, develop coping mechanisms, and learn healthy communication skills.",0.5310311317443848,6.444212526707933e-79,0.13800424628450106,0.3088569866340325
