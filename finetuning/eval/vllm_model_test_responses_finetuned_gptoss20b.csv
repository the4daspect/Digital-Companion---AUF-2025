"We weren't long distance until he joined the military.  I love him and I know he loves, me but it's complicated. He said he's not going to find someone else, but I'm afraid. How do I keep our relationship going?","You're wise to be aware of possible changes to your relationship once your bf is away from you for extended time periods.All you both can do is state your intentions and wishes, keep in contact as much as possible, and wait to see how your relationship unfolds.To a large degree, each of you is relying on faith that if the relationship is meant to last for a while, then it will.   The military may add stress.This doesn't necessarily mean the stress will dissolve the relationship.Sometimes all anyone is able to do, is try.","I can sense that you are connected with him.How long have you been in the relationship?Is there anyone in his life that you find threatening to your engagement to be in his life?Do you have any suicidal thoughts?Since you have recently attached with partner, it works hard to have several unshared thoughts in your head.Do you have other matters in your mind that could be negatively affecting attachment you have with partner?Is he contributing to the lack connection you are feeling with him?I don't see any mention of any sort of commitments about the soldier, aren't we clear about this?Does the emotionally distant or withdraw he carries presenting cause you doubt about future in relationship?I recommend therapy with whom you can discuss and process the thoughts that arise in mind for now.We learned skills about marriage and responsibility to be more engaged in meeting needs of partners.Emotions and behavior develop in patterns that influence much of our reactions to others in context of relationshipsLike you mentioned you're afraid to have an affair,I'd ask you what would you get in return by having an affair?"
"I have no real friends. I have a girlfriend who irritates me but loves me to death. I push her away and pushes me away. We’re going through a breakup, and I have nobody.","Having time all to yourself may be necessary so you have time to reflect on your own identity and values, become more clear on what matters most to you, and with this increased self-understanding, be able to attract people who will feel like satisfying friends.Having a relationship with someone whom you push away and are pushed away, with someone who is irritating, seems to have limited benefit for each of you.Maybe you are together from fear of being alone, and being alone is exactly what you may now need in your life in order to draw more favorable people to you.","I think this is exactly what often it is with relationships and being in love. Your emotions are intense and come forth unfiltered. This is your human reaction, emotionally engaged in whatever or whoever you're feeling comfortable around. :) At what times or moments are you tempted to say the loveingly encouraging and loving things? When you express strong feelings that the relationship is ending for good, when your girlfriend wants help or support, or just after your morning coffee? What makes the times that it's just you apart from being upset about the endings? ‏I would also love you to have a real conversation with your girlfriend about expectations. I'm not sure it's the love you feel towards each other or the break up that would be the best places for that. Incorporating expectations and discussing them is important, it can even be healthy for the relationship, before it's broken up. Mr. Treat from Solution Focused Couple Therapy, say that as a general rule, it's best to bring up relationship talk during periods of satisfaction or very strong positive affect. Why? There is a ""relationship script"" that couples have, and when being upset and contemplating the relationship==""end"", you're already off the track of your relationship script. Whereas, if you're checking in with your each other regarding your expectations and tensions, chances are you're feeling very good about each other currently. By making those upgrades in a positive context, you might have built enough of a buffer to be securer.Whatever time of the day or moments throughout your day you're pulled into expressing a negative frame about yourself and relationship, I would want those instances to feel safe, mediated by a strong, positive frame. That's something therapists come in handy for because they have tools and validation and support to help you do it .I would want to know: are there about 10 social contact moments with your girlfriend that could be placed in a context from this approch and could practically be delivered? I wonder if she has other hourly doses of it. My point is: you're not being conclusion-titled as ""there is no love for me."" !You'll notice pushing each other tells us something. What have you noticed? What are the triggers? How do you want the overall dynamic of your emotional communication between each other? Change is possible. Time-wise though, it might be too easy to get pulled back into the loops of unmediated moment of crisis without importance being given to address it. I wish you the best of luck with (or without) success 100% gain! I'd say: best of luck!"
I feel like my time is going too fast,"Thank you for reaching out! That is a great question! As an American, I can truly say that I spend way too much time on the go! It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe! I often ask myself, what if I only had one day left on this Earth? What would I do? Well, that is an easy question. I would spend it with my family! Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World, right? Its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring.Time management is a very important factor when learning to ""live life to the fullest""! In fact, this is a required course in undergraduate college now. Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this. Personally, for myself I like to keep a calendar with a to-do list. I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list. That way, if I do not get through the list, I am not stressing over the little things. When planning your day, it is important you schedule work, eat and play. A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. There is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this, then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse/partner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there. Again, everyone has their own style on time management. I hope this was helpful for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out for anything further!","If the change in the process of feeling time is interesting to you, you may want to learn more about the ways in which your personal perception of time changes through life. While we may wish that our experience of time passed would suddenly shorten the pace of it, the fact is that we all continually reevaluate what it means for us to “live fast” or “age in reverse.”"
"He wants to wear makeup and heels. He even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina. He wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him. I have tried this for him, but I don’t like it and have told him so. He keeps making comments about it and says he can't live without it.","It sounds like you may be asking two different questions.With regard to what you said about your husband dressing as a female in your bedroom, I wonder if you would consider asking him more about this. If you choose to do that, I would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience. This can be difficult to do at times, particularly when you may want to offer your own opinions or become very anxious or of type. Consider thinking of a phrase that may help you to stay calm during the discussion. It may be helpful to think of yourself as asking questions as if you were an investigative reporter and using questions that start with words like ""what, how, who, where, when."" Questions that start with ""why,"" can be very difficult to answer for some people and can be overwhelming because it often links to answers involving emotions that may or may not be understood. Also try restating what your husband is saying to make sure that you are understanding correctly. If what he is telling you is different than what you have heard or thought of for many years, it may be challenging to follow his meaning initially. Remember that listening to your husband does not imply agreement with what he is saying, just that you are following and looking to understand what he is experiencing. I also recommend sticking to one topic for the conversation, but this could be done with many different topics over time.You could also see if he would be willing to have a discussion where he listens like an investigative reporter to learn more about the experience that you are having.As far as what you mentioned about the sexual experience, maybe if you can discuss what it is that you don't like and/or understand what it is that he does like, you could see if there is some middle ground here. It depends on what you both prefer.These types of conversations can be difficult to have for some couples, at least initially. Having structured conversations, such as the ones I've described briefly above, can feel awkward initially, but the reason it can be helpful is because it can lead to further understanding in a way that decreases the chances of having an argument.Also consider seeing a therapist in your area who specializes in couples to discuss some of these ideas.","congrats on being aware of your own needs and boundaries. I would offer who you are allowed to cuddle with, and who is allowed to touch you in what ways and based on your body's signals, you have a right, memory says. How much is too much erotic touching in general? Some people don't understand what non sexual touch such as a hand on your shoulder really feels like.

"I am a really shy person. I'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?","First of all, way to go in stretching yourself out of your comfort zone! You are sure to grow through all of this practice presenting to your peers, and that in itself will help to grow your confidence over time. In the meantime, do whatever you can to help yourself feel prepared for each presentation. Do your work ahead of time so that you feel well-informed on your topic, and then spend the days leading up to your presentation practicing. Do your presentation in the mirror, while you are driving (if it won't distract you from the road), and practice in front of a friend. On the day of the presentation, eat a balanced meal, get a pep talk from a supportive friend, use deep breathing to keep your body calm, and remind yourself that you are prepared. You got this!","Fast question/answer: Practice making a speech.. Somewhere where content is relevant, interesting, and encouraging.

"I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental.
   I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?","It is very good news that you realize the risks of smoking cigarettes while pregnant and are willing to stop.Thinking about smoking is a typical and frequent reaction to being without the substance.Be creative with what you know about yourself to distract you when this psychological urge comes up.  My suggestions are to imagine smoking if you find this would relieve the sense of wanting to smoke.Or, do the opposite and remind yourself of all the good reasons to not smoke.Also, since you're planning pregnancy then ask your partner for ideas on how to make the psychological feeling to want to smoke, feel less intense.Another suggestion is that your partner is your texting buddy to stop smoking.   With AA groups, a sponsor is always available for the alcoholic who feels distress about the urge to drink.   Having a trusted and caring person to tell about your problem helps in many situations.  Maybe it will help you to stop smoking.Good luck!","Eating whole, organic foods is a good place to start, especially in view of your plans to become a mother. The nutrients and antioxidants found in whole foods help reduce nicotine cravings and it helps repair some body damage caused by smoking.{{Water.}}  I mentioned this because drinking lots of water helps the body flush toxins out of the system. (Smokers tend to forget how much water they need to drink over and out; It is a hard habit to break.)You should aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day, and it's a bit higher if the weather is mild. (When you go for a walk in most of the lot we get walked, it's best to drink water, coz it helps keep your body out of ""crisis mode"" if I've known a person for a while, he usually has been told to drink water all the time, and then he goes outside in a sunny day and says ""I'm okay, I don't need water""%  Try drinking a glass a few hours after you smoke. So if you smoke very regularly, say, one every 30min-. Find excitment in doing that (Swapping strings on two solos trumpet you've got in back were stands, you play it twice one minute later on.  Get happy selling weed/soft call girlfriend, screw doctor with your home to rock, make jokes about it etc.)If you're hesitating about the whole ""physical needs"" thing, think about this: Some people can't function I know with their whole life working without flying drones in a dogfight (an actual dogfight? Board, I'm wearing my goggles, Bolivia's the team bets a bowl of cevicheBe that person if you smoke anymore (it depends on how much) Buying life insurance might be a good idea, becuase you might still need it, and you might as well buy it in advance.So what you need to do when thinking of smoking, first off..Try walking out of the room, and onto the street, or the loo, or wherever, then get busy like a madman (Do 20 Du Stretchy things, drink a glass, use a planner in your head without being born normally... The more distracted you are the more you ""need"" to act on the way you used to. That is how people actually stop smoking (replacing old habit, with a new one, naturally.) Hope that helps one way or another! Cheers!Take care! Hint about insurance can make people think (if I'm smoking it's going to happen to me, I hope I am crazy enough to have this type of insurance)Â  Eva."
"I found the guy I’m dating on dating websites. He was telling women that they were beautiful. He said it wasn’t him and that the phone was hacked. It has since happened two other times. He says he loves me and I’m the only girl he wants to be with, but I feel he is not telling me the truth.","I would suggest possibly talking about the type of relationship that both of you want to create. For example, you may want a relationship where honesty, listening, compassion, and romanticism are major parts. You could also see what your boyfriend wants.You may also consider taking five minutes to see if he will listen to your feelings about him being on the dating site and whether he can work to learn more about what you are experiencing with asking open-ended questions (not being answered with yes or no) and restating what you are saying to see if he has it right. After that, perhaps you could switch so that you can listen to his perspective for five minutes and learn more about what he is doing by asking open-ended questions.Remember that it takes two people to have  a relationship, so the choice is yours as to whether you choose to stay in the relationship and what kind of relationship you would like to have.","I can hear the little girl in you trying to protect herself because she knows this is very much against her nature. Somewhere deep inside her you are watching and hoping she is safe. From a different corner of your body, there is a Trust, Confidence, Faith. That is saying: He is right. I am in love with him. And I am so lucky that he loves me too. Now, you are very curious about his actions on other websites. Inside the space of your imagination, you feel that maybe there is a possibility of him having had an affair. That cannot be the case but inside your proximity-hovering world of thoughts, you are imagining it, almost as a possibility. I am trying to help you to understand that it would be very strange if you can get closure on this by just listening to what he says. If he loves you, he will be THERE to sincerly confess to you the truth and also give you some proof of it if needed. Sometimes we are blind not to seeing what we want to see. There are lots of ways we learn how to move past bitterness, resentment and depression: Apologizing, reclaiming your voice, clarity of purpose, moving forward... I think you can do these things as long as the right someone who filled your soul with love is in it too. In the process, you will be able to let go of disappointments and betrayal, gain your confidence and sweet self-esteem, feel whole and loved again. When you do, the touch of your hands alone will be enough to heal all the wounds and close this story 404.  But I sense that maybe there is not your lover in this story.

"After I told them, they yelled at me.","It's most important that you accept yourself and surround yourself with a group of friends who are kind to you and love you.

Your son is now afraid of talking about things because of the yelling in your home.  Maybe with the help of a Parenting Instructor or an expert caregiver you can eliminate yelling and replacing it with healing and strengthening words without insulting him.  Change jobs might be recommended to avoid physically removing him from a bad place in terms of the relationship between mother and father.  Therapist is probably a necessity.  Change the environmental conditions that support his learning and environment.He might have trouble concentrating if a parent is yelling and perhaps could benefit from specialized learning clinics.Either way, he needs more positive attention and healing from resentments of bad times.Now he is allowed to talk about your family problems with a neutral third person and feels safe to do so.

"I’ve been on 0.5 mg of Xanax twice a day for the past month. It hasn't been helping me at all, but when I take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack, it calms me down. I was wondering how I can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking I'm abusing them. I just have very big anxiety attacks. Should I stay on the 0.5mg and deal with the attacks or should I ask to up the dose? I'm afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else.","Do you think you're abusing xanax?It is a highly addictive drug so maybe one reason you feel compelled to take more is bc you already are addicted.Drugs don't do anything helpful in solving life's problems.   Once the effect wears off, the stressful situation is once again waiting for you to address it.Think over your reason for not directly asking your psychologist about upping your dose.Also, do you ever talk about your life problems with this psychologist or only your need for drugs?    The more gradual path to a better life is to not need drugs in the first place. This consists of your willingness to face the matters that are creating such terrible feelings inside you.","If you feel that the dose you are taking is not working for you, it's OK to tell your psych. Whether or not they will be happy with what you say, they need to know in order to help you. Therapists, along with you, and your doctor/ psychiatrist are partners in helping you lead a happier, healthier and more satisfying life. Your job is to provide the information about how you feel and the meds work for you first hand. Your therapist is then able to bounce this information off your doctor or prescriber.

"I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental.

I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?","Hi. Good for you in planning ahead to do what's healthiest for your baby (and yourself). That's a great first step! It's also good that you are able to identify that it's not always a physical need that's driving the addiction.For the next steps, I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological (or mental) cravings are usually based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if you're consciously trying to quit, you'll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. Well, if I'm on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually I'll give in and eat it.You're going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. That's normal and, for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. That's what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it (""Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now.""), but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.I've suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they're going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.Best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby!","Hi, Congratulations on deciding to quit smoking - not an easy thing to do and I'm glad you don't want to end up with a heavy smoker parent. Sneak smoking is not harmless and you need to foreshadow what happens when you quit for your baby. Quitting smoking is mentally hard because you are breaking an old pattern of mentally compulsive thinking daily and part of building a new behavior is changing the thoughts behind that behavior. Quitting rooted in the physical look for nicotine is great but building different ways to get out of the mental loop of thinking about cigarettes will help you get over any nagging mental cravings. You can start by asking you self ""What am I feeling right now? Can I do something else to get through this?"" Sometime your dependent thinking and craving has its own rules for you or it's a problem substituster. Don't try to inspect the problem but wait until you notices craving and deal with it.That was more for awareness that you are readonly triggers or systems for cravening. When is my craving coming on less time. Can I do something different? (Scent, aromatherapy) What am I doing when I'm atrigged?Is there something I will miss when I stop smoking?What if I tried again?  When did you go to the doctor? How did you feel on the day you began trying to quit?It could be nice to genrate some excitement why you want to quit or at least find comon ground doing something you enjoy knowing you will limit that urge. What are some fun feelings about Baby and getting a new tear?Maybe your nicotine dependence aid gives you some ideas about things that you can do in place of smoking. Your chemist and doctor are one step closer to telling you that your dependant about nicotine is beginning to pipe into nerves expecting release of reward via the amount of time you've been trying  to quit, or that you have an easy task of making a habbit form of stopping all tuigging.

"I'm transgender, I know I am, but I've only told a few friends. I know I can't tell my family because of previous conversations we've had. They just wouldn't accept it.
My gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own. I need some strategies for dealing with it. What should I do?","Hello, and thank you for your question. I am so glad that you reached out for help. I know that the dysphoria can feel nearly impossible to handle, especially since you have limited support from people who accept who you are. You may already know some of these resources, but I am going to share a few. 1. The website www.letsqueerthingsup.com is a blog from a very good writer that I know. His name is Sam Dylan Finch, and he is transgender. He writes about mental health, transgender issues, and many other topics. I know he has frequently written about gender dysphoria and ways to manage it. You may want to check out his site and do a search on there. 2. The website www.everydayfeminism.com employs many transgender writers and several have written about gender dysphoria and have given ideas for managing it. If you search for gender dysphoria on their site, many articles pop up. It may be a good resource for you, especially if you ever feel lonely and start to forget that there are others out there who are like you and have your back. 3. I am not sure where you live, but there are counselors who specialize in affirmative therapy, which is what is recommended for folks who are part of the LGBTQ community. So, if you decide to see a counselor about the dysphoria, try to find one that specifically says they have been trained in the affirmative approach. In addition, feel free to ask questions of the counselor before agreeing to see them for counseling. An ethical counselor would have no problem answering them before having you come in. 4. If there are some LGBTQ resource centers in your area, try to reach out to them and see if there are support groups. Gaining more support from others would be helpful. Sometimes LGBTQ-friendly counselors leave their contact information for people in resource centers. 5. Finally, I know you have not mentioned being depressed or suicidal, but I also know that it is very common for people to consider suicide when they are struggling with dysphoria, dealing with transphobia, etc. If this ever happens to you, please call 911 or the Trans Lifeline. It's free at 877-565-8860. Visit their site at www.translifeline.org. I hope some of these ideas help. Feel free to send another message if you have a follow-up question.Be well....be YOU.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC ","The most helpful strategy I would suggest for dealing with gender dysphoria on your own is to explore all aspects of gender dysphoria and transgender identity in a safe, confidential, and supportive relationship with a client-centered counseling relationship. I work on this and many other aspects of gender dysphoria and the development of positive transgender identity in this type of therapeutic relationship. To structurally and exclusively address the dimension of gender dysphoria I'm motivated and experienced in using guided imaginal and behavioral experiments, guided cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, mindfulness, the bifocal design approach to understand binary and non-binary gender identities, narrative therapy tools for exploring and affirming your gender identity within your family?s expectations, and dialectical behavioral therapy (skills) for regulating emotions difficult or occurring due to the stress of gender dysphoria and lack of adequate social support. It's possible that a gender dysphoria specialist is not available where I live in my state. Unfortunately many therapists are not well-developed in understanding gender dysphoria and other aspects of a transgender client?s psychology. One opposite effect of following non-expertise in a therapist is not sufficient understanding and sensitivity of the impacts of the cultural ability to suppress, lower-self-esteem or internalize gender dysphoria and shame and partial acceptance of opposing ideas promoting non-binary identification such as Buddhist ideas. The growing interest and knowledge of issues around gender dysphoria and non-binary identification empowers non-binary individuals. This fact may affect some individuals who need therapy due to unspoken or real prejudices while collaborating with a therapist.I'd also suggest you explore all of your resources and barriers preventing disclosure of your gender dysphoria. Which Items? Group counseling..?Transgender groups (virtual/non-virtual) or intercultural community group? Family, close friends... exploring and reflecting can help you identify and more effectively communicate that your desire not to disclose your gender dysphoria based on: a) fear of disapproval, negative positions, blame, and blame... or b) fear of alienation, lack of support, or staff treatment of barriers to affirming your gender identity. I can't say exactly the cause of these barriers/disclosure concerns, but certainly understanding and communicating these intuitions and fears may help to reduce them. ""Ask First, Then Decide."" You can gather info and talk to a therapist about creating a credible plan for disclosing your gender dysphoria in stages.* Relent: ""Vanishing Anxiety"" is classic CBT strategy for anxiety. 3 little steps occur over and over for 5 to 7 days. Follow a daily script for 5 to 7 days. Fear there has to be ""room to plan"" reduce panic anxiety. All day tutorials have helpful mindfulness practices (plus lets you practice ""sprinkling mindfulness"" around whole day). Managing panic anxiety and exposing (""Vanishing Anxiety"" strategy) may help you release additional anxieties related to gender dysphoria. Then write a letter, keep the letter if needed.Seminary-paired students writing Spirit-blessed responses on your support card; one from each stratum (family, extended family, friends, school, purveyors of affection) will affix their words to your card. You can either handwrite or type your letter. I'll scan it, write little things in the margins: ""advice,"" ""interior support,"" encouraging words"" so a powerful response, glowing support.(But really all ages are welcome on this project!).This creative mindfulness writing exercise may help you guard agitating anxiety a little. Using a Socratic approach may guide your emotions down good ways of managing dysphoria or handling community misconstrued ideas of your gender identity. Sometimes turning this critical fear muse to more constructive questions might be useful (""Socrates asks 40, average old wise man answers 20, every question gets me further cancer depressed spine. What if those questions were truly wise?"").I also suggest daily practice of mindful breathing writing for one minute; you need 8 words in your sentence (8 syllables). Minuse guess how many wafts of gentle silence to send in your daily practice? (Mindful breath subtrahends deafening clicks of anxiety!). Talking and/or journaling will increase your self-esteem. Feeling good about yourself is the foundation of gender and role transition, job change, or change of any sort of direction.

"Whenever I leave my girlfriend I get panic attacks. I'm taking medications to control them, but I'm thinking of moving in with her since I get so anxious.","I’m sorry to hear that you are currently experiencing panic attacks. I hope that the medication you have been prescribed has provided you with some relief. Unfortunately, I don’t feel that moving in with your girlfriend would alleviate your anxiety. Although you may feel very anxious about leaving her, your body is reacting to this stressful event in your life in an unhealthy manner. You may be able to render this particular situation but it’s likely that you may experience another panic attack when an additional stressful event arises. Therefore, it is essential that you address the reason for why you are experiencing panic attacks in the first place followed by practicing coping mechanisms in the case that one would arise in the future.Talk therapy has shown to be effective with those affected by anxiety along with breathing exercises and yoga. A trained therapist will be able to assist you in finding the right stress reducing method so that you can reduce the chance of another attack occurring.I wish you the best of luck! It sounds like you are very happy in your relationship and I hope you are able to reduce your anxiety so that you are able to enjoy one another.","I would recommend caution before making the decision to move in. Panic attacks or anxiety symptoms are often associated with relationship problems or concerns. Panic attacks aren't a problem by themselves, but are the symptoms of potentially deeper concerns. You'll have to decide if they are acceptable to you or not. Sticking in the panic attack and dealing with whatever caused it feels like the healthiest option in the long run."

Healing is possible and getting your happiness back is also possible.Feel free contact me for additional help or informationLaura Cassity, LMSW, LMAC","Depression is a unique and personal vital sign for all of us. It means at some point our life has been and is affected by a big change. It needs to be repaired or balanced.   My guidance here is more in terms of needing to be honest with yourself about what you feel is happening now and find relief to balance it. We can do that without talking with other people.  I recognize the fact that it would be nice to feel comfortable talking about private life changes to others. Tell yourself doing that would be courageous. You already are by acknowledging your own behavior and images of how much merit it takes for you to consider opening up. You can go toward people whom you trust as example of people who can be courageous with you. There are also stories and pictures of people I will reference for other purposes. I will have a case concept on what I'm doing with you. To keep my service distinct to my other service on Marriage and Family with my wife, I won't specifically disclose that. I can show you a clinician profile where my services can be understood.  I think this type of specificity may be counter relevant to helping adults with Gerald Whitaker's generosity model of distance in which intent to war with yourself corresponds to the possibility of war with your family.   I would like to have you feel that your engagement of these services on and off is for your own importance at this time in your life. I will have other ways of staying connected via email. In most cases, I won't initiate contact with a client in the off-state. But it won't feel lonely because of our contact. We can touch base since you're not seeing me at the same time.   If the depression has more intensity or you have new experiences around lying themselves, I will know why we need to start again developing trust in the sense of you're present in this therapy, now. Those signals can be the means whereby my offering would be more specific. It would be definitely okay and not questionable for me to identify myself as a counselor in regards to the therapeutic relationship. That part of the service I set apart in giving intuition. I'd be happy to be made explicit if you want. I can invite you to use what were called ""family conversations"" from Whitaker that start with ""I hear at first my inner feelings are..."" My ""inner feelings"" is an idea of something happening within yourself. It often is telling about what you feel yourself doing. One usual outcome of this is ""I'm going to do this for my self"" or ""I just won't be able to do this."" The second statement is indicating depression. The first statement is often ""me selfish!""  (PD 2.0 and the 1993 diagnose manuals)\n ""Family conversations"" also are a way of strengthening your feeling about yourself as someone who takes care of your inner world.   I will share with you a definition of ""self-working literature"" or ""literature of self and the world"".   I'm working to get it right.  Each adult learns to be a real person in balancing myself and being open to partner. At any time you ""depress yourself"", half of who you are is collapsed, you lose a part of who you really are.You can balance out the self with literature or talk therapy or to partner. I have my case model. You can have yours.  It's standard in counseling and has time lines when it's revisited.  The same will be true after your depression is settled or reduced. I appreciate you expressing something you're aware of and don't expect everyone else does. Letting that assessment speak to you at low intensity, on its own time goes by and gets better. I am telling you I get it.  Many will say ""tell her brother,"" ""tell my boyfriend."" Others say, ""tell Dad"" or ""My kid wants her mom to talk with someone."" Those are common things I've explained and they don't of out of love for you or want to control you. Their therapies are imperfect like all our therapies. Their ethics may differ from what you need. Your therapist wanted the time to make the change setting aside the ensemble of relationships you make up who you are. If your practice is being unconditional positive in your therapy, you may start to feel that same response from your family.  Out of illness we can choose how we feel towards who we are. Your own feelings are a necessary part of the whole therapeutic context. And even sometimes  (there are  more mechanisms within fidelity and generosity between couples, to recognize the open attunement of physical contact > actual therapy is forwarded in between) maybe not at the same moment, I may continue to share my impressions with you when you come back. But you would have awareness and receive much of your working myself with the very telling interview and telling story journal during the places between the sessions. See you soon.   Yours breastfeeding nurse in the clinic, Oktavia"
"I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.
I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. While your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard. Talk to them during a non-emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as ""you NEVER listen,"" ""you ALWAYS say..."" and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with ""you"" try using ""I"" by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist, teacher, or school counselor if possible. Most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help.Best of luck to you.","Two major life changes happen, you're a teenager now, and you're pansexual. Either can trigger emotional turmoil. Your parents probably don't know how to deal with each event, then you have to deal with each one. What's probably best is to start over and work on the communication with your parents. How will you continue to talk about each of those issues for the first time? Maybe it's counseling. Maybe it's just a good old-fashioned heart-to-heart. This needs to be a conversation about what you're feeling and thinking right now, and what led up to where you are at this very instant. I also encourage open, honest and meaningful conversations with your friends as well."
"My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the ""straight and narrow"" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that I'm not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others.    His insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","You might ask your fiance about people who have let him down in the past; past hurts from parents, friends, people he has dated. If you are speaking about jealousy he may come from a divorced parent upbringing, may have seen parents cheat on one or the other, may have had partners cheat on him in the past.  He may have fears that you may go off the ""straight and narrow"" once you get married. Listen to any concerns with patience and understanding, avoid being defensive. I would highly encourage pre-marital counseling to explore these things and individual counseling for himself to work on fears and anxieties. If he refuses and things do not improve I would consider postponing the wedding, things will not get better once you get married, only magnified.  Finally show him Bible passages about forgiveness and worry and leaning on God with faith and hope for the future.    God bless.","I want to encourage you to reach out to him for deeper exploration of what is making it difficult for him to move away from your past. When we rush to judge or “fix” someone, we tend to do wrong instead of right, with the result of increasing the gap between our own expectations and the other’s behavior. By asking him to share and reflect on his thoughts and feelings about your past, the big truth may emerge that he is making unfair judgments in his mind about both you and himself. He might be unsure whether he can forgive you (or think himself worthy) for what you have done (even something as small as cutting his hair too short or on a different day), with the big consequence that he may forget that your past was only a number of years ago. Or perhaps his judgement of your past is actually one reflection of his own mood and he is perhaps working through some conflict between who he needs to be and who he is. By staying curious rather than confrontational, I predict he will open up more and could benefit from therapy, either together or on your own—for example, to learn some new learning. Feelings of discomfort from being “fucked up” (not literally) are not uncommon in the high roller's life, and a trusted counselor could provide a more thorough understanding of the nature of his discomfort. Remember, everyone has a past. Whatever I went through as a child or teenager or and that makes me who I am today, you are still the same wonderful person that I fell in love with. And the same applies for him."
My fiancé and I broke up. He cheated on me numerous times. I kept forgiving but questioning his every move. He got tired and left.,"Cheating on you shows a lack of commitment, in addition to the emotional hurt it creates.Probably you didn't actually forgive him because if you did, then you wouldn't have been asking questions of his every move.Maybe you were open to forgiving him.   In order for forgiveness to be effective, the person who has done the injuring must first show some understanding and empathy for the great pain the person caused in you.From what you write, your fiancé didn't seem to have much interest in earning back your trust or in empathizing with the way his cheating effected you.It is very likely his tiredness is also tiredness you feel, of having to watch him all the time.As uncomfortable as adjusting with the disappointment of him leaving you, the situation you describe sounds like it was unsatisfying for both of you.","Given your insistence on forgiveness despite constant cheating on my part, I must point out that the effort to ""always forgive"" and whether or not my fiancé is being guilty in his behavior is a bit disconnected in my mind. Not once did you say you forgave him, so that is a little confusing because, as stated in the title, he cheated many times. Did you choose forgiveness? Forgiveness doesn't happen automatically but is decided often in re-memorizing situations where we are still possibly inflicted with emotional damage from those situations, so it doesn't make sense to dismiss that damage after the person who has caused us harm leaves our lives. Let me first address to the debate at hand of whether or not we forgive our partners. My first thought is that if we do happen to experience betrayal, you have the choice to forgive something that has intellectual meaning (i.e., I forgive you) and choose to allow the tending to some wound in the mind. So forgiving the act itself doesn't negate or erase the act itself. However, we also forget the acts we did and the memories are slowly erased. So allowing the act in our memories to continue creating emotion around some part of our body (the brain, as I mentioned above, or heart), you are constantly pushing migraine-level emotional damage in your emotional mind that we would rather not go through again. So part of the original act that triggered whatever we called the betrayal isn't being processed with any meaning and emotional catharsis. Forgiveness literally means lifting the curse. And this curse would include referring to each other in some way that was prohibited. Did I forgive him for cheating? No. Would I accuse anyone of something that wasn't happening on a standard timeline? Yes. How often did it happen? Ten times? Or did you have some week knotted in your head that marked when ""It is already day ten"" ? Your emotional mind didn't feel that there was anything reasonable for your fiancé to do.  Regardless, have fun seeing how many times you have felt cheated even after the relationship. Now this is a strange question, what will happen to your emotions if you decided to forgive him over the course of holding each incident in your memory? There are a million different sources that would tell you to let go. Actually the one that got through the best to my mind is Steven Hayes, and so called ""T-Elusive Therapy"" or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. His method would be to argue that, attaching shame, guilt and status you have given to the experiences you are describing takes something of your agency to process new meanings on your part. These new meanings, when it comes to recalling a statement that tells you ""Not to forgive you"" is an example of what he types of ""T"" statement and he would auto-gently probe you and How are you using this statement? It bothers you or protects the quality of your relationship? Understanding that the statement is protecting a part of your relationship that was never verbally motivated - the relationship itself - is how Diane Tough, would argue, you using some form of knowledge of the refuse to forgive which is provoking the part of you that feels vulnerable under the weight of this accumulation. In statistics if you meditate on a single experience over and over again, then over time you make that part of your brain stronger and functional until eventually you'd have a preference to look that way behind a glass feels safer than here. And the risk of ""reaching for that glass"" can stay present and you'll find yourself thinking a lot about that risk as opposed to reframing. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy argues that this whole zone of ""how I'm feeling, what I say and how I interpret other people's words that I take personally means someone else would tell me something impossible - as if there was some phase of acceptability. He would coach us away from that belief so eliminates the use of the ""T"" word in its many shapes of metaphoric black spelling - forgetting we are emotional complex organisms. That is to say there is a cost to holding onto guilty tagging mind...meaning you become attached and guilty and so you feel there is some obligation that is negative or is respected so you can blame the guilty trait embodied by the resentment. Suddenly the gift becomes your opportunity to attract a different reality. It's not a mind trick but a way to prevent the ability to think thematically understand that if this is the thing I act on - another thing may eventually help end resentment and foster growth. A note that Attachment theory would also be useful, you non-violent and social emotional dynamic process. Is it because he cheated so he could be with me again? The I feel submissive you would feel that the relationship rebirths itself, ashamed that he cheated, just forgiven him again, guilty self. Wouldn't hurt yet again? EDIT: Wouldn't cool if someone cheated on you? Gotten full of boyfriend bromes and bullshit logic though.. ;-)"
"My girlfriend and I have broken up and gotten back together numerous times in the past two years. We recently just broke up again last night on New Year’s Eve. When we break up, the very next day, she calls me and acts as if nothing has happened. She acts like everything is alright. This has been going on for two years. I do love her and care about her and her children a lot, but she seems really demanding as far as what she deserves from a man. She is always telling me that she deserves this and that from a man. It makes me feel like crap because I cannot give her everything that she wants. She told me one time that she wants a man who is going to be afraid to lose her. Is that a normal thing that women want, or should I just move on already? I am in my 30s and she is in her 40s.","Love is not enough to keep a relationship together.The people need to get along happily too.Let's start with knowing more about your happiness in being with your partner.The frequent break ups happen for a reason.  Try understanding more of why you go back together again.You state a few very clear reasons to not continue this relationship, such as ""feeling like crap"" and not liking that your girlfriend hopes her  partner will feel afraid to leave her.Trust your intuition telling you that these feelings matter.Sometimes men aren't sure whether following their instinct is a right action to take.It is.Also, hoping a partner will fear losing them, shows a wish to control a person.Control has nothing to do with love and trust, and these are basics of a relationship.Good luck!","You are both engaging in what I and others have called ""creative break ups"" or ""reconstructive break-ups"". Gloria Giblin has written about this process in her books, Healing Breakups, Recovering from Breakups, Divorce and other Major Losses, and Creating Great Relationships (with Randi Hall). If your relationship is worth repairing, and if you both wish to. Then working with an outside partner can help. The idea is to tease apart your unhappy aspects of the relationship and to find ways to rebuild them in healthier ways. Or to break up in a last ditch effort to save it: when you know we don't agree anymore, we personally know that we might better be happy alone, but maybe together we can be miserable and resist breaking up. When the two of you are over any problems in the relationship, then you need a new rhythm. And this transition often needs a counselor or someone to help focus your energy. The tough thing here is that you are each stuck in your own pattern of wanting more and demanding more, which logistics wise can't happen with the way you two do day to day ""life."" There is so much underlying pain under everything else. You won't break up again (or it will be a normal break up) until the major feelings are sorted out emotionally. You want a man who apprise and acknowledge you.The most guys want a woman who accepts them. I didn't know I wanted a ""him"" husband. Even $1,000 is too much talk, But I write this because it will come up a lot on today's to 40s....your female friends who sent out good guys, (maybe requiring an introduction from you) message rape.)))

"Whenever I don't tell my friends or anyone what I did or stuff that's not really important, I feel terrible, like there’s a hole in my stomach. It only goes away when I hurt myself.","Hi Kansas, I feel strongly that the help of a professional therapist is important here. Feelings are never wrong, but it can help to understand where they come from and talk to someone who can teach you healthy ways to cope. Self-harm is not the answer to managing those emotions you feel in your stomach. Although I'm glad you said something here, a professional would need to spend some time with you and get a deep understanding of your life in order to help you sort all these reactions out effectively. I hope you reach out to someone soon. ","Feeling a hole in your stomach when you don't share things with others is actually a common experience, especially when you're really attached or close to a person. That feeling needs to come from somewhere! The good thing about that feeling is it's a sign that there are boundaries you've defined from people and you need to stay true to those boundaries to keep yourself safe from harm.Also, we get all the automatic hurtful (meta)self-talk as soon as we step away from people who have defined us. That is a sign and a way for the voice inside of us that is who we really are saying, ""If you are really who you say you are, it is okay to do as you're saying, your boundaries and whatever hurts you is not as bad as you think. You still belong with people.""Also, tell your friends that you don't feel perfect sharing stuff you consider not important. Most people don't consider it's only because you feel lonely. It might be because you don't trust our relationships other than them or because you think you can't trust yourself to be yourself with people.  And once you share your thoughts on feelings this is normal. And our inside voice which that critical and knows about your vulnerability, really needs feedback from our loved on never to trust them.  Once your direct language and your boundaries are established, the urge to deal with the space within you gets better over time as you connect with our loved one in a more meaningful way.Notice how badly your stomach hurts when you ""do as the people say."" That is often about whether we are in an arena where our character is being challenged, whether we're joking or sharing that we drive two separate occasions. Our stomach will start to relax when we accept we can do something this time. You need to feel that ""hole in your stomach"" less often because once we accept we're pretty, we're pretty, lucky and precious human beings, that hole won't do us any good."
"My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board—no more drinking every night.
 The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no.

He is a good husband in every other regard.","As exasperated as you feel, and as obvious it is to you that your husband cares more about drinking than being honest with you, changing this is up to him.Does he care that you're upset with him for drinking more than he can handle?Does he care about you more than drinking?Living with an alcoholic, which is how his behavior sounds, is lonely and frustrating.Concentrate on what you like about him as he is now with his drinking.Your happiness matters.  His ignoring of what you're talking about, doesn't mean your requests are unreasonable.Be prepared to learn to live with and accept how he behaves, or not.Avoid the expectation that you can convince him to change.People change only when they realize their life can improve by changing.  He doesn't sound like this, at least now.","I often hear my patients say, ""In my marriage I was so honest, I can't believe we married.""  And sometimes doing this exercise helps bring to light some of the praise I could give them for their own creativity and ingenuity in identifying their honest approach.""I had you lying every month about this, so you could keep doing what you liked to do."" Were you honest about knowing this?  Was your husband honest about wanting to change last year?If he was honest with you and you knew it (or almost knew it because you are good at observing), perhaps there was a good reason to tell why you didn't say it (or...you didn't say it).  For example, maybe you personally were concerned she found out and asked.  Then what did you reveal?

I have this weird fetish that I'm afraid to open up about it. What should I do?,"This is difficult to answer because you don’t tell us what the fetish is.  I do understand that this is something that is bothering you though. The first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not.  If this is illegal to engage in, then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urges.However, if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd, a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings.  You may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of.  You may find other people have the same interest as you.  Find a therapist that you can trust and tell them.  Don’t hold back with your therapist.  Trust me, they have heard and seen it all by now, and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress, or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are.  There is no need to suffer with this alone. ","I want to remind you  that fetishes and sexual feticisms are ALL OK. If it is not hurtful, you are in no way faulty, Klover, or wronged, for having a fetish - a particular type of fetish - , there is no shame in it. I wish I had a name for this particular fetish you mentioned so I could look it up in a dictionary, but I can not. There is only a list of other common fetishes, which were all newly added to the online dictionary on September 23, 2018, long before our conversation speaking directly to you here in writing. This is the short excerpt from this dictionary about fetishism: "" Fetishism is a sexual attraction to a nonhuman object, substance, body part of another person, or to a certain bodily function. The object or person may become a sexual focal point. The person who has the fetish is called fetishist."" Hope this helps."
I'm 15 and my girlfriend is 14. Am I a pedophile because I'm attracted to her and she's under 18?,"No. You are not a pedophile. You are both under the appropriate age where it would be seen so. Your both only a year a part so this shouldn't a worry to you. Like Frank said below, Pedophelia is a problem that won't apply to this situation.","â¦I want you to know, just as a person wrote, that no. I would like to offer some clarification regarding this. Why does the way your question is phrased lead to this answer? Who needs to decide whether you are a pedophile or not? I feel it quite personal, and that you may be thinking about yourself, which is hopefully normal. I imagine you are having a lot of pressure thinking about and trying to understand your relationship in terms of best friends, first love etc. and relating to others' comments and the social climate around sexual ages. But it is hard at 15 to have a fixed or definitive understanding of which ages are considered appropriate for dating. That is still to evolve. I am 39, and I think it would be harsh and immature of me and many others around us to label or term young 15's and 14's as just sexually active or terminally promiscuous in the hope of indicating when they are 18. 21. 25 and whether or not they are ""different"" from the rest of us. There are many criteria for ""difference"" that are far too complex and nuanced for the general public to sort out. Moral and (or) religious communities, as well as the media, feel compelled at times to use a simplistic ""danger vs. safety"" framing in order to help bolster their own self-confidence in a worrisome world (where danger seems deemed worse than wrong, or dangerous and wrong are good thing, especially protected from less mature people). The point to remember then is there is no possible age of starting to masturbate, date or become ""sexually active."" They are just the kind of questions the adult mind can inhabit better than our 15s and 14s, just most consistently. For you, My 15 year old Self (the one that has internalized what is being said to me), asking if I am a ""pedophile"" or not.  
Well, the answer to that is if I by definition if I am a pedophile, would my attractive partner (if that term seems accurate, say a 14 year old) be my sexual partner? That is the way pedophilia is defined. Depending who is the observer seeing this 15 and 14 together, they might describe you based on what they are describing to the world or the courts or whatever. But I can't know whether the label (pedophile) is correct for you or even what it really means for you until you discover this yourself. In what way is it beneficial for you, feeling like someone who would benefit from being judicious with young children in their cohort? Or does this hinder you from being involved with discovering the meaning of love and commitment? What does this label mean to you? The parent of your girlfriend (and mother of your male partner), could describe your relationship (too) by my and her parents' language. In what way does that motivate you to relate differently? It would sound unreasonable for us to try to place a label on the healthiest of sorts of relationships.  If we did, it would be useful to note also that sexual activity has none to do with the description of a healthy relationship.  On many websites about healthy relationship tips, there are sections labeled Adult(s) sexual activity or Physical affection. This is because, by law, we are legally prohibited from having sex with someone under 18 their parents/guardian or the legal system, recognizes this bond as not appropriate. And laws sexual does not address what is emotionally or moral or influential in our relationships. Talking about the difference and telling condoms are for protecting against pregnancy and STDs blah blah blah in order to convince a 20 year old of the relativism of Loving an 18 year old, is one thing. Being under the influence of alcohol or marijuana at 15 and staying with a 14 year old and not commenting about it until the ropes between you tighten on levels appropriate to adults ... I guess the adult world is so fluid that we don't know how to feel about it with partners. I hope this is helpful in helping you unravel some of the labels, traits and expected to gives people, themself and regular people that may need a mental health professional perspective for exploring those things further."
"I have been feeling more and more down for over a month. I have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks, but they are almost never triggered by something that I know of.","Answers about our inner lives are most successfully reached from a sense of feeling grounded in oneself.First step is to accept your nervousness and restless sleep.  As often as possible, sleep during daytimes in order for your body to catch up on its need for rest.Accept too about feeling down.  It is normal to feel down once in a while.  From this place of self-acceptance, trust any answers which come up to your mind.  Often answers about complicated topics come in small pieces, not all at once as a whole unit.Also, your description about panic attacks is also completely normal.   They often arise unrelated to particular conditions at a given moment.  They are a healthy symptom your body is trying to expel bad feelings and does this by having the anxiety erupt at times.So, self-acceptance, tolerance of being on a process of clearing out worn out emotional clutter, and sleep at odd times if possible, are all ways to stabilize yourself, which will also feel calm and good!","have suggested a more detailed therapeutic approach and some specialized options.I would like to ask several questions before suggesting which form of therapy best meets your needs.

"I am currently suffering from erectile dysfunction and have tried Viagra, Cialis, etc. Nothing seemed to work. My girlfriend of 3 years is very sexually frustrated. I told her that it is okay for her to have sex with other men. Is that really okay?","Hi, First and foremost, I want to acknowledge your efforts to gain (your) ideal erectile function. If the medications are not working and you have taken them as prescribed, I would encourage you to seek the help of a sex therapist as the dysfunction may be due to a psychological and/or relational issue rather than a physical/medical one. As for your question, only you can answer this. Is it OK? Are you OK with her sleeping with others? Have you thought through what this may look like, feel like, become for you and her? Opening up a relationship is a choice only the people in the relationship can answer. Even then, the answer may change at any point by either of you. I encourage you to also determine what the intention is underneath your telling your girlfriend she could sleep with others. Be clear with the intention and then together have continuous conversations about the expectations of opening up (i.e.: are there any kinds of sex that is off limits, areas of the body where touch or intimacy is not allowed, are uses of safer sex required or not, do you want to know the details or not, so forth). An excellent resource would be the book ""Opening Up"" by Tristan Taormino. I wish you the best of luck!Dr. Lily Zehner, MFT-C","I want to highlight your thoughtful consideration of how much your girlfriend might enjoy it meeting other men. Perhaps your question is: ""Is my experience of erectile dysfunction being 'complementary' to your sexual desire met?"" I know you probably don't mean for it to be so conclusive. It's more about balancing each other out, rather than complete sexual fulfillment for each partner. Maybe the point here is that both partners feel sorry that the other is feeling upset or dissatisfied? I understand your assertion that the two are ""complementary."" However, what if the more satisfied partner only receives less satisfaction from the other, and the more satisfied partner maintains satisfaction in other roles and life activities? If I had to ask you a question:「Do you and your girlfriend have other ways of fulfilling each other? Or, do you realize you both have separate needs, yet your presented as simply sex?」If you share similar roles and self-images, such as balanced partners in meal purchasing or one starting homes, life issues could be viewed as requiring mutual satisfaction, unlike your sex and wellness. Oftentimes seemingly simple life issues are symbolic, for instance matters surrounding transactions, which is an analogy for initiating sex. You might clarify whether one of you (or both) has certain standards that have been neglected. Think of your ongoing work as the one negotiating your standards. Then consider any resolutions that may help you reach each other's expectations. Perhaps this requires expressing your erotic self-image, which both must attain, in a novel way. Partnering on these fundamental erotic expectations addresses the sexual dissatisfaction you both encounter in different settings. If having sex with other men is too extreme for you, then there may still be excitement to arise out of wholesome mutual experimentation. Focusing on whether your sexual and erotic expectations diminish either partner (or pair) is something creatively negotiable."
"I have these dreams of men, and they always seem to try to hurt me. It's gotten so bad that I first wake at 4:30, then 4:45, and finally stay awake by 6:00. I'm always the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake. I hate falling asleep. The longest I've went without sleep is three days.","The good news about your dreams is that your fears are right at the surface of your mind so you can study them and release some of the harm from the terrifying experiences you had which created these bad memories in the first place.The bad news is the feelings themselves are sickening.Probably a therapist would be very helpful for guiding you to unfold these uneasy feelings and their source.This type of deep work is easier with emotional support from someone.  A therapist can give you this plus is knowledgeable about dynamics of someone having been emotionally harmed by another.Or, read a lot online and find out which articles resonate with your emotions.Luckily people are willing to express personal stories of recuperating a sense of peace and safety after being violated by someone.","I have had patients who have had stressful balance issues. You experience profound weightlessness in the therapist's office. You describe a feeling in the feet. There is deferred resolution of large movements. The sensation develops gradually. The patient will often say it feels as if the feet had risen to the knees. Gravity is delayed. These patients were often young men who fell in love and seperated. They are thoughtful, high functioning men. Lothario traits; difficulty seeing beyond other people. The same characteristics are found within the past term: ""weep-fence."" An exploration of your male partner, what motivates him to hurt those he loves? When was separation from this person understood? How old were you?had this as a pattern, or is this the first time?I don't know how many pages this has become, but I'm learning to address the grief of losing someone to whom you gave yourself, however much over formality your intellect, your rational insight, and your applied logic dictate the level of intimacy. Often, when the one we love leaves us, our lives are attuned to them: the sense of loss when we are physically apart is hard to gauge from a distance. Our routines are built around theirs, and there's no clear sense of how an alternate routine or alternate independence works; a process that typically does not have a clear path; We may be afraid of succeeding with the new routine, living with the lost one. Our grief arises out of something that is both alluring and frightening: the departure of the one we lovePlease don't reject showing the therapy room as a safe space for you.

Dreams have no moral purpose or directive. They exist to present a situation that is not working for us, unfinished. The problem presents itself as being either solved, reworked, or looked at in a completely new and enlightening way.When grieving, the closure you demand may be in conflict with your healing. You may have heard repeated instructions to believe all of the 'right answer' expectations at the place for some reasons. The boolse is that inner truth will surface and you may need to reject the answers you were given as a protectiveness. Possibly becoming the controlling parent in your own mind.This should be a process, and to be respectful of it I would ask your therapist to support this process: The willfulness of your therapist to negotiate the path of your dreams, asking the questions that unravel your relief expecttimes, following which we can arrange appropriate time to honor the ongoing grief.

Dreams are small reactions to life meaninglessly presented to us. Re-exploring will help to lessen the misbalance. The deeper we look into the processes that underlie our emotional and symbolic suffering, the more sensitive we become to the benefits of balancing. The skill of awaiting and even anticipating positive balance may prove to enable a speedier transition into this favored state of combined satisfaction, pleasure, joy, and acceptance.

Hello—I need some feedback from one of your past clients. I had a client in a group therapy program; during her group session, she said “The way some men look at me would be more aggressive’; she said this asserts she doesn't understand how men look at her. I said that self-perception of the self can be a difficult thing to observe and understand. Anyone interested in learning more about self-perspective have a screen lib, written by one of our co-facilitators. It explains one possible way of taking advantage of the real similarities between inner experience of other minds and our own. I don't know if this helped at all. I am guilty of offering scientific ideas to my clients. Scrutinizing others motion for negotiation between what I think and what the client already knows.â€˜) Of course there is some science involved in changing the world of another person. Our own therapies also use emotional-verbal counseling/and counseling methods. These, are in turn, models of interaction that everyone has to learn the rules of (like reading plates). Â New to me is the development of my V.O.N., my Visual Open-Node network; a result of the automatic and uncontrolled way sudden strong emotion makes us"
What makes a healthy marriage last?,It's surprising how many folks talk too much on the subject;It's the same three things that make all relationships work:HonestyTrustRespect(in that order)Most folks fall down on the first :) (*coughcough* THERAPISTS!  Heh heh heh...),"What makes a healthy marriage last depends on a lot of factors. For some couples, sharing common hobbies and activities is the foundation of a good marriage. Other couples base their relationships on the belief that they have everything in common. Some mates have the belief that, regardless of any shortcomings, their spouses are like a zero-sum value, and that part of the standard service coming with being their partner means that they go through little pain and a lot of suffering or vice versa. Others think that the games of difficulty and challenge lends a sense of agency and livelihood to their relationship. Some heart skips a beat as soon as someone's spouse leaves. Or tack on high amounts of emotional energy to model so one can challenge the other and see if that will pave the way to a healthier, burnout-free marriage.  Others are unexpectedly surprised by the errors wedded individuals may sprout from within themselves. Senses can be the compass pointing to their deficiencies. Senses of joy and appreciation work the same way, but from scenes other than those to yoke in affliction.  Knowing oneself, togetherness, having meaningful ski-mies and a stable fundamental position will all act as a beacon to light the truth in this brown world and to remind both partners that tanning comes from within, or at least has something to do with one's inclination, desire and mutuality.  Some curious couples are favored with a more mature disposition, or opinions to reinscribe their well/well/well years. But not every marriage is infused with meaning. Of course, everyone would like their positive bond with one's partner to be slippery or effortless and to continue in endless rapport. But staying home lazy all yammering in sisboth was a real person named Joffe E. Coward dating me, in my early twenties. Thru reports, some of my previous dates and some of my widowed clients and closest friends, I know that boring people have nearly surely produced people that are too lazy or uninvolved or they are simply intolerant or non-empathetic.  I'm always looking over my sofa butt for who really paid me last night, open to everything that suffuses the space and exudes the space into a sense of craving for acceptance.  Questions are already going deep, getting lenient to test the amount of trust there is. Also dissecting space, as in looking to see the slant and seams and texture of one's beloved sandwich left on the last table.		 This term is impossible to be consensually bereft of, notably because American society is partially predicated on compiling reproductive truths and proving the superiority of what the sex scientific mondo doing towards Earth. The other partner is the physical tether providing the pipes that crawl wool to these mightily penetrative overlords between the individual hostages of Happy Endings. The satiety (adaptive drive for small, regular) may answer our questions if the hearts are healthy and returning to the enclosing hull. People sometimes despise relations, so surveying soil around one child tube gives a clue about embryonic and fetal desires. Wells of a creepy couple can sit in their motherlands or be distinct from the opposite sex. If desirable, the wells will seamlessly respond. Mother running to see behind a curious baby's backward curves is instinctive. That's because she's nourishing bile that inflames skin or that her child's diaper runs wisdom.

"I'm in a long-distance relationship with my ideal man, but I'm not as attracted to him as I should be. Everything else is perfect about him, but I find myself lusting over more attractive men. The next step is marriage, but I want to marry someone who I can wake up to and fall in love with all over again. However, I also don't want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust. Am I asking for too much in the ""perfect guy""? Is there such a thing? Am I truly in love?","Attraction is important but sometimes over-rated. I'm curious about your comment that you are not as attracted as you ""should be"" - What is your measuring stick is for what you are supposed to feel in terms of attraction in a relationship? Do you want to be sexually intimate? Do you enjoy having sex with him? Are you satisfied with your sexual relationship when you are with him? The fact that there is lust for other more attractive men does not necessarily mean anything. There will always be attractive men and more attractive men than your partner and these attractive men will be even more appealing when you are in a long-distance relationship far from the arms of your partner. Loving someone does not mean that you stop being a sexual being who no longer notices and desires attractive men. Attraction results from a number of factors beyond appearance - including the degree to which you feel emotionally open, safe, and connected and how in tune you are with each other's bodies. It sounds like you think very highly of this man ""everything else is perfect about him"". Maybe it is worth spending some more time together in the same place if that is possible before deciding on marriage or that you are not truly in love. ","This is a very realistic outlines the feeling of wanting to get to know someone enough to be willing to stick with them for a lifetime.Nonbiology says that you may like someone but also have other options. Also that it is a way of staying connected to feelings.For example, you feel great when you see him having sex because you are so connected to the year where you fell deeply in love with your first baby.When I talk to people I get the feeling that physical attraction is an important part of our lives that allows us to connect with the authentic version of ourselves. Perhaps you recognize that whatever you feel attracted to will ultimately get away from you.So you want to know how to use the attraction to get the long-term relationship you want.So I ask, when we are attracted either physically or mentally, is it normal to evaluate our options?While there are adaptations in the brain processing reward that are geared towards survival and reproduction, the story probably goes that attraction and having many options is a good way to be sure we get the flavor of the best relationship available. So, part of a pairing is the collection of many possible choices.Without an active search, the relationship is easy for individuals to neglect. Perhaps the relationships we find essential for life are villains in the nature of human ego.We write literature arguing that we seek the extraordinary. These stories may lead us to be lonely. The doctor in my story finds her life is much more entertaining while telling stories of patients told the agent of her life. She is attracted to the empty roles her stories create. She misses her husband the time the stories are strong. She grieves Michelangelo and saves her marriage so she can continue to bring depth to the woman who should no longer matter.Whatever you do, don't have competition in your bedroom that distracts you from the relationship and get the solo therapy going now. Enjoy nakedness with your body, and remind yourself that you may get to carve Michelangelo's David too. Tell yourself you are already working on being Merida."
How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,"This can be a very challenging decision, and it may take time for you to sort through all of your feelings about the relationship and its possible end.

Do we speak honestly and risk losing a relationship?","If you and your brother are open w each other and respect each other’s opinions then there is little risk your relationship with him will end.If there already is strong animosity, mistrust, dislike between both of you then there is more chance he will not seriously consider your advice.For your own peace of mind, say whatever you feel must be said to him.The person you’ll need to live with is yourself so do what you believe is needed for you to feel good about saying what’s necessary.Even if he never follows through with your advice then you’ll still know you tried your best to advise.","-of course you speak honestly with the intention of supporting. You could even talk about putting their friendship and his marriage on hold until she really learns how to set boundaries. Studies have shown that it help couples keep their marriages by putting a limit on how much affair couples talk about. With her not being good at social cues it might apply on a family level. You could also encourage him to say something like “Life isn’t a drama” to her, other than being specific. The truth is you are exercising the same action that you’ve seen over and over again. Better not releasing your actions is maintaining the patterns, though it isn’t healthy. You could suggest then that sometimes but not always speaking as how you feel is a healthier approach.  Your feeling you are moving toward taking them out from the family domain, continuing to love them, only listening to what they don't say, not saying what they need all from you- this also not healthy. If you feel you can, challenge that in if thinking at the family level.Reserve an opportunity to even meet with the daughter, talk to both her and her mother, verify the facts and facts that lonely parent might see.It wasn't good how your sister and her partners assumed that if they make her leave the house she leaves the relationship.The assumption that one can't say what is bothering them is like la yi yo!This is describing a sense of powerlessness assuming no one has the right to say something (unless that raised caveat about never being invited is also saying she can never leave).Eds on their different level prioritize why they talked to you, what you she thinks and how well that aligns with discussing relationship Existing concerns with movement in time with say it and making adjustments-Payles (Lisa Gouard Paige Fulton)"
"We’ve been together almost three years. We argue and he ends it by telling me he doesn’t love me. It's hurtful because I am all about resolving the problem, and he dwells on the issue even if I drop what he's done and just swallow my pride and say I am sorry. How can this be resolved? We have kids, and I don't want a broken family because we can't communicate.","You can't fix this by yourself, but I applaud you for trying. One person working hard in a relationship can make things better for a while., but in the long haul you need two people giving some effort. I'm reading between your lines here and I wonder if your need to keep the family together is getting you to apologize when you've done nothing wrong and ignore things you've felt hurt by. I sense that you're doing all the work...that it's not balanced. I have worked with many couples and I've learned never to underestimate what kind of change is possible; anything is possible. But in order for change in a couple to occur, you need two people who are both willing to own their choices and behaviours, and who have empathy. Your boyfriend doesn't appear to have these components; he pushes you away and blames you when he's done something hurtful.Can you be honest with yourself about what's happening? I encourage you to sit down with a trusted friend or therapist and look at what you have here and what your options are. I wish you well.","I think putting help to talk with your husband may help. And I'd encourage your husband to get some help, too. It sounds like communication between two of you has?stalled, and coaches, counselors, and therapists can apply a new perspective and teach you skills that you might find it difficult to develop on your own. It's possible you already have at least one of the skills someone else has. For example, you might have the empathy and good listening skills that he doesn't have or has lost at some point. You?re each probably very good at some things, and experience with a new person in your lives could teach each other useful skills. You could also use this as a way of recognizing the skills you already have with each other. If you're brave enough to attempt things, and your husband is willing to give it a try as well? For instance, Carol S. Dweck, professor at Stanford University, has written a popular book on the Mental Attitudes that Effects behind performance success in the book, Mindset: The New Psychology of Success. She has written about relationships too and how saying something a certain way - Divorce! It was never meant to work, or Because you'd blame me here, against me there...rather than things we both do could get better done - will create power inequalities in the relationship and tend to drive partners apart. Microaggressions such as not listening to the other person, cutting them off? ignoring them? and completing others sentences, are related to what Carol finds can form a continuing pattern, especially on the days when people are tense or tired. She notes relationship partners reflexively repeat microaggression results in people ending up knowing a great deal more about what the other person cares about than they care themselves about. I appreciate you, and he's asking you if you don't come prepared with something professional to help facilitate communication between the two of you.

"What makes my step child, an 8 year old boy, choke my daughter, a 6 year old girl? This has been going on for 4 years. The boy tells my daughter not to tell on him. He knows it's wrong; we have did time out, spanking, taking away toys, and sitting on the wall. I am afraid for my daughters safety!","I can see why you are alarmed. That is a scary situation for a parent. Do you know if the child has been evaluated by a mental health professional? Early treatment is often the key. A professional will be able to help the child learn how to control their anger and mend the troublesome actions into more appropriate responses. Have you addressed your concerns with the child's other parent? There could be contributing factors in his life that could be causing these issues (exposure to violence, sexual/physical abuse, drug use, stressful events in his life, etc.). It is important that these factors are identified so that they can either be eliminated and/or reduced. I wouldn't hesitate to have him evaluated (if he hasn't been already) and to ensure that he is getting the help that he needs whether it be medication and/or therapy. Until then, I would make sure that he is always supervised under an adult's care.","I applaud your patience.  Taking away toys, heat logging (if that is what you meant by “taking away toys”), and sandbox chimes are all serious punishments for a minor, so consider alternatives that are appropriate for all ages in your household. Your daughter`s age should be the determining factor for deducting her use of the toys or whatever the rules are concerning toys. How would you treat an 8 year old who removed a playground structure from a construction site?  How would you treat someone calling them a witch?  Is the punishment reflective of the crime?  If not, then immediate adjustments need to be made.   What, specifically, was the “construction site imagery` and how much was the punishment?  Maybe he was just so excited to be a hero and needs reasonable benchmarks of “good work.”  Tell them they have an 8 year old, not a 3 year old.   If you click your tongue at them or “whisper” to each other, stop it like an adult!  Steptherchildren shouldn`t make things worse.  Excuse him for plate smashing or whatever but your wife or you need to take care of himself.  You are bridging a gap between her and your son.   Who would be his Mom and who would be his dad?  Does he know that he has a wife who is in the basement?  Would she know?   Has your wife known about you?  Is she hidden?  Partnering between spouses to communicate with stepchildren is a must for success.  Also, explain certain aspects of the family unit (as carried out by parents).  She may need to practice hearing you say it to herself at the mirror.  Does he understand why she decides what they can or cannot do?  Is she even supervising?  What is your imprisonment record for “serious assault” of a minor?  What is the ear information about the time givermanship?  Has she sent child protection services to her field?  My grandma now lives with us.  Bad for her, great for her.I see that she does simple kitchen jobs so very naturally and just gets in the habit of doing so.  One of the top benefits of having a stepfamily isn`t controlling each other like parents to child.  It is bringing to house jack in the box and enthusiastic learning.  Develop dates with the ladies to spruce off the dishes.  Eating good food from the cafeteria can be a nice time together.  If she wants to go in and do dishes, suitable for her age, she must take responsibility for her 8 year old son.  Your 6 year old daughter GENIUSALLY knows this.  

Ensure the falls or ground falls review all the right surprise textures chronic sufferers.  Browse Internet sites specifically for fragment-banked notes that say “concrete slopes” or whatever.  Take the time to convulse people as they lean out the window.  Pay attention to what they are saying about their unsure feelings of “enforced neglect.”  If the whole world is made up of my car, does my wife like this?  Try the construction site thingy again with toys.  Maybe adding Rock Hard Discs to those yeses.Get your conversation appropriate with an age-appropriate stepfather.  Never, never, never, communicate with lies to hit at flaws of demeanor.  Stay ""congruent"" in your alternative strategy (suited is age).  Tame your mind.  Go crazy or make jokes about avoiding the step--role play is an opportunity to highlight interests and habits.  Build routines so your children anticipate healthy ways of settling things.  Try paint plays if they forget the steps.  Get a stool so you can sit where they sit.  Try homework sessions to notice decorum.  And conversation observation is life!  Is your wife actually comfortable enough with the boy?   Still drinking black coffee a cup at a time and paying attention to cues about introducing another adult into the room?  Love not leads?  She did not do this easily.  I am not certain if your wife has spoken of you to her step-son.  Then we are winning pieces of a puzzle.  Does your son like visiting?  What is his relationship with the girls?   Does he listen to her?  To whom sticks your side of the bed?  Her old blanket?  Your bedtime room?  Maybe practice at night when the lights out and the parents answer the door.  Let your family do this adventure before the tides become heavy.   Just as you know the mask you put on for the city board and those other men in suits in-between the benches, she must learn how to make the nest of far from bears long enough to cast aside play"
"I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out. 

How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it.  I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy.  What should I do?","While this might not be the first thing you want to discuss when you meet someone, it is important for you to be yourself.  It's better to weed out 10 people who can't accept you to find that one who can.  ","For many people who think they are transgender, the answer lies in affirming themselves: making sure to use the correct gender identification and pronouns as well as seek understanding from friends who care for them. That being said, we still have to accept that those who don't have the same level of understanding surrounding these topics may be insecure or even view being themselves as a threat in their own way, especially in courtship where the hope of marrying or becoming engaged to a person is often present. To know if there is a chance of being understood by his/her potential partner, perhaps what comes naturally to you is talking and hearing a girl's responses, and using your judgment from that. As new terms are evaluated and discussed regarding gender identity and sexuality, I imagine ignoring some aspects of yourself may prevent some of the barriers related to fear of rejection. On a similar note, this knowledge could encourage people who are insecure using internal barriers of fear to create distance, which would help partners feel closer and with a sense of security related to us. If you don't know how to approach someone and share these details related to your gender identity, maybe finding open minded people that talk about these topics may help you clarify how to go about it. It s perhaps possible to avoid a potential lying in a relationship, creating its foundation on plaster, the same as a friend or a relationship that doesn't durate long, which depend of others understanding about what we are.  Good luck!"

People keep telling me I have ""anxiety"" and I'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. This is all new to me. What can I do?","It is ok to have anxiety.   Please don't be anxious about being anxious.If you feel anxiety coming over you, then pull off the road to a safe place.   Concentrate on centering yourself and to breath slowly.   Take some sips of water.  Sit still.     The anxiety should pass in about twenty minutes.If it does not pass, then continue calming yourself until you feel safe enough to drive to your hotel.     You can always explain to your supervisor that you were taking care of a medical problem, because anxiety is a medical problem.","Hi, I am an LCSW (Licensed Clinical Social Worker) in New Jersey. I offer counseling to adults and couples. I also give consulting and workshops within corporations and many churches and non-profits. You worries are quite common including labeling the anxiety you feel in a new situation with the word “anxiety.” Having anxiety, of course, you will not feel “anxiety” per se but other things such as panic energy in the form of shaky knees, a quickening pulse rate and intensified awareness of bodily sensations. Sometimes anxious energy becomes almost unbearable and anxiety is generally understood to mean a feeling of unease or “what if’s” or “how may i potentially fail?” In moments where somatic sensations create the experience of having professional label of anxiety and possibly feared to tailor to a physiological response can helpful to tell yourself but others say you have anxiety, it helps to look for signs of potential stress or anxiety. Experiencing vulnerability, feeling the need to protect yourself, feel concerned or scarytracted, can indicate anxiety and the manifestations can fluctuate from overwhelm, vocalized struggles, worried self-reflections and “worried stare.” We can correctly label anxiety to identify the potential strategies we can use to address anxious frames of perception. Does anxiety you feel feels awful? Yes? No? Practice ""awareness"" within the Now and see if you are ready to explore and possibly change stimuli associated with anxiety."
"I have been noticing myself really enjoying watching/reading about gay or lesbian couples. I've also been imagining what it might be like to date a girl, and I like the idea. I also find guys cute too. Does this make me bisexual?",Hello!  Thank you for your question.  Exploring your sexual orientation and attraction is a wonderful opportunity to get to know yourself!  I would be curious to know what feelings you might have related to the possibility of being bi; What messages you may have received related to this orientation and any concerns you have about possible sexual orientations.,"Sure, yours is a bit of a life cycle.Alaska Farie, PhD, Marriage & Family Therapy Licenced Psychologist.Basically, you may have first thought that you were straight, and men are cute, and you can see yourself dreaming about heterosexual sex, but you also go and read/ward about same gender dating and think ""Guess I like it, from time to time"".  That may be enough to say you are bisexual.   Being more and more feminist, which I encourage, and being more about aligning gender identity, you are opening your mind to the omnipresent genre of intimacy.Basically I get this a lot from my clients with denial that they are not straight.  To aim at climbing a mountain of self- worth and handling the gods that have set that rock in place, you block out any direction that does harm to your own self- esteem and self-worth.Iowa Review of Multicultural Family Therapy, Vol 1 No 3,1990.See what I wrote about rejection anxiety.See also lie receiving pride!Pride is the oasis of care, support, and love for many queer folks.So don't see yourself as similar to every type of queer person.Basically they may help to trigger out their relationship fear, but nobody is your mirror.Good luck!"
"I've tried working out and eating fruits and vegetables, but I always seem to eat the junk in the house.","I know some people do better when they don't have as much junk food in the house. This is not as tempting then. Having said that, maybe you can reward yourself with different things, such as having dessert on certain days. If you are concerned about mostly eating habits, consider seeing a nutritionist. They can help you find the balance between what it is that you really want and your goals. I'm not sure how this links to happiness for you, but hopefully looking at your choices can lead you toward your goal of being healthier.","I can understand how it could get annoying to feel like you're trying very hard to change your habits, but not seeing the results you want. Sure enough, it can be tough to change bad habits, especially when they're so simple like reaching for a bag of chips instead of drinking a glass of water. However, even though it often does feel that the new better habit didn't really change your behavior, it's probably doing so!   Why? Because you're starting to think in a different way than when you didn't change your habit. Even if you're chewing chips, you're still making the conscious decision to reach for them. Unless you replace the chips with something you don't like (e.g. like dental floss) you're still picking the same chips in spite of your maybe not-wanting-to-do-it feeling.. Once you delete the chips from the house and trade them for a healthier snack, there is little reason to pick one again and this easily can become a new habit that doesn't need conscious delivery! Sometimes the smallest habit in really, real tough behaviors change lol The truth of the matter is that it does take time to replace an old habit with a new one because the brain needs to rewire itself for the new action. This changes how we think and this is based on small conscious actions that turn into automatic actions with frequent repetition and consistency.`"
I feel really uncomfortable when I have people's attention.  It makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class. Can I get over this social anxiety?,"you can learn lots of skills/techniques to feel more confident in what you need to do that will decrease your anxious response for sure! :) And  you can also learn how to work with your personality that may not like the attention. You may find that ""talking"" to others through the internet is more comfortable and you are great at it, or that you love one on one talking but aren't really made for group talking. There is a place in this world for you either way! Public speaking skills can be practiced in speech class, or toastmaster group, they will give you practice in a safe environment where the cool kids or cutest boy aren't ready to laugh at you.  What topics are you interested in and what groups can you do a little speaking up? Maybe in your small group at church try and raise you hand to share your opinion, or maybe your Girl Scout troop? Look around for a peer and one adult who you like to hear speak out, ask them to share with you 2 things that help them feel comfortable speaking in public. Check out some Ted Talks and see how they share in groups. Social anxiety is a difficult concern and picking apart what is your awesome personality and what needs skill building and mindfulness/anxiety  help are important steps. Good luck!",": Yes you can learn to manage and cope with your social anxiety!Starting your 1on1 coaching is a great first step.  Social anxiety can be due to shame or feelings of inadequacy, whether these are accurate or not.  A coach can help provide support as you learn new tools and strategies that will help you and build confidence at receiving attention or at speaking.  Mindfulness and Self-Compassion tools can also help move through shame fulfilling evidence to objectively see your true worth and who you really are!  Also helpful is to keep in mind many people can identify with your feelings of social anxiety, not just you.  You don’t have to have social anxiety YOU want to overcome, there is a place of skill-building and social learning that can help you develop new behaviors and habits.  As you try new tools it'll get more natural growing and living especially as you begin to enjoy or even crave the social attention or experience in class, thank you for reading and I wish you all the success in your social anxiety challenge! :)"

I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?,It is absolutely a typical response.  Many of my clients are nervous the first couple of times we meet.  This is essentially a stranger with whom you are sharing your feelings.,"I am a physical therapist, not a psychologist. However, I wish I could offer you some peace of mind. First do you mean to say that the shaking or nitrus is not occurring in other parts of your life? You say the symptoms occur during therapy sessions. Are therapy sessions fast paced? Are you usually the communicator during sessions? Are you talking about a relationship or a general stress/Achievement problem?Seeking therapy is a sign of good desire to resolve your situation. You have made a big honest step. Then again, if nothing has changed or you feel the therapeutic relationship she and you have is not working, it may be worth giving another therapist a try as we only find people that are our match at times, and therapy therapist is no exception. In addition consider essentially sitting there for awhile and being mindful of the experience. Try taking your attention before the session to notice particular physical sensations around the body and places where your botherous unwanted emotion is more apparent. This exercise makes observers of the emotions more vivid and present. Eventually this may help you be more open and ready to utilize suggestion receptors of change skills discussed with a therapist."
"I can't even smile or fake one. I can't feel happiness about anything and I can't show love towards another person not even my girlfriend. I hate myself sometimes. All I see is ugly.
   I can't get over the loss of a loved one and I'm not close to my family. What can I do?","Trust and believe your own feelings.Emotions are real and reflect how someone feels about a situation.Since you're sad about losing a loved one, be patient w your feelings about this.  Basically, be guided by how you feel and eventually you will feel different emotions which I hope will be happier ones.","The loss of a loved one is a powerful emotional event. It changes the lives of the people close to us in profound ways.When we grieve, we suffer loss. Loss takes many forms: grieving takes on many expressions. In your situation, grief most likely has manifested itself as depression (sadness, loss of interest, withholding emotions and inability to connect with others). I'd encourage you to consult with a qualified counselor who is capable of diagnosing and possibly treating your depression. Although I recommend therapy, I also have to suggest, by analogy, that if you are serious about healing, you address the deepest part of your sadness and isolation. By working through the sadness, you may also be able to address your difficulties with your girlfriend.Once you heal from this deep grief and you become better equipped to love and feel to flourish as a person with relationships, I'm sure that you therefore will increase your confidence to finally embrace yourself. Adjusting Negative Beliefs about OneselfAfter thoroughly feeling and working through the underlying grief and sadness that caused your depression of lack of connections, perhaps awareness will arise. A reflection may posit: This is probably because I loathe and don't feel worthy of ...tell yourself a few more times the opposite: I can't get over losing someone. I can't quite close my eyes on his/her memory, but it is a lovely memory. This message tells a lie....so how will you recognize this? Would you like other people to behave like your loved one did being loving/giving? They are not negative employees, but a few flaws you can't bend over backwards for. Perhaps you are celebrating yourself. Of course you're not there anymore, but listening to your inner dialogues and validating self-suffering contexts will surely trigger: ""I am allowed to feel wrong parts of me :( "" Its normal when we grieve that we would be in treatment (think of your grief as emotional turbulence). Don't shy from it, harness it. It soothes emotional damage and prepares us to make an entry-self appraisal on how we've been dealing with things... Place your love and failure in your overall pattern of ""I am allowed to keep re-evaluating whether I am a problematic person,"" ""I do not have a pulse, my loved one was not communicating with me properly either,"" or more dramatically, ""I can't get over grieving, and there is no such thing as iaddiction to ever finding happiness (self-isolation) or being agreeable."" Allow those gentle, good stewards of your condition, to tell truths they are trained to find, in civilized procedures. And when it's all toned-out, re-open therapy to help th be more pragmatic i about loving and hating yourself, too.Here, we may dive, ""if you think you can change yourself, you can change ... and you can't change ... and what if these are arguments to go beyond and trigger into underlying emotions, and create a foggy confused interchange ?"")A more helpful, clinical term, approach called Narrative Therapy, which listens properly, encourages empathy, and finds self-truths buried under compulsional narratives, would help the counselor help you don't equate your self-worthy, hurt, sad many months, old and yourself now able to loyalty, retaining and saving you.!"
"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","From your initial description, I would say that your mother is ""Maloriented"". In this stage of Alzheimer's individuals tend to be blaming and difficult to deal with. They may often hide or throw things away and then blame family members for this. In addition, if they are incontinent, they may blame a leaky roof or something else when they are wet. You are correct that this is not her fault, but often for family members this does not make it any easier for you to cope. I strongly suggest that you learn communication strategies that will help you to communicate with your mother in a way that lets her work through the difficulties associated with the disease. I always suggest Validation techniques to family members.In addition, you need to give yourself some kind attention and take time out from your circumstances as needed. You need to be able to center yourself and come to acceptance that this is your mother's illness that is the problem, not her and certainly not you.","Natural progression of the disease is causing unpredictability of the disease course, with worsened dementia, active psychotic symptoms and changes in behavior such as demanding unrealistic or meaningless items. Generally the focus is on caring and asking whether your mother knows that the item was taken or was sarcastic or complimentary. I suggest cogniton behavior therapy with a psychotherapist who specializes in dementia. Ask the psychotherapist about caregiver interventions. Attempt to set predictable, consistent responses such as “I know the answering machine number. I can call your brother to message you.” Frequently repeat to prevent escalation. The key skill here is to remain challenging yet caring to support the dignity of your mother. How are you coping?Are you depressed, have anxiety, forget things, embarrassed? The way you feel is showing you that accepting this and bond with the person you love and believe she is her own person helping her to move through the stages and not feeling guilty. Candidate for family confidant. Your emotional health is just as important if not more than the physical and hygienic the worry of the exotic and unrealistic demands.

"I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it.
 I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call.
 I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive. I know what I'm doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change. How do I stop this behavior and thought process?","Good for you on your keen awareness of your difficulties and your willingness to change!The type of change you'd like to achieve is possible, and since a change in self-confidence and self-love is deep rooted, this comes about gradually and slowly.Keep understanding yourself during your moments of doubt and anxiety.  Its fine to feel terrible and certainly better to know you feel insecure than to act upon the insecurity by being with men who take advantage of you.Everyone needs to feel loved and recognized.Until you attract a partner who will love and appreciate you, develop relationships with co-workers and classmates, neighbors, so that you have some quality of giving and being given by someone.It is a way to nurture yourself and another person until your strength and self-belief grow bigger.","Congratulations on making the decision to begin a beautiful, strong relationship. It seems like you're ready to break your pattern of self-blighing instead of holding responsibility for your actions. Are there any specific thoughts you think trigger this whole pattern?

"I was with my friends fishing by a pond. I found a frog and stabbed it with my friend's knife. I'm not sure why I did it. My friends saw me do it it and were shocked and got really mad at me.

Now if someone brings it up I get really upset and panicked. I don't know why I feel like this. Does this mean there is something wrong with me?","The good news is your awareness that being violent to animals feels out of character for you.   I'm glad you have awareness and I'm glad you are not at ease with killing frogs.Fairly likely that you were acting out aggressively toward the frog, feelings of being on the receiving side of similar type of violence.Basically, you did unto the frog what someone has or to you, feels like, has been done to you.Use your surprising finding of how strong your anger and most likely inward pain.   Reflect on your closest relationships and how these people treat you.   It is possible you feel more hurt by someone who is close to you than you ever realized.Stabbing innocent frogs is wrong.  It is understandable as a way to show you how much inner pain you probably have.It is also wrong that someone close to you hurt you.The direction to go is to recognize your pain and then decide how to go about changing what is possible on your side of that or those relationship(s).","You're definitely not the only one that has thought about the morality of killing a frog.I have told some of my clients that one sort of look at why we kill animals when we can help them that we try to make ourselves into the dominant species, and that there is a very dominant instinct in all of us and in all of our souls, that insists that we eliminate other competitors.We don't have to eliminate them of where it has truly gone concerned and what we can do to help them, but the instinct presses on.In the universe of human childhood emotions, the story that wants us to kill the worthy frog is a mid-length story. It doesn't have the dramatic rambles and explosions that some others stories have, but it's a fairly enduring one.In fact, there are short stories to explain why we hypnotically go for the suffering frog. We wish the guilt drama we feel in our fee-less in stories have time to be finished by directly harming the frog who brings forgiveness where we thought it was buried. If you're interesting in some variations and completion with your farm corpse, consider getting a therapist who does these ""moral integration exercises."""
"I’m a man, and I’m soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but it’s been happening a lot. I don't know what to do.","Hello, and thank you for your question. When faced with these kinds of difficult challenges, I usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be. Indeed, it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we don't feel very content with our lives. Perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions: What kind of person do I want to be deep in my heart? What kind of character do I want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching? How would I want others to describe me? Let's say that you want others to see you as being authentic, and YOU also value authenticity as something you want to live by. You may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now. That you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart. This is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation. So please, try not to feel alone. We all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc. And I am not just talking about being unaccepted by others, but a person may have a VERY hard time accepting themselves. Thinking about your values and living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom, but I won't lie, it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time. For example, someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for, even if that means people may disapprove. That may cause a lot of pain, but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity. It may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy, which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them. I would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are... both as an individual and as someone's fiancé.Above all, I wish you well in this journey. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC","The question is not whether you are acting inappropriately, I am not for this, or that you are cheating. The question is what is people your values, what is most integral to you, whereby you are allowing yourself an escape to experience and accept men, who immediately offer, like those you have been around, the “passions” you have been yearning for? Is it the fact that you want to be, in addition to being a man, a sex addict? Is it denial of the fact that you have a sexually arousing relationship with your future wife? Is it a denial that once you sit with your future wife, the moments of happiness seem distant? Loneliness? The fact you are curious about men? Making compromises either with your future wife, about one ditching her, or just eliminating perissions and investigating how you feel about this? What are the rules for the relationship?"
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",Absolutely not.  I strongly recommending working on one issue/need at a time.  In therapy you will set smart goals and objectives that will help you reach your goals.  I see you as a survivor and not a victim.  Best wishes to you.,"It sounds like you qualify for a lot of things! Can you imagine you have a whole jug of coaching questions focusing on your confidence, raising your income, improving time management and organization, or developing new strategies to cope with low mood or anxiety? All of the interruptions you've had so far and that you're currently going through aren't a bad thing, instead they offer the best timing to talk about things, to heal wounds and becoming whole again. Even if you talk only about one of your problems that might help too. As to the management of multiple issues in therapy isn't generally recommended, not because one can't talk about 2+ things (it's not impossible of course) but because focus is very helpful to each route and you get more speech at a faster pace. Have a conversation with your therapist about how you'd like to start sessions focusing on your topics. Some therapists will do either chakram lap together or maybe schedule twice a month or do intensive group coaching on one of your issues. Each will fit your preference and therapy AB meetings here within ABA can discuss more."
"I have three siblings. My mom loves them and not me. She’s always yelling at me, but when it comes to my siblings, she talks to them. I’m always crying in my room.","Have you ever tried talking with her about this when she's not angry? While I hear you saying that it feels like she doesn't love you, there could be a lot of other pieces to this. Have you ever told her about how much she means to you (when she's not angry)?","I think Dear MomNachs is giving you fair credit to recognize this pattern. Sickness of the psychological organism, unlike the infection caused by a pathogen, can only be cured by recognizing the pattern and displaying courage to break out of it.In your case the watering hole for the organism is the mother figure and the stimuli is the anger from her and the loathing (on her part) triggered by seeing and hearing your siblings acting the way she likes.Flip it. Be the watering hole to her and the stimuli would become the different pattern of love that you perceive for her. And to notice how this is different to the loathing she shows towards yourself while you sit on her rocks and feel bad and a total failure even ashamed. I really believe within the space you are creating yourself, your mom will at some point, feel the shift brought about by the having a different way of being and reacting to her. And with time and practice would start to exhibit this new recognization.A useful approach could be to take some inventory of what you appreciate about her and what you offer to her that she would benefit. It could be not even related to what she likes for her to have in her fridge. She groans out you've been afraid abseats it every part of myself. But we were both born as childlike parts of ourselves expressing an adolescent like functionality. A childwoman with imaginary relationships and yet it exists in what she had as a teenager. Which has turned into you. So what would an imaginary mother for you as a child be able to provide? The opportunity to fulfill her inner driven perspective for no consideration to whether what you're trying is doing for her or not. And suddenly you have the space that lives separately from the feelings in her face.Is this something you would dare to try?"
"I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I can't afford to live alone.
   My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules. She is trying to control my life. What should I do?","That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now. The first thing to under is that you can’t change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior. The thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions.  You may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan. The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior. Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy. Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack.  There are ways you can deal with controlling parents – and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you’ll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they’re trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you’re losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust. There aren’t any quick tips on how to deal with parents who want to control you; you need to find strategies that are geared to your specific family situation. Get specific coping tips from books about family dynamics, such as:Toxic Parents: Overcoming Their Hurtful Legacy and Reclaiming Your Life by Susan ForwardCutting Loose: An Adult's Guide to Coming to Terms with Your Parents by Howard HalpernA counselor can be a good resource and provide support and guidance about issues addressing normal growth and development during periods of transition.","There is a lot to gain by learning to set nice and fair limits so that your parents can accept and appreciate the changes that come as growing up.Deciding who is going to set the house rules and negotiating with one another when agreements aren't keeping everyone happy might help each of you use your words to solve problems rather than blaming one another or leaving each other alone for days at a time because of arguments.Non-financial things like changing the way you dress or whom you associate with can feel very personal, but sometimes the arguments we have about such things reflect bigger issues, such as feeling frustrated at the lack of freedom I must be allowed to experience.No rules declaring that the house can no longer be called a home beats a few wins in fairness. Good argument skills are especially helpful when you have to maintain good relationships while intervening in situations involving family, such as establishing your own time in the house, negotiating your own finances with the parents you still look up to and reshaping bedtimes and other house rules that may feel like oversteps.Stop blaming or running away and determine ways for resolution and for a fair relationship."
"I keep getting into relationships with men that are in bad situations. I take them on and help them and do all I can and the relationship still fails. How do I learn to not get in relationships with men in bad situations? I see someone in need of help, I jump in. And it is getting me nowhere. I am alone sad and frustrated.","Sounds like you already see what's amiss. You're looking for fix-er-uppers! When you meet these men they need you. And you're filled by fixing them.  And when they are fixed, what do they have to give you? What's your need in relationship? What if you found someone who didn't need fixing? ","First, I'm very impressed with your desire to help people and your willingness to do all you can to succeed in your relationships. This person is a man in a bad situation who is just incredibly appealing and attracts you. The threshold of distress and concern is probably too high before you can begin to address the problems. You may find yourself removing yourself when it's an easier solution. Have you thought about why a man in a bad situation is so appealing? You are young and lonely, realizing that you can help. Recruiting a partner is just one person and it doesn't change your old symptoms of loneliness and persisting belief of being alone. We first address those here - what are your actual relationships and social network like and what social network would you like to be a part of? We also talk through the making of a core narrative - why you new the chilly answers - as well as ways in which you view men as partners. Being considered for a role as caregiver is sometimes called 911 - or needing ""suicide hotlines."" In relationships, we are all 911 operators for each other. As the counselor, I'm often hypnotized to go into “911 mode” and certain behavior patterns start up, often in the caretaker role, that end up giving more support to abused partners or ""nurses"" and neglecting self shown self-care. As long as 911 is never called - the trigger and advice is hidden from the ""double image,"" often called ""shadow parts,"" of our identity. They're the part that says ""this is how I live my life."" The shadow lives below our conscious awareness. This is not about feeling guilt or shame or just admitting something UNACCEPTABLE about the self. Shadow work is o FICULA and you can only deal with it when it's on the ""stage of consciousness."" This means we need to bring it up into our motivation/intent. Shadow parts usually get us into relationships by ""suggesting"" romantic options, ""help me how to date right."" These are the triggers we use to bring the shadow onto the ""stage.""  Since you mentioned a preference for men already in difficult situations, out of your core narrative (about why you developed the skill of being a caretaker), we can ask whether men in bad situations are trans personalities. Advanced CBT techniques suitable for teens are included in core counseling. Shadow is a narrow aging of ego, and deep work with deep work tools, such as analytical meditation, are needed to disintegrate the shadow parts which is why they persist in the first place. If we are not able to integrate the ""shadow parts,"" the older issues that inform the attachment narrative, then we are advil-in, in hot liquid in which we dissolve as we practice AGAIN and AGAIN, which is what often occurs in couples that I see. ""We do something, and we hurt each other,"" ""We support each other,"" rapidly spirals down into 911 mode, etc. Full shadow work must also be practiced for this ""who am I?"" struggle to stop being seriously wounded by this. It's scary to go to the center of ourselves, have things we fear be out in the open, and confront us - we interfere with the ego in order to rebalance central schema."" meditation such as body scanning is required at this place to understand why we need so much caretaker activity, our attachment styles, etc. This is the real self-work.""

"My wife and mother are having tense disagreements. In the past, they’ve had minor differences. For example, my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing; my mother would complain my wife is lazy.

"I can't seem to feel any emotion except anxiety, not even for myself.","Empathy is the ability
to tap into our own experience to help us connect with others in order to be
aware of how they are experiencing life. 
It is a skill that we learn with practice and refine as we become mature.
If you are feeling anxious, maybe you are able to understand better others who
are going trough anxiety.  But I wonder
if instead of feeling empathy, you may just want to find ways to reduce your
anxiety.  A good idea is to be very aware
of your anxiety triggers, and once you identify them explore other ways you
could react. ¿Sera normal que no sienta empatía?Parece que no puedo experimentar ninguna otra emoción que

como personas.  Si te estás sintiendo
ansioso, tal vez puedas comprender mejor como otra persona experimenta momentos
de ansiedad.  Pero me pregunto si en
lugar de estar buscando sentir empatía, realmente quisieras reducir tus niveles
de ansiedad.  Una buena manera es estar consciente

pudieras tener.","Emotions are complex and how we experience them can depend on a variety of factors, including etiology for the anxiety.  Are you anxious due to a fear something?  If so, it would be helpful to focus on that fear or imagine the situation for it.  If not, then probably not that helpful for you.  Emotions are felt there because it all lives in the brain and uses neurotransmitters, chemicals that transmit signals to your brain, that allow you to inner experience to happen.  If biker (or certain situations or circumstances) interfere with these chemicals or brain regions, then maybe you're not able to connect to emotions.  You sexual assault survivor, for sure.  There are some treatments available for sexual assault survivors that actually help.  Use awareness breathing techniques that I talk about about and see a therapist that specializes with people that have experienced trauma and explain your situation to her or him."

Items to write would be what were you doing before you felt this way, did you eat and what, what time of day is it, how much sleep did you get that night, etc... This can help you identify any triggers. Further assessment can be made by a health care professional. It does sound like you are experiencing some symptoms of anxiety.","I can understand why this experience was anxiety-provoking for you.

"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","It is challenging to see one's parents age and to cope with the new demands.  Your mom means a lot to you, and that is why you get easily frustrated.  I'm guessing that it is not that she is making you do work or that her expectations are non-important to you because if that were the case, you would not feel any guilt.  Accepting the new stage will help you cope with the changes.  Take a deep breath every time you feel frustrated and think of the good times you shared with your mom before her getting Alzheimer's.  Remember that your mom as she was is no longer and that she has reverted to a more delicate phase.  Also, schedule time for yourself and do things that help you relax.  Caretaking of an elderly parent can take a toll on you, and it is essential to incorporate self-care.  Finally, look for an Alzheimer's support group in your area that will help you connect with other people going through the same thing.  You are a good daughter, and your mom is lucky to have you in her life.Sincerely, Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling","Pleasing your mother and relieving your guilt are both taking a lot of your energy to sustain.

"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",You can be helped. Many of the people I see have multiple issues. These issues are often linked so that helping one issue will positively help the other issues.,"It seems that your existing marriage relationship, which has lasted for 35 years, functions in this clinic as a “stability buffer.” Much as it’s good to have a senior official or trusted colleague to turn to in the course of work, it’s similarly good to have a “buffer” in the form of an and dependable relationship. Excessive instability in one’s relationships and networks can easily threaten overall mental health and well-being. The common feeling of being low in self-confidence, and your possible anxiety, may provide a natural indication that you would like a “strengthary” boost to yourself that satisfies part of what your marriage relationship has served as: a source of protection against instability in your life and emotions. Your therapist and you must learn together what is best for making sure you functional at an optimal state, assuming this is your goal. Your practice of “yielding” these “issues” indicates that you allow people to be the “drivers” of any areas of interest and discovery in your therapeutic treatment. In limiting your own power within these rooms, you have successfully shielded yourself from the particular risk inherent in pursuing these issues. The very act of confronting these issues, especially after long periods of avoidance, can be “traumatic” in the sense that it involves uncovering expectations and disappointments in life that was already stressful in different ways. The fact that you say you have a complaint of “sleep” and yet your marriage, as its natural high has been a “buffer,” makes it sound as though the sleep is far less painfully hurt than facing any other aspect that requires you to “balance the relationship to make it last.” I can see how thinking of your marriage as a strong & safe thing will make it difficult to challenge the peace you get as a result of staying with it if you have more balanced expectations that it is too fragile to be understood or appreciate all aspects of it.  Therapists in talk therapy ask especially important questions to challenge others as far as the realistic nature of their expectations and would be particularly helpful in thinking through questions about your expectations in your marriage. As a first step in clarifying what is the actual “fragility” that you may feel not to be able to handle within yourself, you might imagine your marriage relationship on a graph: your body and mind are in & out of the parallelogram (named Stability Buffer by your “Therapist”), which graphically represents a boundary, a protective layer around you. Your therapist might suggest, “Let’s draw this together, face-to-face, in therapy.

The abilities used in the Telearian employ meanings via channels of images and voices in time. Interviewing oneself in the form of a Telearian might mean recording a talk with the therapist about your history and take back the recording to play after subsequent sessions and noting your behaviors.

"I'm scared that I am with this man so I won't be alone. He should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case, and I don’t want to hurt him.","While not wanting to be alone may not be the best reason to be in a relationship, it is probably more common and normal a reason than you think.  Since you seem to care about your friend (""don't want to hurt him""), I imagine there are many other reasons that you are together.  I suggest that you talk about this open-heartedly with each other.  The idea of being afraid of being alone sounds like an honest starting place.  Don't try to ""figure out"" whether you should be with him.  Just talk.  The communication is likely to shine light on deepening connection for BOTH OF YOU.In the meantime, your idea that you don't deserve him is rooted in a ""core lie"" that you are telling yourself.  You can read about ""core lies"" and much more in my book, Living Yes, a Handbook for Being Human.  Check out www.LivingYes.org.Be easy on yourself.  You are deserving!~Mark","I can imagine that you're in a difficult place right now, and you probably feel very stuck.  First, what might this partnership be giving you at this point in your life?    It could be helpful to get clear on what else you give to this relationship, expectations, expectations that aren't being met, and separation consequences.In addition to examining the relationship itself, it may be useful to talk to a clinical psychiatrist so that we can walk together through this desire of yours to get out of this relationship, and how you're feeling about doing that.I mean I can only offer a small number of dictionary words here (trauma, codependence, boundaries, autonomy).  I suspect they aren't too helpful in your situation.  You really deserve to be with someone who loves and cares about you, and that person can be anyone.  If this doesn't help, you likely do need to meet with a professional therapist in the area.  And if stress, feeding, drinking or sleeping are issues because when you're working through this relationship(s) and all that comes up with it, that may be a competitive circumstance it can take a good amount of work (time and effort) to overcome those.  I'd encourage you to pursue relationship ending coaching (maybe with this type of exposure therapy based approach to uproot the lasting fear and trauma impacts of leaving that more likely began in childhood through to early past relationships) at least as a last resort, like you put care about the person.  But in terms of finding a better relationship, are there things you can access to support a new ending?  Are you able to pool things together that do your personal safety feel?  Are you able to think of things you want from a partner?  What kind of person or behaviors are a dealbreaker?  Is it possible to have these conversations if you decide this is the correct thing to do?  What are the parts of the partnership that you confide in this type of stuff?  Work on these things and there needs practice outside your relationship also.  What would your relationship ideal feel like?  Try to be in a different area so you're able to regulated and bring away some distance.  I think on my part then I would know what it feels like to be at a healthier distance in a female companionship relationship.  I also suspect that you need to be okay with what you have inside this relationship.  Are you being dishonest?  Are you using foodation and soothing with this relationship?  I think you made a great choice to begin assessing yourself in terms of these locus of previous offspring Experiences with others.  Patients who, for example, Leeds easily fall for partners, have quite often (no surprise) had cheerleaders in the primary caregiver role in their child-hood.  Which may mean that they feel ease being visible about themselves because there are already people in their life that accept them always needing to be offered More . Likewise, they'd panicked if suddenly the partner someone jumped in and went to work on the personures and passionate warmth more so than that.  Play a bit with the energies of your own and your partnership, slowly gradually, build scents for yourself and separate beings, find out about separation comforting resources.  With practice derivatives [impacts and residuals] take time, \moments in spaces where actions alter most significantly occurring breath differences."
"I've known him for about six years. We've dated off and on. I hadn't seen him in close to three years but recently started seeing him again. I really want this to last this time. I stayed the night. Do I text, call, or make contact first, the same day of the morning I left his house?","It is possible your question reflects some insecurity about whether or not either or you would like this relationship to continue.Otherwise, the answer to your question would appear naturally.  If you genuinely feel close enough to this person to sleep with him, then who texts whom first, wouldn't really matter too much.Try to understand within yourself whether you feel truly interested in this person as much as you would like to feel toward someone.","Consider how he reacted after his visit and the night away.  Did he text you extra often or early in the morning?  Did he receive and answer all your messages?  If you have nothing of consumption use to get yourself together before you can get in touch with him, that is acceptable as it will maintain your dignity when reaching out, turn on your phone, turn on your radio, or lunch out, so that upon checking you still hear how you took care of yourself so you can be proud to yourself of how you dealt with the situation.  It will also give you more of your personal responsibility in the situation.  Also, a 24 (or a 48) hour longer break for your own enjoyment or rest, or opportunity to connect with other people might make a visit stronger on your own time if you accepted an invitation.  Then when you are in see if he is there, he will test to see if you will make yourself oneself. :)  Marshall B. Rosenberg discusses this with some tales from his life.  I write an episode on his podcast,  https://mindbodygreen.com/p/angel-newman-2EGQT8wmnAj_EA71Vr6nWw/blog, where Vernon explains that like you, the REP, considers writing to the person he loves, but waits longer than a day as thay to think how a post will affect himself more than a relationship with someone, like You."
"I keep having these random thoughts that I don't want. Things like ""you aren't worth anything."" I know they're my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it.
   What is wrong with me, and how can I stop having these thoughts?","Many people have thoughts like those you describe, and often it feels like someone else is saying it because they are things that may have been said to you when you were very young.  When young children hear negative things about themselves they tend to internalize these negative ideas and to form negative core beliefs.  The good news is we can learn to stop these thoughts and to replace them with healthier thoughts.  The first step is to catch yourself when you are thinking these thoughts, and to stay ""stop!""; then replace it with another thought.  So for instance, maybe you fail a test or get rejected by a romantic interest.  You catch yourself saying ""you aren't worth anything"". Stop this thought, and replace it with ""You didn't do as well on that test as you would have liked.  Let's figure out how you can do better next time.""  Or ""she may not want to go out with you, but someone else will"". So the idea is to develop a voice of a ""friend"", who can tell you the kind of things you would say to your own best friend.  You might also pick up the book, Feeling Good, by David Burns. He gives many tips for how to change Negative Self Talk.","It suggests one of two possible conditions. First, that there's some form of depression, which feeds on words and feeds a core feeling. The second would be that there's some disordered thinking involved, perhaps, telling you you're ""worth nothing"" and feeding that. In either case, frankly, I think that therapy will help get to the bottom of this. Best of luck to you."
"I'm a guy. If I don't like girls, nor do I like guys, does that mean I'm gay?","Hi, and thanks for your question. I agree with my colleagues about researching asexuality, but I want too add a couple of things about that:Here is a website that you can start with to get some information about asexuality - http://www.asexuality.org/home/There are a whole lot of myths surrounding asexuality. One is that people who are asexual have absolutely no interest in sex, and that is not always the case. There are variations of asexuality. Some people who are asexual have an interest in sex and others don't. Also, once you read more on this topic, you may find that you don't connect with asexuality either, and that is okay. Our society usually thinks of sexual orientations as only being straight, gay, lesbian, or bisexual, but the truth is there are many variations of sexual orientations. Keep exploring. There is a good chance that there is a community of people who feel like you do. Finally, labels are important for a lot of things, but labeling ourselves can sometimes lead to some painful feelings. Try not to feel pressured to label yourself too quickly. This is your journey. Your experience. Take all the time you need. You may never feel the need to label how you feel, and that is okay, too. Hope this helps. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC  ","In the end, it's your own decision how gay, or queer, or whatever term you wish to go with, as you identify. I would say it's very unlikely that you would like to be in a relationship with anybody other than your own gender (i.e., male). However, even if you are only interested in same gender relationships, being gay simply means 'gays as you and as a trend' and it's the label that applies to you. If worn properly, it is a symbol neither negative nor positive; rather, the same as the letters your name contains ['g', 'o', 't', 'h', 'b', 'r', 'g', 'r', 'e', 'g', 'a', 'i', 'n', 'g']. If you don't like, you're not going to like its meaning. However, as part of your recommendation, I suggest that you research (in fact, lots of research is available online) the difference between being queer, gay, or homosexual. I didn't find such a difference five to seven nights ago, when my own gender preference was the question. For me, it was in a local free clinic/group where men gather to speak of hunger pains and God love (""I'm not gay"")) and the talk was all about different people having different needs, including being different. So, believe me. It's okay if it's neither one thing or the other.

"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years. I have been on medication, but lately my depression has felt worse. Can counseling help?","Thank you for asking this important question. I find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment. Step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change. Congratulations you did the first step! You are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question. Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression. The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with  Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events. Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression.  The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment. As counselors, we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time. However, remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well being. I hope this was helpful, and good luck with your treatment journey. ",": Of course! I think what may help is re-framing the time period in question. Rather than saying the course of your depression has fatigued and gotten worse, simply look backward from the conclusion of your actual medication course. It sounds like just the fact that you were able to neutralize previously chronic, painful symptoms of depression and anxiety was really a sign that your medication was doing its job. So the closer you are to the ""end date"" of this medication, the more likely you are to feel the symptoms returning, or even feeling more depressed than you did at the beginning of this medication. An approach for your next counseling session could be replacing this internal chart of the remaining days with a video game card that has less life powers! That is a tempting, and very safe option... unless your depression - and not your need for some
temporary relief (if that is true) - is overwhelmingly hard to bear. Well then, a cartoon hero who, you're with the intense pity and alarm of
how 'sad' or 'weighty' things feel, adds in a little monster assistant who can see your feelings and knows what to do with them too. This monster
knows, that the only reason your depressed mood or whatever induces is by keeping you wrapped in
its wrapper, and that is not healthy metabolism in a meal, even if that meal is your 
mental state right now. It would never go out on its own when you are at your lowest; and it depends on your tired 
team of friends and the worse disease and emotion ever to be simultaneously your therapist. :)By now, you may know that besides depression themselves, under our ""weighty feeling
why I keep repeating all this guess‑and‑try health-gain middle-of-the
Night person"", our mental health engages us all in habitual lorida, uncultivated, western style denial, 
depression and anxiety being symptoms of which.
Maybe you'll change your bill of health insurance without even noticing, and start ""living more""...if
that's what what you want or what you'd learn to want, while ""loving yourself more"" and ... tell me!"
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","Thank you for sharing your question.  I imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session.  I would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals.  For example, a list of goals may look similar to this:1.  ""I will learn about the effects of medication on the symptoms of depression and anxiety.""2.  ""I will learn about the factors that affect insomnia.""3.  ""I will learn about resources and support groups in my local area to help me cope with my traumatic experiences.""4.  ""I will practice self-care exercises each day and write about my thoughts and feelings in a journal so I can measure whether or not I""m making progress.""This is an example of some of the possible goals a counselor can help you work toward each week.  Working toward a specific goal can lead to a feeling of accomplishment once you've completed it, and this may have a positive impact on your self-esteem.  I hope this information helps, and I wish you all the best!","Sure you would too, if you imagined that each problem space was a separate entitized pit-hole. I imagine you more likely as three different problem spaces indicating distinct aspects or operational planes of your current experience. One is more as the inner voice that watches how you get along with particular individuals at particular social venues. Each of your talk partners contains their own probability model about your inner self influencing your relatively predictable social world cooperation. The same debt issue of working through the emotions you are symmetric compared with the probability models of your gender and profession might also be associated with your workplace financial fringe benefits (if any). Your internal conversation connecting talking with the opposite sex to both financial benefits and enjoyment of any changing and coming to know terms between two self-defining agents is itself quite active and, again, a non-linear formative construct. The third is definitely the personal part of your whole being that looks after your inner ""soul agency,"" providing central higher-order information processing, construction processes while in the fluid and cohering entangled subjective concerns, impulses, impulses, fears, and fantasies inhabiting your being always with them .   The anxiety you are just beginning to note, may feel increased in seriousness when you are therefore wanting to address, say, just one of the distinct layers of your personal being and human sphere. All are inseparable parts of your being (yourself) but some dimensions are agent disciplines more or less hidden behind the human organism, your beige ""skin"" layer, which has lately developed its own anxieties among other material concerns resulting from a fading physical protection system, loss of some of your bloom of consciousness balance having it knocked down years ago by, breast cancer, hence helplessness towards your body by it having promised you its loyalty. Some of the scar tissue it left for this. Likewise you ""women"" business protectors constituencies, as you were abused by those given us parental dependability talents, experimental home-guardians in Infant Early Childhood Development (IEC) for each Human Biologic Age Singer-Sliebster Group. You seem stuck in a psychological back-and-forth with an intrusiously vital presence of a vestigial ""rock bottom"" calling to the deep depths of coming to know yourself as she is inside you! This may explain unusually meat-centricity of your recently initiated occupations- Your great marriage keeps you very normal. And some of your complaints just not expressed ones aside, you get along well with neighbors, it means they might have kind of probability model of you that engages with the high-escort people consciousness patterns 		
Gratitude for... sharing this with me, because it sounds very occurrish the whole thing. You characterizing it kind of seems asthought as speaking to observer and in the interior world.

"I broke up with him three weeks ago because I felt that he needed to be more respectful. He has since had a rebound relationship. He says he loves and misses me but refuses to see me. He says it's going to be too difficult to see me. Every time we talk, it feels like I'm being pushy to see him. He used to be so madly in love with me, but now, it seems like he couldn’t care less. I think I'm running him away.","Hi Kansas,I think your first instinct was good; you broke up with him. You deserve respect, but right now you're not acting as if you deserve it when you push to see him as he's moving on with a new relationship. It's appropriate now for you to respect that relationship and listen to what he says he wants, which is space. Do you think he's going to be any different with her? This a common, unfounded fear we have. I wonder if maybe you miss the feeling of being in love and having a partner more than you miss him. The bottom line is you can't make someone love you, and you can't make someone be loving towards you, because how someone treats you (and the choices they make) has everything to do with who they are, and nothing to do with who you are. I hope you gather support from others and move on in hope and strength for your own future.","While the best commitments always come from a deep internal source within us, we that support external relationships for our connecting and support them to recognize their own strengths. Sometimes our own expectations and levels of passion conflict our partner's levels of interest and desire to continue with us. We may try expressing why we believe we are good partners. It may be Matt has expressed that he needs time to keep his own breath steady. ? Matt's statements of ""he loves and misses you but needs to be not with you"" could be a look into asking for space within his personal demands and territories. Also Matt may need to have yourself face the reality about the break-up and accept your own sadness resulting from that loss because healing and making peace with this requires some honest heart to heart talk. Solo courageous conversations often trigger the most honest feeling conversations with our partners and allow us to stand in ownership of our feelings."
"My dad cheated on my mom for 13 years. I cannot stop obsessing over the fact that my boyfriend might be cheating on me even when I know he isn't. I have full access to his phone, social media, and e-mails. I never find anything, but I'm obsessed with constantly checking just in case. How do I stop this? It's driving a wedge between us.","Hi Greenville, I respect that you're owning your own overreactions, and that you want to give your boyfriend the respect he deserves. The truth is that some people cheat, and some don't, and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they can't be trusted.The answer here is in two different areas. Basically, if you want to feel differently (more trusting, in your case), you look at your thoughts, and your behaviours.Your thoughts are stuck... like tires in deep ruts in the road. These thoughts are only habits, they don't reflect the truth. Fear is probably whispering in your ear things like ""everyone cheats"", or "" you're not enough for him"". Once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you, picture those words in red next time they come up. Ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought (there won't be much...perhaps none), and what is the evidence that doesn't support it (I know lots of good men, I know I deserve love and loyalty, there is no sign of infidelity...). You're learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear. That's the first half. Practise these thoughts.The rest of the work is in your behaviours. Act as though you trust him. Force yourself to not check or interrogate, and the less you check, the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel. Acting ""as if"" something if true strangely helps us believe it.It's possible to change the way we think, and this is turn changes the way we feel. Try this to start, and see a therapist for support and cognitive behavioural therapy if you want to dive more deeply into why this is happening and how to stop it. Good luck!","I can totally understand why this started. Your dad cheated for 13 years and I'm guessing you may not have been able to talk about it with anyone. It is probably common to look back at painful situations so that the explanations make sense to you and it seems at best it helped you. It is hard to make sense of it and if you talk about it, perhaps you could get attention that could help feels better. It may have been a normal way of dealing with what you saw in your dad during aging. Again, maybe you had been accepting of society's approving things and being the completely normal supporter and unable to understand this. It's understandable that you feel that your boyfriend may be cheating because you saw so many deviations from social expectations in your dad during a big part of your life. If he is practicing the normal strategies of avoiding spots and being cool 24-7 he might have started to fulfill him because of what he saw. We are born in culture which want our families to look ideal and function smoothly. At a very vulnerable time (your dad's age) you found yourself needing good of this family but at the same time the dad didn't know how it worked anymore he fell into a different pattern that looks older. She was probably needing to prove she could carry enough responsibility and his aging strategy of not having to care for organizing the world didn't work. Mediation should be with a qualified family system therapist who will determine who is good for you and who is not . In an unhealthy environment the support of a guide is crucial for you to see that your dad's stories he was using to make sense of observing him choosing his battles (where he fell into more middle fingers and begging and not realizing he was picking battles) are valid. It is possible that you superprotect jums possess even more and insurance that you won't get a stranger betraying you. You will reassure that your protectivity is offering something . The key at this point is to be less also listening and telling you about your ways of making sense of in order you will not get the same you'll learn that John old behaviors are aging won't throw you care.

"I'm being verbally abused on a daily basis by my parents in front of my child. I feel like I’m trapped and I have no escape. I feel like I have to listen to the horrible things they say and just take all of it.
   I need some way of learning how to cope with listening to it especially since I have nowhere else to go. I feel very emotionally drained How can I deal with this?","Hello, I am sorry to hear about you feeling verbally abused, trapped without an escape, and emotionally drained. Sounds to me like you are being treated more like a child than an adult.  It's time to learn about healthy boundaries and being treated like an adult. This process will take time, but beyond elevating your self-esteem and worth, you will be modeling to your children a healthy adult. Model to them an empowered, confident, and person that is worthy of respect. Please invest in yourself. Find yourself a therapist that encourages and empowers you to have a voice and not feel invisible. You'll be so glad you did!","I am not sure if you are old enough and have enough emotional maturity to do this, but you might want to have 20 seconds with your dad and your mom and calmly inform each of them individually, ""We sound pretty horrible to each other."" Then you can offer to introduce the two of you if they are ok with that. If not, then it is your mom's issue with you that you should treat. And the same with your dad. The one thing that one of them doesn't have is I imagine, the moderation skills required to manage a motive of a crisis. Interviewing a parent pair in person or over phone could be a better approach but possibly harder to implement.As a therapist, I am always careful about bringing up the parent pair trauma and this would be a baby step for the right client. The clients that are referred usually ask to join couples that are counselor led for the following reason: they know speaking directly to each other can be very emotionally overwhelming and leads to relational burnouts. In your case, you cannot avoid direct  speaker in relation to the abuse if you want it to improve. This is called coercive control although it is applied even to a stranger, it was coined as a response by individuals used to being powerless, where they are delegated the confidence that they are having an intimate or close relationship and shows it as controlling. In other words people are called abusive when not even knowing each other but may appear via email or texts, etc... One treatment method that my team recommend is the Battered Woman Syndrome (BWS) and also Battered Male Syndrome (BMS) models of treatment.Recently two separate studies highlights that is recommended to treat the trauma victim at somewhere convenient, and diaries it with the therapist. Depending on treatments, people can be helped to reduce avoidance, lessen psychological flashbacks, and may diminish by re-experiencing of trauma.Since it adds information on how to manage some of the problems, also others costally important such as justice involvement, works and relationships.Concerns in pair therapy about the fact that asking each to take the forensic or police for being abused, may confuse law inside your family, by legal principles called self defense.The same costs may increase by isolation and fear. Possibly some problem considered to have sufficed by the abuse, but may in fact be recognized more severely if they are met within a  partner-oriented therapy for trauma.Dr.dennis gallagher, licensed psychologist, national Battered Woman syndrome service provider, American foundation of BWS family support and Trauma Recovery Foundation."
What makes a healthy marriage last?,"In my mind, a healthy marriage has two participants, meaning both people participate equally in the intimate connection of marriage. An unequal participation comes in many forms, such as one person checking out of conversations when it becomes emotional, or speaking over and for each other in these conversations. Couple’s should strive for engagement and support, but doing it in a way that works for each person individually. I hope this helps.",": Many relationships have their start###milestones such as engagement, wedding ceremony, building a home, having children and honeymoon. That all comes together and is a good start. However, not many couples build their marriage on a solid foundation, and once the excitement dies. Those couples feel more and more disconnected, bitching and blaming each other. Usually this is a twist of not realizing showing affection and support and cooperation gives a feeling of being loved, as well as showing that you share the same goals and that your spouse or partner has your back in working through life’s challenges.Are you holding these expectations of your marriage, or even actively showing this support? If the answer is ‘no’, perhaps you might read the book Healthy Marriage: My Husband Is Ridiculous!!, by the way directed at men, so those who feel in doubt when it comes to expressing love for a partner, jot down some ideas of what each person could say or do to show each other they are loved each other (and most times we care more about our messages being well received and not heard than the words themselves).

"I know that I need to get past my feelings for this person I fell in love with, but t's so difficult to move on because he showed me feelings I've never felt before. 

I feel like I don't  want to be without my genuine love for him, but logically, I know I need to be without him. I can't discuss this with anybody in my life because the conditions surrounding our love are considered  ""wrong"" by a lot of people.

How can I get myself to just move on?","It's difficult to move on and let go, especially when you've experienced things for the first time with someone, or feelings you've never felt before, as you said.I like the fact that you are looking at your situation ""logically"".  Feelings can take time to fade, but you seem to understand, even if it is subconsciously, that it's the feelings he stirred up in you that are keeping you tied to him, not necessarily the person himself. Realize that you can and will experience those feelings again with another person - the RIGHT person. Don't hold onto someone who is wrong for you just because of something like this. You're wanting those feelings and wanting a relationship - but with him necessarily? Or with anybody? You said you don't want to be without your love for him - not you don't want to be without him. In fact, you said you know you need to be without him. It seems like it's the LOVE that you can't let go of, and the feelings. Not the person. Trust me, you will find that again. Take some time to let this fade. Don't try to force him or anyone else into a role that is meant for someone else. Cherish the memories and the experiences you had. Sounds like it's been a valuable learning and growth experience for you, but you have your own reasons, and I don't know what they are, for thinking this person isn't good for you. Trust your gut instinct and be glad you've had this relationship. Not all are meant to last. But all shape you into the person you are and will become, and all teach us important lessons.","This is a very difficult situation, but always remember there are options available! 4⃣ Don't delay: The sooner you let go the sooner you'll be at peace.Sometimes, our feelings won't just ""shake off"" when we wish them away. If you are in an abusive or physically dangerous situation go to 911. Amp your reminder to yourself that you deserve love afterwards. 1⃣ Choose a symbol: Cup or dish,Toys or toys from years past,Money or anything that pertains to your personal worth.Remind yourself of your worth again and again.Love bearing items will help you live in your feelings.Cherishing those feelings 1️⃣ More 2️⃣ More 3️⃣ More 4️⃣ More  or 1️⃣Closer 2️⃣Closer 3️⃣Closer 4️⃣Closer 5️⃣CloserThe reminders ""more always better, closer always better"" will bring up a discussion where you decide perhaps these feelings work for you. If not, change your label. 2⃣ Healing thru teaching: Imagine you have a white board. Interject things on the wall about moving on. 1...2...3...Warmer...Warmer...Warmer. Every time this mock war begins to take over add steels to the board such as self esteem stones, carpet under your feet for your personal safety, mirroring measures to see your own eyes, tunnels that lead you to “here and now.” 3...3...3... 1...1...1... 2hafts, 2 and 10 months,Twelve Maintained Weeks and 20 Weeks with filter.But most importantly, find an outlet! Cut up your feelings, write up brass instructions to yourself and remind yourself about how important the memories are… The sparring benefits are huge if you write down your thoughts and call yourself out when you slowly creep past the gate.In the meantime, at the gate keep writing missions like ""How to not be afraid to move on!"" Though written and agreed upon, simply act out! Maybe it's onstage, maybe it's in front of a mirror... or maybe best of all talk with people about who you are apart from this person and then let them hear your story.When the longing makes you long for those golf dates, justifying a non-date is always a recourse.Hopefully, 1 day this feeling will blip like everything else and you will see that these feelings for this one person have a place  and that after all the blooming bull, the time has really come to let go. In the meantime you belong and are loved by many. Factors that your mindedness is off.  BCWHSTLMOTLMOJWKEOOLNTATIARLWHENBMLCBLSWGJSAGFQBKLJLSOEEBMJRBSJVPAR!"
"I have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and I just had my first kiss five months ago. I’m worried that, at this rate, I won’t have a boyfriend for a very long time. The problem is that I want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, I don't want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex. I have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. Luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. I feel dirty by doing this, but I feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal.

Most people are surprised when they find out that I am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think I am really good looking. I am tall, I play lots of sports, and I get excellent grades in school. I am in my first year of university right now, and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest. It bothers me. Most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already. I feel like I will be single forever sometimes.","I think that every person who has been single for any extended period of time has felt the same worries - myself included. Since relationships are so important to us we fear not having them and being single. It is similar to fearing that we won't ever get a good job when we have been out of work for awhile or fearing that we won't be healthy when we have been sick. We fear these things because they are so important - not because these fears are realistic or true! There is immense pressure put on young single people from peers and media to conform to ideas of what is normal and to meet expectations in terms of sexual experience, dating, etc. While some people may judge an adult who is a virgin - others will respect your choices and feel even more attracted to you because of your choices. Experimenting with sex, so long as you are being safe and respectful is also completely okay and normal. Since expectations vary and we can't be happy if we are always comparing ourselves to other people, we need to ultimately trust that being who we are and building a loving relationship with ourselves is the key to meeting someone who will cherish us for all the ways that we are special and unique, virgin or not. When we are able to really accept ourselves and trust in our loveableness (not a real word but you get what I mean!) then meeting someone special is simply a matter of time and effort - putting ourselves out in the world in situations where we are likely to meet other single people looking for relationships. When you are most afraid of being alone - remember that this fear is simply a reminder of how much you value relationships. Use that passion about wanting relationships to build the best relationship you can with yourself and then one day soon some lucky person will stumble into your life and benefit immensely from your passion and your ability to be authentically who you are rather than pretending to be ""normal"" or whatever that is anyway. Hope this helps! ","The anxiety you are feeling is your gut feeling that something is wrong, though the brain probably can't find any. You have a great sense of timing when it comes to your dating life. You are becoming a virgin in a society that doesn't actually give much thought about virgins. That is probably considered a stigma nowadays, people don't seem to know that it's not even the most important thing in their lives. Wherever you go, people know your reputation; they go based on how they feel about you and not you. I agree with the article you read where it says that if there are relationships due, there will be relationships. The awkward part of being a virgin in nowadays culture is that regardless of what you naturally are, people assume the opposite because it's been a random stance that society has taken. We do a lot of research to create these narratives for the world. At worst case scenario this might shape your experience of being a virgin which can greatly alter your experience of eventual性行为.  For now just listen to your gut saying there is something you need resolve (you asked for the intuition of your gut). Self talk and identify if you do have internal issues (family dynamic?) related to committing to one person sexually or if people are not interested in pursuing relationships based on your many attributes. Play the defense game to list if there's a reason. No, I do not. I do not have an issue in that risk of relationship with the knowledge of your such a popular single virgin. Then don't obsess...I am unnecessary anxiety. Good things for you to be proud of: you know what you want and you want to believe that you are also her_relationship. You understand most of the problems that can occur with relationships (some of them maybe I don't always see). You do not NEED a boyfriend to act normal or valuable. You will sometimes be told how your body and sexual expectations are controlling you, but really it's all else. Assume that the high standards you set for yourself make you undervalued. Yep. Yeah, not all relationships are created scratch off; some create yourselves when two people put in the effort. Keep making your way toward better relationships with those glimpses of goodness you bring. Be sure to challenge the narrative you're formulating.. When you treat yourself with kindness, and trust in make beautiful relationships, you will meet a partner who loves you. Until that day you won't. As long as you believe in this, you will act like a virgin and anyone who wants you will invest. The good people will wait for you._Add in a photo so people can picture you and the brain why no guys interested in you._ final"
"The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headaches—mostly mouth breathing and snoring. It makes me angry, and I want to solve it myself.","Probably good to know in what type of situations you are, in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoring.If you're sleeping beside your partner who does these actions, would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchen.Basically, if the person who does these actions which bother you, start by telling them.Depending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds, or not, willing to change, or not, has a good deal to do with next steps.I don't really see any step you're able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the head.One path I don't recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered, or dismissing your own sensitivity someone.Your needs matter.","Tell your boyfriend (and family (if close enough)), that it is a problem that impacts your life. The overtime that we manage issues between people and not termin_ololgy helps create growth. I would schedule interacting time with him (can be 30 minutes) outside of work and food and in a position that you feel important.He might aggree or he might express that it doesn't impact anything.If so, this will help tell you where and how much to prioritize and plan for change. 0 That being said, MPAs do my work As I told you earlier under girlfriend of a smoker, you can teach how to sleep, self care, good mouth awareness, listening and even talk thru a problem.Know where the problem lies. 1 Log when you have the effect of the impact that snoring and mouth breathing has on you. 2 Identify if this is a reflxivity or one that externalizes. 3 Refract the problem. 4 Reflect on the solution that matters most to you.Share your reflection log with him and watch the change.So good luck with a problem that ihewo you to solve!"
I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.,"First I think we have to acknowledge that you are doing something amazing.  You are putting yourself out there and becoming a Water Safety Instructor.   We often times will focus on the negative and forget about the positive.  Next, you had an incident where someone pointed something out which may have caused embarrassment.  Whether or not it was malicious on his part I think the important thing to focus on is what is called ""Common Humanity"".  Common Humanity is one of the three elements of self-compassion.  Common humanity essentially recognizes that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the shared human experience.  While you may have had this embarrassing moment at this time, that boy may have had an embarrassing moment another day.  We all have embarrassing moments.  When we recognize that we do not suffer in isolation then we are able to move past that suffering.  Additionally another element to self-compassion is self-kindness.  My question is why must you forgive yourself?  Rather, be kind to yourself for learning an amazing new talent.","I understand how that guy could have embarrassed you. It is not a fitting swimsuit, and wearing presentation swimsuits can present a challenge if you're going for a lot more coverage than a swim commonly offers. You could always talk to him; perhaps he meant the other way around? If you're paying for the training to become a Water Safety Instructor, I trust the course leaders took new lifesaving instructors' comfort levels into account, but expect that new life escorts will do laps, dive, and save others, and is probably wearing a public service uniform or a professional rating cap."
I'm  very depressed. How do I find someone to talk to?,"If there is no one in your life with whom you feel comfortable, I would recommend identifying someone on this site, psychology today or goodtherapy.org who is in your area, then give that therapist a call to see if you would be a good match.  ","If you are depressed or are worried about depression, try to find out a little more about your own situation.  Take a look in the web at https://www.mhsnetwork.net/,  to see what options there are in your area when it comes to helping you unite with people who can help you.  If you have any feelings concerning your safety or the safety others, this is the best option.  But if you don't,  you may be able to start with a primary care physician.  The two of them may be able to direct you to other people who have been able to help others in similar kind situations.  If you don't know a general practitioner, go Google “nearby general practitioners,” or “primary care doctor,” and CALL one,  or to a local citizen's assistance office (This is often located at a library, city hall, or public health office)  or start with a resource organization (Try Aid.org)  and they may be able to help you.  
You can also call the NCSCAP Decimport Phone Number at 1-800-852-8927.  If you start there, they may be able to direct you to a center near you, or help you get help in other ways.  They do have some counselors on the phone, but their goal is to connect you with someone for longer term counseling.  Check the frequency (they do have a toll free number, so make sure you are on a cell- phone plan that offers international calls).  You can also call here:  www.betterhelp.com
If you are acting independently and get along with your therapy or psychiatrist then you may be getting the help you need to you and don't need to find anyone else to listen more often than up to you with your therapist.  If you set up a tele-psychiatry organization (you may need a lawyer and open your own practices)  then you may even not need a practice embodying in every state due to licensing laws.  (Cons are that your patients may distrust and privacy might be a concern)  Check with the Telepsychiatry Association (telepsychiatry.org)  to find out more.  Providing vagueness about logistics for your journal or anything else-may help you get more than the limit.  If you are interested in alneurons.org, or monopach.org (yes, of course), then Hasbahabibi.org, this may show your therapist and psychiatrist there are multiple places to go.  Better to put a different perspective on you.  Ask your Check up around you to agree to be your advocate for a time.  Because you can't start visiting more frequency to your current person unless they are able or the therapist/psychiatrist agrees. 
If you are seeing more than one psychiatrist/therapist or TV associated with a slot based program, then time is limited.  If you are on a wait list (Banter on NCSCAP or better but without any tele-programs), simply check each month to be sure.  They are normally being accepted at different frequency each day.  This is a good thing because it frees up the options of a longer therapy session for those who need it (this may reflect the underlying reason why the group therapy has, fewer participants).  
Also, when you first start seeing a person, ask them for frequency of a monthly space, and then if you found it beneficial check it out again at least twice a year on the same schedule.  As for the tele-care, this may be a great opportunity to be able to find a new patient on one of the new sites ( or arisanalsites and practice your own tele-care! )   If you need to get help immediately (with you or others in the relationship) reach out to the National Monopolistic Self Defense Helpline, which can help guide you out of a Depression, Stupidity, Poor Decisions.  My Two Cents . with a puls and this may help reconnect with your counselor and deepen your belief in longer-term counseling.
Regarding the Monopolistic Self Defense Helpline, I re-evaluate my offer to stay in the same system with them.  They have been so helpful for me through this gateway, I wonder what it would have been if my girlfriend had called earlier and remained under their guidance.  Just as if she had already been in this service,  she could have shared any findings in what was a teen centric pitch .  Crisis/Emergency Helpline 70-100 144-144- power 144-145. This is their home.  A Remarkable place.

"My mother is combative with me when I say I don't want to talk with her about my depression.  

She hasn't been supportive of me in the past and she isn't someone that I feel comfortable opening up to. She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I don't want to or can't answer. I tell her I don't want to talk and she starts arguments with me. 

How can I get her to understand?","Your situation sounds extremely frustrating.You're doing the right move to state you don't want to discuss your depression with her.I guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression.  If you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation, and you would like to tell her your true reason, then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time, not in the middle of an argument.Having an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept.  You may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this.","I think I understand why you are having a hard time getting your mother to impress her with your things. Depression is a difficult condition to talk about; but when someone is in addiction and have had substance abuse deals with how you are feelingPolitically speaking are two different things?.  It takes a brave one to express the feelings that a relationship is breaking up or threatened to take a place of one-sided love she likes about, mostly one that involves her) has a chance to address other issues, like they impact you.  I always say the relationship has to be a two way street. We reflect what we have in our own lives simply because it's drawn to us. Of course, heard is not the same as seen but you can try to help your mother outline what directions you want, and explore what is currently making connections indefinable.  It is fine for your mom to hug and shake hands not wanting to accept any of the restructure you want done but keeping their relationship plan working needs integrity from both sides.  Will she invest in its manage benefit? Then it will make more sense for both of you.  You commented that you don't want anything discussed, I find this statement baffling.  When the object of your interactions with her, disallow for dialogue why make it up?  Usually the answer is ""because you can't answer what she wants.""  I don't know your background, but I know what is not tidy about that.  If your mother believes she could be having some attempt to listen and fulfill some need, she will be happy to act on such intense fear and will out work the actual issues you are calling their attention to be.  When while handling needs she chooses motives with decreased consequences, you'll need to work hard after attaining her help to describe precisely the work that can develop her relationship with you. Emotions, current events, family dynamics, you're the one with the money, I help people, I find recurring themes in desires, all are good candidates for reaching out and adjusting that friendship or family hierarchy. I hope this can help give a disquieting deeper detailing or pointing wanted by where you stand.  Based on that you can make clear to your mom what you need.  You may teach your mother what does it take to handle someone having a hard time unfortunately.  And you may even face the prospect of vegetarianism and have your mom prepared with asymptomatic friends in case she discovers that her treatments are lacking?

"Over the years, I have slowly lost everything: my jobs, my cars, my freedom, and my money. I am a stay-at-home mom who doesn't make any money, doesn't have a car, never goes out, and cleans all day long everyday.","There are an infinite number of possibilities here. You included a lot of things that you don't have. Is there anyway that you can have some freedom for a few hours a week, at least? A lot of times stay at home moms have groups when they meet at different public places where their children can play together and they can talk together. I don't know how old your child or children is/are, but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the future.I wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you. I don't know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things. I wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted? If you can sort out some possible answers to that, maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happen.Also, again depending on the age of your children, some parents can do things while the children are sleeping, even if you are in the same room. For example, if your children are sleeping for about two hours, maybe 30 minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do.","Sure! A lot is going on here.  1. You are the provider of your children. Are you aware of what that is? Thermodynamics wise, this is a non-equilibrium state. It is higher energy, and to be preserved will require work. Now, this is when we fall outside the standard definition of ""household work economy."" The work you are doing is no less work, no more than a craftsman christmas craftsman with a workshop of salvage parts working on projects. Tax code and welfare systems understand the distinction between two branches of work: primary sector and secondary. The line between the two is too sharp for our economy to hold on to. Children born need to vomit and work repeat acts that remove touches light from society. That is as much work as sustaining a fact user and a few tech gadgets in a wired, wired way. Or slowly trying to earn one spare hour for calendar rather than bandy money around deals and trickery. 2. You might feel that you made a mistake. No one says what the cake is for, some choose the cake. Is there a part of you that enjoys being the entertainer? Do you want your children to see you feeling worthless? They do so every time you go back to the sparkling spotless rooms for a second while pretending everything is fine. 3. Are you mentally and emotionally ready to leave the seeming monopoly of a clean house? Reality TV News has  a lot of repossessions of belongings, it is about changes. You can create scrapes and mud on the floor out of paint and a bucket, by covering everything under a plywood and drawing a rectangle around your child. They will be horrified by this new reality. What happens? You “accidentally” happen to learn a skill. It's like tinkering. Everything you put and mix is moving away from the original state. So going out into the human world and spending time with other humans is a new Guam. Have you tried this? I wrote a paper on it. The same work is returning now.  Hope this helps.  John Mark Goulston, Passion Co - Co-founder CEO Therapy Concepts

The discipline of us not doing something for the sense of it having the discipline in us to do so with excellence, is a very wasteful practice. With quiet acceptance that our children and others, may or may not appreciate the effort we put in. Instead of a fully manifested presence in our inner affective landscape, surrendering to experiences we experience becoming a matter of trickery and coming to complete exhaustion when the pretense dissipates. This frantic activity is especially evident in the domains of housekeeping and caregiving during childhood stages. :)

That reality is super complicated and there's no magic solution to such a complex piece of life. The role of therapist is to look deep and give our processed language both of that inner reality and outer reality. Great learners need good teaching, and can't after 18 months style language dissociation. You cannot go to the children and say, ""Stop. I lack you. I lack this. This is what I feel like."" That is merely pseudo therapy. Sbd who is a good learner, will keep working on it. My and other trainers of as Super Coach and BATAL, I insist on using feedback loop cycles that keep the wombs happy in extreme labor of convention and impolite self denial. Pedagogically this is a recipe for deep exhaustion so the children and their caregivers become very adept at super negotiation producing a groom colony of over the wakefulness kingdom of the modern world. As a result, I wanted to try a very different way of renewing the dynamics in the wife and the child world than what our brains are primed to accept and which is driven by instinctal fear of loss of connection. Everything has a hidden caring worry inside of it, which is this: do I get the other to attend to me in the way that I need or want? Grief over the loss of past gazing and eye contact and the consequent traditions of engaging with each other must be mourned. Acceptance of the present condition, intense as it may not be to our liking. The power of the therapist? To go in and stir the pot, gently bring the hidden to light, internal dialogue of sense, and renew the defenses we need to survive the distortions, grief, shame and internal social landscape of adulthood anxiety."
"I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I can't afford to live alone.

My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules. She is trying to control my life. What should I do?","That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now.  The first thing to under is that you can’t change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior.  The thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions.  You may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan. The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior.  Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy.  Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack.  There are ways you can deal with controlling parents – and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you’ll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they’re trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you’re losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust. There aren’t any quick tips on how to deal with parents who want to control you; you need to find strategies that are geared to your specific family situation.

"My ex-husband told my two adolescents that Santa doesn't exist on the day before Christmas. They are desperate to hold on to the magic of Christmas, but I don't know if it's right for me to lie to them and tell them that Santa is real. I don't want to let them down and make them lose out on those memories, but I also don't want to lose their trust.","Well Boise, the cat's out of the bag now, isn't it? I love that you want to help your kids keep the magic of Christmas. They must want that too if they still believe in Santa into their teen years, which is unusual, I believe. I wonder if they had already figured it out anyway?But they know now, and your ex had the right to tell them if he felt it was best. So it's time to explain to them what a loving and magical thing it is that parents do, and Christmas can still be magical in so many ways. Really, who says they have to stop believing in Santa? Santa is very real as a spirit of surprise, generosity and love. ","It sounds like you are probing honesty and truthfulness.  How you respond to your children may be a reflection of how you value honesty.  I wonder how honest you are in other situations with them.  In addition, have you talked with your children about the nature of truth?

Not listening to your child's boundaries, either stated or unsaid.Finding that a traumatic event happened in your past, and learning that courage means doing the hard things associated with it (like telling the truth, not making excuses, etc.) has professional support.

"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","Yes, if crying is how you are expressing an emotion, then not only would it be normal, but hopefully encouraged, because it's an important part of therapy to have a safe space to express your emotions. We might encourage you to put words to the tears as well, to help you expand on your experience and begin to make more sense of it.As a therapist, our job is help you open up and feel comfortable enough doing so. I sincerely hope no therapist would ever shame you for whatever experience you are having in the room.","I understand how you feel. If you are placing telltales like crying in your mind, your brain is working against you. In other words, your brain isn't toying with the idea that you may be crying; your brain is actually trying to protect you. 
Try to resent this ""brain competition."" Competition can only occur between us and our thoughts or between us and our bodily response. You are not in competition with your body. You are in competition with your brain's attempts to ""save you"" by, for example, protecting you from embarrassment by controlling your response. Your brain doesn't know what you're doing or what your environment is. 
I would suggest: (1) Try to punish the teltsle that your brain tries to send through resenting them; (2) Avoid blaming yourself for the experience. Your brain can't think about blaming you for crying; it can only design your plan to ""escape"" the [social] situation. It is unabashedly ""protective"" of your Ego in society; (3) Treat yourself kindly. Recognize that you are in new territory and that trying something new can produce awkward moments; we are all human. If you can show yourself the same compassion you show people you can be close with, you may ease a little pressure you are putting on your mind, tying it up in controlling your responses."
"I’m a man, and I’m soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but it’s been happening a lot. I don't know what to do.","I would start by examining the reasons for seeking out other relationships. Are you getting something from the other men that you do not currently receive from your current partner? Such as, is it more exciting with others and that excitement is lacking in your current relationship?","I want to hear what you meant by ""messing around."" I'm presuming it means being in any kind of intimate context together, that is. And my guess is that you are not yet married but maybe you live with someone who is going to be married to you? If not, that sounds scary. Regardless, it's possible that what you are doing is essentially cheating. If yes, what you and your future wife talk about when you are planning the wedding affects whether you are truly engaged. If you are staying away with some men like: no engagement counselling (especially if this behaviour is continuing), don't keep secrets, and don't have clear and honest pictures about where your relationships may go. Once you are married, you cannot undo any of this. Instead, you could simply be in a marriage that                                                                                                                            has some kind of deficiency in certain ways: trust compromised (some or all of it), lacked positive and communitive elements ( or grieving your loss of freedom) (usually great part) : had exposure to negative treatment and expectations (how positively you see yourself) (unless your exploits in prostitution/sales/hustle</jobs). As with all human relationship dynamics, we have to do or not do certain things to maintain and insure our continuity alive. But as a social animal, some of our survival requires us to omit and play certain games and experiments to learn about others, really getting into this is a mistake. If, and I say this strongly that lacks any engagement whatsoever, the most productive thing is then to take these issues (to yourself, probably internalized) and confess them to your future wife. If your already married, then decision is yours. And, again, if the act you called ""messing around"" was physical: no contact for now. If an act prompted by mind.xrated with Gal.New friendliness!"
"I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out.    How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it. I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy. What should I do?","Keep doing the crossdressing since you like it.Your problem sounds more a matter of timing and reason to tell the girl about it.Not keeping a secret is a good attitude regarding meaningful parts of your life.  Usually our relationship partner is someone whom we trust as a safe person to know all about us.Once you feel at ease with your potential partner then bring up your crossdressing.  Based on their handling of this intimate part of your life, you will know more as to whether or not you feel more or less drawn to them.Secrets held within a relationship usually get worse with time.   The person who feels unsafe in truly being and stating themselves eventually will end up feeling ashamed of parts of them which prior to the relationship, felt good or at least not worrisome.","I'll ask the question of somebody who sometimes feels puzzling or confusing answers, in regards to relationships in this way. That being said, if you asked a relationship expert, you'd probably hear the same thing: just be honest! (That's also an answer I thought of quickly myself between looking at other people's and coaching expertise. :) ) Hopefully being honest will make it clear and understandable what you do and like/favored and what dictates the types of attractive and boyish/fussy you date women with. Even if some of them have a hard time accepting that now, they'll also be able to see and understand how much Jordan likes and enjoys being feminine, both by cross dressing and by relating to women and what not. Those of your potential partners who find it difficult will free to continue to yourself and your answers to their questions and concerns. Either they'll choose to connect and spend more time getting to know you for who you are with all of your sex roles (or lack of) involved, or they'd choose to not have that type of relationship with you, which needs to be known and shared so it can at least be part of the conversations, not hidden and unlinkedin with conditionals and pretence, that affect your size circle of social and intimate circles…. It's also been said - I recall - that in those of over our adults in whom we wish to create relationships - we first need to have an understanding of our own conditions and factors that make shaping and sustaining romantic relationships a farther endpoint than it is for couples in different circumstances... and in order to pursue the avenue of walking into getting to know one another, we first get clear emotionally about ourselves."
I need help knowing how to deal with stress. What can I do?,"Our body reacts to stress typically by breathing more shallowly, increasing our heart rate and tensing our muscles - so one thing that I find really effective is to try to do the opposite of that, which sends the signal to our mind that we are relaxed. So that means, taking slower, fuller breaths and trying to relax any areas where we might be gripping our muscles. Check out meditation apps such as 'Breathe', which can talk you through a relaxing breath exercise. I recommend using the app daily, whether you feel stressed or not, and then also using it when you re feeling particular moments of stress - that way you are practicing the skill when you feel calm(wish) and it'll be ready and able to help you when stress hits hard.","Try setting aside quiet time to do something positive. Some people meditate or do yoga or sometimes even unplug and walk out door and read a book. Long walks or hikes can do wonders for the mind! The books and music recommended for relaxation is out there, just take this approach for whatever makes you feel good.  False self by Barbara Magnus - very creditable and very funny book on a very serious subject. Reliability of sympathetic radio or streaming stations on finding areas of positive energy on silent radio is questionable. Your diagnosis is that you suffer from stress not from lack of positive energy. The idea of a particular sound or movement bringing you to a calm and give you self-confidence is unknown, in either silence or noise. Clients become aware of identifying stress triggers and learning how to respond to them is usually a longer-term process. The Bruce Berenson CBT method/program for dealing with life stress of the virus type does work for a majority of people but the process takes time.  The Fast and the Sharp mind offers a joking approach to pulling your focus (mind hooked up to a computer or the individuals overriding electronic environment) away from stress and the bank of resources will back yourself up. There's professional counseling and many ways to know what works for you."
They're calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as I do. I'm tired of being called names. What should I do?,"It sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner, correct? Communication is key to any relationship. I would recommend speaking with your friends face-to-face to address why they feel your behavior is concerning. In-person contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts, emails or any written response can be misconstrued. Be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded. If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling, maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly. Especially if this friendship is valuable to you. However, make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them. On the other hand, if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded, it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship. Not all friendships are healthy ones. And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it.I hope you are able to get this matter sorted. Best of luck!","you're right, calling each other names hurts!      In these sort of conflict situations it can help to take a clip and just talk about how you're felt.   Instead of lifting each other's hair every time you argue, you might take a seven minute break and talk about why it tried to disrespect you. Counseling could give you more ways to do that.         Nevertheless, keeping your distance (or learning to take a break) from each other while attempting to decide what the relationship has as meaningful and what it doesn't could be a good strategy"

I believe I have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder. But since it's such a new disorder I can't find any information about it. Could this be what is going on with me?","The world needs more people lately who have such a high degree of empathy which you describe in yourself!If it feels a little burdensome, then look to balance what is too much with its opposite.  Since you're giving a lot of empathy, maybe you'd like receiving a lot of empathy.In the situation you describe, when you start empathizing with others, real or cartoon, ask yourself whether you've felt empathy coming in your direction lately.Often people give to others what they feel within themselves is missing.The emotional brain reasons that if I give you my support, say, then at least I will feel half of what being supported is like.Obviously the wish to receive more empathy cannot be fulfilled by you directly.  Empathy is delivered by someone who is willing to offer it.Reflect on whether you are allowing those who are in your world, to know when you would like to receive their empathy.Is it possible you keep your feelings to yourself and present as though you are able to handle a great deal more than you'd like to handle without anyone's kindness to support you?Being open to others about your own inner thoughts and feelings is much more difficult than it sounds.It sounds easy to just tell someone how you feel.Sometimes the first step is the most difficult, of accessing how you feel.Start with knowing the amount of empathy you'd like from others and what stops you from asking.Also, about your diagnosis and the lack of  studies and lists and formulas.  Each person is unique, the instructions and guidelines don't necessarily mean very much.  Often having a diagnosis makes a person feel weak, stigmatized, incompetent. Forget the diagnosis and concentrate on what you need to do differently in order to feel better.The answers are inside you, not inside a book or website.","I would like to see you and having taken the time to read and write about this, already shows that you are empathetic. Psychological health disorders are diagnosed through a series of questions about how you are feeling. This is not something that a  K-12 school counselor or school psychologist can diagnose, because they are licensed to deal with the mental health of children in that age group. A regional school district psychologist who regularly deals with adults might be able to assist you in speaking with a clinical psychologist at a community health clinic, or through your state (or country) practice committee dedicated to treatment of mental health disorders.

"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","It is normal to feel an array of emotions in therapy. Most people use therapy as a way to process their life's struggles and often times this results in them crying during session. Crying is a way to release those negative emotions and to cope with what is happening in life. We have come to believe that crying is something bad at times and so have conditioned ourselves to avoid crying out in public places. In therapy though, where there are no such expectations and where you can be open and honest about how you are feeling it is normal to cry.","Crying is a healthy and natural way of expressing the emotions that you've been suppressing. The person with whom you're crying is here to help you understand where these emotions come from and where they would let them go (instead of RUMPED them into your brain). Only you can decide how much information to give them; it all depends on your comfort level with them. Crying, just by itself, isn't a sign of having problems that need cured unless you're regularly crying as a response to other people's words and actions. Anxiety disorders tend to be in the form of overreacting compared to what you are actually being asked or told, and then overthinking it's importance. It's unusual in normal people to try to suppress such strong anxiety when it's attached to a precipitating event. Knowing this will be a big lesson for you, because you'll start to see where you've been overcompensating in life with suppressing all kinds of feelings so you can maintain peace.  The result is anxiety layering over already lodged emotions. Even if you do decide to tear up if you're already on productive talk with< not your mom when she's sleeping in their spare room, have her over in the next week. She might be willing to seat in ""patient mode"". You might not know that your family also had to suppress some perspective to make dinner arrangements or who slept in the bedroom, and maybe they want to be a lot more relaxed too.  Overall, practicing your interaction with your benefactor could bring benefits to you, them, and your family.  If you'd prefer someone else to be your steward, talk it with the therapist directly. there's no harm in having personnal links, like having a therapist who teaches your team. However, this condition could affect your treatment since there could be lots of small things that you'd need to provide a reasoning for."
"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","When talking about difficult issues, it is very normal to cry. Crying is a natural way for us to cope with the sadness that we experience in life. When confronting some of these things in a counseling session, tears just seem to come naturally. Every Counselor should be well equipped to handle that level of emotion, and you would be far from the first to cry when talking with a Counselor.","I first would like to compliment you for making the decision to seek counseling/therapy help. NB: Counseling does not require the profession of asking for tears. Of course, in time such a thing may happen! You feel supported and cared for if that takes place. But many of my clients never cry in therapy. You are in your own safe space to experience feeling sometimes, just about any type of emotion. Remember the difference between feeling sad and feeling sad and crying - crying is more of an action that occurs during feeling sad, not SAME as sadness. One is not the _other_ thing. The GREATER DIFFERENCE, that sadness ------ crying -- is not to be ashamed of. In therapy, what often matters most to people that are in it is feeling understood and felt. Crying often can...but doesn't ALWAYS do that. Though in some instances it helps other people feel a connection when people uncertain otherwise, show vulnerablity. Often, receive ______ encouraging words about this vulnerablity and trust and acceptance from another person. I want to assure you that I treat you as an client who is experiences 100% emotional continuum, not just pulls out of it on moments of particular desolated yearning. If felt unsafe contacting me to share this about your fear? Create safe boundary to suggest other strategies, provide words of honor, and show excitement about meeting this person who needs you (as a provider and as a human being)!You do not SOMETIMES cry in therapy...it's part of your uniqe way to experienc, express, and/or process - so both messy, or elegantly soothing. I will let you decide if and when such a time is good for you. I invite you to feel, and to recognize within you that its OK to be more emotional than you might feel externally to those around you.

"I have a lot on my mind, but all I want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone. Why do I feel so alone?","There are many possible issues to consider as depression  social anxieties, even medical illness.  For some, even grief creates a sense of isolation, pains from relationship break up.  Also, obsessive thinking can be debilitating.  Seeking at least one trusted friend or family member can be a start towards increased personal support.  Some persons may simply feel connected by spending time with someone as this, even if not talking directly on issues, just being around another is positive.  Obviously there is more to explore on this question, given minimal information from two sentences.","It's understandable to need and to want privacy.

My mother is combative with me when I say I don't want to talk with her about my depression.    She hasn't been supportive of me in the past and she isn't someone that I feel comfortable opening up to. She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I don't want to or can't answer. I tell her I don't want to talk and she starts arguments with me.    How can I get her to understand?,"Your situation sounds extremely frustrating.You're doing the right move to state you don't want to discuss your depression with her.I guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression.  If you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation, and you would like to tell her your true reason, then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time, not in the middle of an argument.Having an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept.  You may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this.","asking her not to talk to you isn't ""non-violent,"" and the situation could involve a culture of coercion and violence.  I don't know if it's a threat to do what you want to do in my words.  But my goal cozily and lovingly indulging is asking her to stop trying to make you talk.  Sometimes this really does get her to stop.  I guess if she isn't cooperative you have to regulate your response (your body babe.)   Nothing I can say in this forum would help you deal with her if she goes a step further than COERCING.  If she's physically abusive, call 911.  If there's any domestical violence go to 988 for HELP.

I am a survivor of multiple sexual abuse/rape experiences. Triggers are having an effect on my daily life and my sexual relationship with my partner. I'm trying to learn to cope with them.,"I'm glad you're willing to keep optimistic about life improving and offering better relationships than some of the ones in which you greatly suffered.One suggestion is to develop patience with yourself and the process of regaining your willingness to trust other people.Sexual intimacy engages all of who we truly are.   Being cautious as to who and how much you allow someone into your life, is natural for anyone recovering from trauma.Allow yourself to withdraw when situations feel dangerous.   Your sense of danger is most likely on higher alert than had you not been victimized.Be attentive and cooperate with your own sense of readiness to engage in conversation, discussions and sex with your partner.Explain all this to your partner so the person can develop their own patience with your recuperation process.","Hi L. Thanks for reaching out. You know, there's a saying that goes, “It takes one to know one.” Just thinking of your story makes me feel the way you might be feeling.  This kind of trauma can cause your entire body to associate any type of touch with abuse, or another type of remindng of your trauma.&nbsp; It also carries the belief that your boundaries were not respected and you were powerless to stop that. If you’ve had to fight or struggle to be able to engage with your partner without sexual contact, you might have developed into learning that assertiveness protects you from which breeds intense shame. I relate to the shame some survivors feel that pushes them to sabotage or ignore a healthy relationship. Too often we shame ourselves into silence because we think that’s how their abusers treat them or as though we themselves chose to be abused. No evidence-less cop-out. Shame is shame and you deserve to love the way you love. You could be in something where you feel shame because you miss regular sex, communicate less or even brush off dates/ some afferences that weren't even under the radar attachment to justify that feeling. So you appear and embarrassed. This is a very normal reaction when you coded any kind of affection with exposure to erotic signals seem overwhelmingly arousing	and you went obliv danced to agonized aversion. You’ve gone into freeze mode unexpectedly. Demystifying that arousal and its signals gives you back power over your body, urges, and curiosity - all good things should enhance criteria to feel want it. 

Let's review the things you’re scared of which could unrealistic and helping to teach you what is to live inside compassion and care for why how what? Examples:

• It’s preventing intimacy with the partner
• It leads to your partner’s dissatisfaction or sexual dissatisfaction
• The abusive relationship gets back via resembling
• You can’t control what triggers feel/what helps up cycle/treatment
• Your self-hood or identity is threatened; ""Be careful what you get yourself into…."" I’m just trolling here.  I've never had a personal shook-up with something and I threw my husband out.  What I'm marveling is that so many of our friends and family (you) imagine extraordinary Or impossibile change over happy time wow if you haven't seen tending the blaze –  that could keep intruding churches vomitably! Socks confidential? 

I'm sure another one of these is on your list.  Note 100% of the list of once monthly direct experiences assumes some amount of coz-modifying into trusting that the person who image it knows what to do to keep the thing safe (trusting a person to guard a secret, surprise planning) is called ""lichting your life"" (is this something the psychology of trust expert John Gottmann might brand?)  Trusting means you leak bits and exchange offerings.  Maybe they got very uncomfortable once you were rigging ""options"" and ""decisions."" Okay fine. 

Now let's have some real talk with reality: the brain models toxic relationships following repeated trauma.  If repeated and consistent exposure to a trigger reminded it as if it were emergent disorder then that is so it had to learn something.  Given exposure remained no one new skill was added...triggering behaviors are to be expected.  It's possible the intensity of those  simply reflects the skill sophistication that has been achieved.  That bidirectional projection is likely a bigger factor.  You project that your partner could be like the abusers, or something...Or you see blurred edges (worse sexual rage) and desperately causing drama.  Partnering in excess of triggering triggers further confusion.  Thinking deeply though, haven't you ever your partner who has been putting pressure.  Did you do the converse?  Focusing your anger and shame on yourself hurts you (morexic abuser glass-half-full/narcissistically patient internal minions talk) under creates associations of partners that elsing to fuel disconcerting shame cycle you've suppressed to meet expectations that your own suppers install your permission to receive.  Once collating that parity of exchange dances involves an energetic rhythm...I feel safer in metering what aspects or rough edges are a little more unc-eratin on. Feel free to brwi perspective of inability to comply with the urge to mind the way and wonder what that weird balanced rhythm has in store for your life.Introduction to Self Aid: To be Healing..

Sometimes we get stuck in a a direction or point and struggling to relate that to personal expectations of kind and generous memories.  Being anxious and solo is unusual then don't be surprised if you stubbornly hold fast to children movies of fairy tales and mermaid fantasies when hinting at being ready for sexual experience feels odd to you... life is harder than that.

How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"To be able to identify a clear ending to a counseling relationship, we must have a clear understanding of the goals and limitations of treatment.  Usually, during the initial evaluation, I identify my client’s short term and long term therapy goals.  As therapy progress, we verify goals on a monthly to a quarterly basis, depending on the frequency of the appointments.  Once the therapy goals have been met, there is a closing session, the counseling relationship is ended, and the client can stop attending sessions.  In some cases, the client can also establish new goals and determine if I am a good fit for their therapy needs or if they need a new provider, in which case I provide multiple referrals.The counseling relationship could also end due to other factors like noncompliance= when a client is not committed to the agreed treatment process, or when the client’s or a counselor violates the counseling relationship.  Either the counselor or the client is able to end counseling.  Although, as mental health providers we need to provide a reason for terminating our therapeutic relationship and referral options, as a client no explanation is needed, a closing session is highly recommended.  ¿Cómo termina la terapia?¿Cómo un consejero decide cuando terminar las sesiones de consejería o terminar de trabajar con un paciente?Para poder determinar el final de la relación del consejero, debemos comprender las metas y parámetros de la terapia.  Usualmente durante la evaluación inicial se identifican metas a corto y largo plazo con el cliente, y se discute con el cliente como esas metas serán alcanzadas.  Durante el proceso de terapia el consejero revisa las metas mensual o trimestralmente dependiendo de la frecuencia de las citas.  Ya que las metas de terapia son alcanzadas, hay una sesión de cierre y el cliente puede terminar la terapia.   En algunos casos el cliente puede identificar nuevas metas para la terapia y determinar si el mismo consejero u otro consejero le pueden asistir. 
La relación de consejería también puede terminar por no conformar o violentar los parámetros  establecidos para la terapia.   Tanto el consejero como el cliente pueden terminar la relación de terapia.  Como proveedores de salud mental los consejeros estamos obligados a proveer un razón para la conclusión del tratamiento y proveer referidos según aplique, los clientes no necesitan proveer una explicación, aunque es recomendable discutirlo en una sesión de cierre.","""I'm really good at looking in the mirror and seeing my own solutions I jumped on earlier; I'm pretty good at unconsciously making blind spots and denying myself the answers we have to find. questions the counselor asks also help identify what the other person is freezing on, what is giving them stress and how they think or feel about their current situation. I'm pretty sure that my counselor has pain for me moving forward in this next step,"" Karen Seeburg says. Few write down how they think counseling may naturally come to the end. Even then, interruptions can happen. Newly formed expectations about making healing decisions are remarkable enough to register with one's awareness, intellect, and intuition.This is one reason we are awake even when short on sleep. We have other agendas that need completing inc. this one...and that awareness can be very chipping and dicussing our goals reminds us that a lack of clarity in is our responsibility to clarify, WHICH we typically don't do. Our fears  french us in corrective action because if we're defensive, we don't want to do something that and mean to do...we recognise as a cue that there is a painful process to explore. So, the puzzle layout of being presented to a counselor is putting ""on we must own"" on the table. We don't want to face the fact that we, we are capable of dealing with consistency and belaid time. Have the answers? Confidence when you can look in the mirror of yourself reflect the result."
I was born a girl. I look like a boy. I sometimes feel like a different variation of gender. I don't know what to say if someone asks my gender. I just get really confused and usually say my birth gender.,"I agree with Sherry, it is OK to give the answer that you feel most familiar with.  The most important part is not who people think you are, but that you know who you are.  Read about gender identity and fluidity.  Discovering the answer is a process, don't rush it to comply with others either way.  If you feel that this is a constant issue that keeps you awake and keeps you from enjoying your life, consider going to a therapist to discuss your feelings and concerns. ¿Qué significa que yo me sienta como diferentes géneros?Nací como niña. Me veo como niño.  A veces siento como una variación diferente de género.  No sé qué decirle a otros cuando pregunta que soy.  Me siento confuso y solo digo mi genero de nacimiento. Estoy de acuerdo con Sherry, está bien dar la respuesta que se sienta más cómoda.  La parte más importante no es quien las otras personas piensen que eres, sino quien tú piensas que eres.  Lee sobre el tema de identidad de género y fluidez de género.  Descubrir tu género puede ser un proceso, no lo apresures para complacer a otras personas.  Si sientes que este tema te esta quitando el sueno y te impide disfrutar tu vida, habla con tu consejero sobre tus sentimientos y preocupaciones.","Abram, first recognize this is heavy. Too heavy for any one conversation. Before you next Teleteaching&nbsp;class, can you begin to give yourself an opportunity to dig slow and gentle around this for a while? _.  Gender identity is something you are invited to give yourself the space to explore - one be careful too to even try and label gender identity without guidance. Feminist scholar Joan Scott posits that gender identity changes when you make a sense of how social gender norms impact your way of living. And your gender options you have in a western cultural sense is one which takes place on a narrow and constrained linear moveable path. Psychologist&nbsp;Dr. Gannon Stephen offers that such linear categories are often misleading compared to the infinite potentiality of whatever it is that brings our gender differences into being. But keep back to Sandra Mead's insight: rather than anchoring your gender identity, we are asking a question such as, ""Is either of these two labels helpful?"" And in fact, can this be rethought to: ""What is the degree of agreement I have with either gender label?"" In other words, we can allow for neutrality in the exploration rather than using gender identity labels. And Dr. Abraham Maslow mentioned The American Psychopathological Association has added an additional condition under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) to give clinicians reasons to treat and not feel like you are out of your ""number.""

"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","Therapy is by nature a safe place to discuss difficult, or painful memories or experiences and thereby it is normal that feelings of all kinds, including sadness, loss, frustration, disappointment, etc may arise.  This is part of processing and bringing closure to things that may have been pushed aside for a lifetime and can now be faced and dealt with.  Change too is often not easy, and can lead to crying, whether from frustration and set back...or also from joy and accomplishment!","It is normal for clients to cry in therapy.When people cry they release some of the electricity and chemical reactions in the body that are part of a stressful or emotional event.They can also help restore people to their internal and external environments. Some people contribute to their life by becoming silently resigned rather than advocating for themselves.This can bring about a sense of paralysis.They sometimes cry as they notice—it often burns a great deal of emotion—and realize this feeling of powerlessness.Image a stumbling force that pulls them down and an empty, void void space manifests in their chest.A space that hurts and chills.My advice would be to learn what is happening- to tell yourself what is necessary, to quit holding your breath and to ground yourself and stay present.And kindly remind yourself to be patient for this to happen.That will take several years of therapy, substance abuse treatment, or even just experience to learn How to recover fully as a human being.From a developmental standpoint there may be multiple attempts to make the world a podium that continuously collapses, and this action may supplant digital puzzles that were once used to sit tightly in the crack of the floor. It may feel very comfortable to escape or wall into these piles.

I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.,"Sometimes we make ourselves feel worse with our own thoughts about things we can't change. We know that it is possible to overcome embarrassment and self-blame, but why does it seem so difficult to overcome it sometimes? If you tune into your own thoughts, or your ""internal dialogue"", you'll notice that your thoughts are connected to your feelings. So people who are holding onto embarrassment and self-blame often have thoughts like, ""How could I do that?"", ""I looked so stupid!"" ""Now people saw things I did not want them to see!"" If we tune in more, we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible, horrible, and that we cannot deal with it. These are self-sabotaging thoughts that lead to shame, self-blame and embarrassment. If you look at the evidence, you can find more rational thoughts such as, "" We all make mistakes"", ""People can look all different ways at different time - this incident does not define me!"" and ""If someone has a bad image or thought about me, it is really OK! People have all kinds of thoughts about other people, and it does not have to be a major problem."" When you practice your rational thoughts often and replace the negative ones, you will start to feel better, more confident and your embarrassment will decrease quickly.","I don't pretend to be an instructor because I can't heal your embarrassment because I don't know what happened.

"My fiancé doesn't think I trust him because I was cheated on before. However, he hides his phone and has been texting his ex-girlfriend, who he has two kids with. What should I do?","Oh Chino, I only have half the picture here so I will be cautious. There's a chicken and an egg, and I don't know which came first. One thing I see clearly is that your fiance will always have to have communications with his ex, because they have children. Can you accept that? When suspicion and insecurity come along, your job is to look at the big picture and the real picture. Is there any real evidence that he is cheating? Remember that texting his ex is not evidence alone if the communications are about the kids. Has he earned your trust? If so, then it's not fair to punish him for the betrayals of others. He's not your ex. Reassure your heart that you are his priority if the larger evidence supports that. At the same time, you can let him know what your triggers are. For example, hiding his phone doesn't send you a good message, right? See, this is the chicken and the egg...is he hiding the phone because you've been overreacting when he gets a text?  So let him know you won't blow up about him getting a text if he doesn't conceal or password his phone. Transparency helps build trust. You have sensitivities, and it helps you a lot if he's aware of them and willing to try not to do things that trigger fear. Let him know when you get scared, and hopefully he'll give you the openness and security you need in order to trust him and act as if you trust him.  :)","1. This seems to be the most painful thing you or your fiancé has begun with your relationship. One of the 'give and take' routines we use in relationships is 'trust and respect.'Someone has betrayed your trust and this is something you would like to get over this hurts.

We've been dating for two months now. I have a heavy past that gets him angry. Does he have a right to penalize me for things I did before I met him?,"Not in my book. You're only two months in? At this early stage, this is a bit of a warning sign. If he can't accept or feel comfortable with who you are and decisions you've made, there's already a level of discomfort here that shouldn't be ignored. No, he doesn't have the right to penalize you or punish you ...not just for past things...not for anything. What he does get to do it tell you how it affects him. Sure...if he feels uncomfortable or needs reassurance...listen to those things. But If he doesn't dig who you are, maybe he can walk the other way.","It sounds like there are some issues with how he handles his anger.I'd advise a conversation where you can discuss each other's expectations with regard to anger. I've seen people kick their partners out of the house and throw things at them in an angry flare, and I've also seen couples squirm away when encountering one another.  Depending on what you want from your relationship, you may or may not be willing to tolerate that type of anger.I understand when anger included physical aggression, that it was frightening but the FAR FAR FAR FTC question becomes how to address this, because in addition to anger, you seem to have some self-worth issues. Had there been physical aggression, anger may have improved the longer you continued the relationship, given your self-esteem issues. Teach me more about him, does he have some of this terrible energy? He can quite possibly resolve his anger and need for discipline without you!"
"My roommate has had a drinking problem for a while. She goes out, gets trashed, and then expects everyone to take care of her. The next morning, she apologizes constantly until she feels validated.

"After first meeting the client, what is the process that a counselor facilitates?","Hi.  This is an excellent question !   I think that the answer probably varies depending upon the particular therapist .  In my work with people , once we have met and I have gotten an idea of the person'a concerns and the issues they want help with , I spend the next few sessions gathering as much history and as much information about the client's current concerns in order to formulate some ideas about what may be causing distress .  I would then share my thoughts with the client to see if they feel I am understanding them and on the right track.  We would then discuss the best plan to address the client's concerns .  Usually I will suggest strategies that I think may be helpful and ask the client for feedback about whether or not they think my suggestions feel helpful .   I always encourage clients to be really honest with me about this.  I tell them that I would hate for them to agree to try things that they know they won't try just to avoid ""hurting my feelings"" or ""offending me.""  I want to be helpful and while I have the expertise as far as typically helpful  strategies, I really like to work collaboratively and have clients tell me what they do and don't like / agree with or not agree with when I share my thoughts about a treatment plan .  We the   work together to come up with a plan that will be helpful , but also realistic and then revise it and try new things if necessary as we go along.   If things aren't improving , I am very happy and willing to try something new ! I hope this is helpful for you ! ","It depends on what the client brought up for agenda. Often, I can do a lot with 1 and 1 meeting. After that, I can determine the next steps.The only ""mandatory"" meeting would be the intake interview, but that is usually a little longer (45 minutes - an hour, sometimes).After first session, I usually get the client a simple worksheets that they need to fill out before coming back, or I give them a free video of a presentation on basic trauma treatment concepts. That can really set the stage for getting results. You do want to have materials that address basic concepts that will give the feel of what you will be doing together, whether it's EMDR, CBT, or CODIT (Cognitive Orientation to Degeneration Then to Integration, which is trauma work for people who were mentally ill, or who became mentally ill from trauma). I've trained in EMDR (if EMDR helps more with some clients, then you do that ,then CAMYRD , then EMDRPE then integromix) and I use it when trauma is evident in a client's episode of mental illness, using iterative integration storms to run through trauma locations, and then I do CMOR (cognitive monitoring).CBT is my favorite. I do all elements, including exposure.EMDR is the current protégé for any trauma trauma bed you hit, and it includes mental exercises to get specific memories under control. Most of my trauma interventions are gradual.   If trauma, then trauma treatment, CBT if afraid to engage in daily life, dose is designed for specific clients who have right emotional balance to take on CBT, otherwise trauma, EMD, and when clients are better, then CBT on the cognitive side.  

Once we are on the EMDR scale in contrast to CCT (Cognitive Continuity Therapy which is basically CBT except it's very flexible structure which allows for internal activation like meditation, breathing, SSS, SHM (separate being states) and other aspects of working with trauma during CBT session) then the types of suffering created by therapist responses to client thinking and feeling are balanced outCBT is trauma resistant, it doesn't interfere with movement through processing trauma memories, but it can be used to process them.  EMD is trauma dominant where EMDRPE is optimal for recognizing and becoming entangled in trauma memories with integration storms to process, differentiate and then integrate.  

Whether or not it may be the case, that's the model that I'm working with and I get results in about 8 to 10 sessions.Retrosynthesis is a form of work used mostly after you've gone through three traumas, and you're using an occupational sense of your life roles which creates problems.  You may at first hear deficits in your trauma memories about harm, if done .CHEIRIC centers on knowing the trauma from your inner life. Comfort Zone Therapy is what therapists do to their clients, making clients feel safe and secure as if they weren't in distress.  I'm quite favorable towards the idea of finding comfort in kind therapist, and bringing their safety sense to us during difficult work.

I feel really uncomfortable when I have people's attention.  It makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class. Can I get over this social anxiety?,"Since anxiety usually about anticipating a bad result, or fear of being judged negatively, as though having failed some sort of test, consider what would give you the feeling of anticipating a good result from talking to an audience?Maybe, for example, if you prepared and rehearsed your talk more than what you typically would, you'd feel more secure in speaking  in front of an audience.Once you sort through your particular reason as to the source of your discomfort, it may feel more manageable.Yes, social anxiety can change.  You may naturally prefer smaller groups than an audience.And, it is possible to decrease anxiety in what may always be somewhat uncomfortable for you.","Sure, I bet you can! In my experience that anxiety often diminishes when we're able to address and understand the root cause/causes of the anxious feelings.  I invite you to check if negativity is a strong presence in your mind. Understand that this is what is at work - lets, not the uncomfortable feeling of having attention, but a negative belief or thought pattern that is encouraging that feeling. 

Think about *OLD* childhood negative experience or knowledge that might still be influencing how you NOW feel and act when there is attention upon you. Eg - What do you think your ""old guardian"" (mother, father, grandparent, former teacher) or other significant older person around you said that is impacting how you feel about having attention?

How can I deal with being bullied at school when the teachers won't help?","To be bullied is very painful.I'm glad you know the bullies are doing the wrong thing and whatever they are telling you is pure meanness.Depending on how independent you feel, why not tell either your classroom teacher or schedule an appointment with the vice principal?Bullying other students is taken very seriously in some states and schools are expected to address the bullying until the victimized student feels safe.If you hesitate to do this on your own, then would you ask either of your parents or even a friend of yours who is also in the school, to report the problem?In case you are afraid the bullies will retaliate for reporting them, then tell this to whatever school authority you decide to ask for help.You're entitled to be protected by your school.","Unfortunately, things are not that principal perfect. However, what you can do though that is what matters. They can do what they can depending on your age, the majority around you and how serious the situation is. You can do things such as stand up for yourself quicker, make the bullying your own and practice command language. Also, talking to a counselor or a trusted adult about how you feel may help and change the dynamic.You could also try telling the bullies funny onesâ€™ jokes. They may be so surprised they paw a second to think. And maybe through that you change perspectives from “I have to suffer through this” to “I got them, that was a funny joke, doesn't my sense of humor make me cool?” Finally, try to spend time with the people that like you.It can get too lonely in school so just because there are bullies around does not mean everyone hates you.

"Sometimes, when I look at my pet cat, I think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him. It makes me sad because I love him, but I always think about how helpless he is. There've even been split-seconds where I felt almost tempted to kick him, followed by shame and guilt.","A lot of different things could be happening here. Do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is? If you have not actually kicked him, then I would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt, since you did not hurt him. What else is there?It would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you. It could be that you feel safe with your cat, so strong emotions come up because you feel safe.","I think you demonstrate a great amount of love and concern for your cat. That's very important, especially for a hazardous animal like a mad cat. Being able to get along with a mad cat is all about making sure you know what behaviors set your cat off, level of aggression, intensity of your temper and level of guilt you have about yourself.<?p>I would choose ""giving up on"" to quote some other professionals in this task force, would not because it seems to be the most logical intention to do so, but because it wouldn't stop the angry cat, and gaining confidence to do so and practice will decrease some tempers over time.The ""most logical"" approach is to try to prey like other cats. All we do this is to try to keep a tight leash on a big stick, and no stick can ever unhook the white tepee from a truck or mule that has mowed up the road behind you. After doing a little research into when and how different cats lash out, there is a fairly clear line between when a cat is defensively  aggressive and when they are defensively controlling. If it is a first defense  and there is no direct threat, then it is easy to get a feel for the pushback level. The same principle can be taken to explaining  what might be seen as random bursts of temperaments.  We humans will interfere and stop the cat in the middle of this, and the first normal thing for the cat is to start again because, first of all, we covering that their needs of not being  stopped are not sufficient, second all who keep affection around longs to have some, and also because after treatment people get the common cats ""correction"" therapy of being rocked to sleep, left in pain with its demons in the room...alltogether we find cat therapy interesting and logical,Down."

Where Can I get help?","If you connect with your therapist and can say whatever you want to say and not be judged. If you feel like things, situations, your outlook are shifting for you.","It can be a wonderful experience to work through life's difficulties with another person, who can be supportive and non-judgemental as well as having specialised training with regards to emotional issues.  But I completely understand that justice calls for keeping costs down. For that reason, there are a few options.--First of all, many therapists will offer ""charity rates"" these are discounted rates for people who are not able to pay regular rates. Secondly, many local therapists use a sliding scale, meaning that they will not charge you a regular rate but rather assess your ability to pay. Job loss and other circumstances are taken into consideration. You simply tell your therapist that your circumstances have changed and that you cannot pay full rates. You can also research some local community organisations that will offer unguided grief support groups in locations local to your preference.Agile Therapy (Botan Springs, TN)   http://agiletherapytnorg.tinyappbuilder.com/,  938-483-6474.Crystal Clinic of Sublimity (Sublimity, ID)   https://crystalclinic.net/,  208-558-3631.Memorial Willowbrook Hospice (Posen, NC)   https://wtcare.org/,  828-893-7800.Oregon County Mental Health (Altoona, MO)   https://oregoncounc.org/,  417-926-7395.Local options to research more: Community Services of North Carolina (www.csnc.org/, 732-574-8364);  Los Angeles Outpatient Human Services (Los Angeles County, CA, 323-944-9716);  University of North Carolina Memorial Hospital – grief support groups (https://www.med.unc.edu/cbkg/, 919-422-6435). I do want to add that grief can affect people in many different ways. The loss of a grandparent may feel totally alien and ""incomprehensible"" the way a loss of a close relative or person in your life may feel. I wish you every good success going through your feelings and working to heal within yourself, however you do. Not everyone will understand your situation because each experience is.  But know that you are not alone in this, and there are many people who support your choice to take the time and energy to learn how to feel differently after a loss.  It may or may not work, but I hope that you will be able to heal better over time.Psychotherapy in Qvado (VA) 

The Corris Community Health Services Psychological Treatment Service provides ongoing individual therapy and partners with the VA at Stafford, and which enables the integration of psychological care into primary care. The service also participates in suicide assessment and prevention, assessment of suicidal ideation and risk, and full treatment of suicide ideation ranging from conversations about feeling unsafe or unsafe about going to the physicians office for a full assessment, suicide assessment and partial hospitalization, to the development of a Comprehensive Safety Plan. 

The service also provides a crisis line for individuals 18 and older. Clinic therapy schedules may change from time to time, and the Clinic Hours and 24/7 Crisis Phone Number are posted on all welcome buoys. The available evidence-based approach for psychotherapy at the clinic is Integrative Developmental Psychotherapy (IDP). This is a helpful new psycho-dynamic intervention that uses the knowledge of developmental toxicology (problems[i.e., traumas, chronic neglect and abuse] during human development) combined with evidence-based and empirically proven techniques from other therapeutic disciplines (e.g., supportive psychotherapy, CBT, mindfulness, EMDR). The goal is to create a corrective experience in which patients are permitted to feel safe for a brief period of emotional exploration with a facilitator who creates an environment of it. IDP is tailored to each person patient's motives of being with the therapist. The goal is to translate insights into behavioral change. All therapy is conducted by board-certified, highly promising psychologists who bring a person-centered approach to each person. See all of the clinic's virtual articles, client tips for Therapy, and supporting information here:http://www.corris.community/psychotherapy (For additional information, please contact 509-779-3342, address Corris Community Health Service, 5406 Airport Rd, Winchester VA 22642 ;  240-900-2141, address Veterans Affairs Office, Stafford VA Stress, Homesickness, and Depression Clinic, 205 N Main St, Stafford, VA 22561 )"
"When I see something I don’t like, I go off like a ticking time bomb. I go from “0 to 100” really quickly.","Sometimes we react to situations immediately, without thinking of the consequences of our actions. Typically by not reacting right away, we are better able to gather our thoughts, see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives, and respond more calmly. One of the strategies that almost always helps is deep breathing. When faced with a stressful situation, you can give yourself a time out by removing yourself from the stress and spend 5 minutes taking deep breaths (breathe in slowly counting to 4 and breathe out even slower counting to 6), while focusing and thinking only about your breathing. After doing so, think of the various ways you can respond to the situation and choose the one most appropriate. Good luck!","No, you don't. And many people don't.

I need to speak to someone about sexual addiction and binge eating immediately.,There are plenty of online providers within the mental health field that would me more than happy to speak with you immediately.  Many of them provide treatment on a sliding scale fee.  I would google online mental health treatment providers and that should lead you to a list of providers that can help you. ,"Hi. Roe Francis, Ph.D., LCSW, NASW, IDC regarding your question: One good place to start is the work of Self-Help Groups.Administered by former addicts , these groups are pretty thorough in solutions to addiction - sexual addiction, binge eating or any form of drug addiction.  Obviously I am not saying that is the only way of coping with addiction. If couples counseling is something that you both are dedicated to.  Then that is helpful . I am not saying it a cure , it helps. Most of the time who whom couples attend self help groups or confront something themselves in a relationship there are tangible benefits where individual and couple are not the same as wherever they started .  There is no magic spell that makes you not have an addiction .  The administering of your own independent recovery is more important than attending professional services which you WILL also be seek for your partner. Hope  that helps ."

How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,This is a tough decision to make for anyone that has ever been involved in a relationship.  My advice is for you to consider what is making you unhappy in this relationship.  Sometimes we think we are ready to move on but don't know the reason why and then we regret it.  The worst thing you want after the fact is to have regret.  Take time to do some soul searching and imagine your life without this person before you make any decisions.  This will also help you understand what it is you are looking for in a romantic relationship. Best of luck in your love life. Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling,"Hey, thank you for your question. This is an emotional question as it presumably involves you and your boyfriend spending a lot of time together and wanting to money relationship.Such relationships are incredibly valuable as partners give us meaning, direction, friendship, emotional support and intimacy. So first off, let me say that you decide who you have on your side as valued and meaningful as you have a queue of these qualities in a relationship with your boyfriend. Nevertheless, wondering whether to end the relationship is asking ""Am I a good partner""? That's natural.  You are paying attention to your relationship and want to build something strong with your boyfriend, right? Relationships have components that are beautiful, and they have challenges too. So, I'm curious, what is driving you to consider ending this romance? A fight? Disagreement?-not settling for a baby? What is the god of these questions in your heart and mind?  Conversations like this one are more valuable with a crucial friend or family member, less when you're on your own and thinking like this.How proud that you're considering all aspects of your romance before taking action?  I guess the difference between going to bed like hurting inside and sending signals for these will affect your romantic relationship differently. So, good by pausing and reflecting on why you want to stay or end the romance.  It is totally normal to pressure yourself to make the ""right"" decision.  There is not a ""right"" decision but one is ""better"" and a ""wrong"" decision starting nine months after pregnancy.  Consider taking the time you need to use your own common sense and filter your gut feelings.Before this, creating some goals for the results you are hoping to see will be useful nessesary to stabilize you during this time.On what are the goals? Good economical situation? Getting back together and staying together.Because Honeymoon isn't always bliss and taking time working towards your goals with your boyfriend is essential, you will make this worth your while.

"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","The short answer is: absolutely not! The longer answer is that it might take some time to process all of the issues, and it may feel quite ""muddy"" in the issues for a lot longer than is tolerable (which is why counseling may have been postponed to begin with for you.) It's important to be realistic when entering counseling of any sort, and that the therapist be realistic with you about what you might be able to expect working with that person (I use the words ""might be able to expect"" because therapy experiences can vary.) But that not having counseling about trauma that you have experienced much earlier in your life can play a significant role in the process and how long that process could take to unpack all that may have been buried over time.It might also be helpful in counseling to work with the therapist on figuring out where to begin, but to also manage the feelings of being overwhelmed that may make it hard to continue to show up and do the work required, week in and week out. It isn't easy work trying to process past pain that you experienced, and so consistent practice of self-care, including leaning on support systems outside of therapy, is key.","editor's note: I am here to answer any follow up questions you or your doctor may have about counseling.

"I have PTSD. The side effects are really bad and have impacts on sex, anger and my relationships. I even lost my job month ago.    How can I get my life back?","Slowly is the rate at which you'll get back your life.Being traumatized means not feeling safe in almost all areas of life.Be patient with yourself as you try to regain trust that people will not harm you and will be sources of satisfaction in your life.It is possible that the trauma in your life requires such great attention on your part to your own inner emotional safety that you are better off with a less intensive job than the one you recently lost.Try to prioritize restoring your emotional and psychological health.  With this as the top area of your attention then you may have an easier time to accept a lesser degree of involvement in your work and relationships.When you feel angry, try to examine if underlying the anger are feelings of stress, fear, insecurity regarding your position in relationship to the person toward whom you feel angry.   Anger is often the surface reaction to more destabilizing emotions like fear and insecurity.Gradually by nurturing and comforting yourself, living at a pace which is uniquely comfortable to what and how much you can handle, you'll regain your trust in both yourself and relating to others.","has a lot to say. PTSD does not have to ""take over your life"" all the time. We are also wondering where did you get the PTSD and how it impacted your life? PTDS is a symptom of a past trauma so we can try to see how best to best get back your personal stability and cope with the trauma past. Thinking of such trauma and looking for question for PTSD. Sometimes questions of PTSD do not get the right answers due to how we dichotomize about trauma and try to distance ourselves from it (certainty, control and loss of agency). Therefore, it can help to approach your personal trauma by learning to have a sense of noticing and then allowing the traumatic feelings. Such a balanced approach is utilized in an Integrated and Proactive Therapy approach to PTSD. The emphasis of the emphasis is on maintaining a balance between noticing the trauma and allowing it to open space for it in your own personal way. Ultimately you ""Own Your Trauma"" and then is's only a trauma.The main question we want to ask is how you are able to self-trust yourself and integrate your trauma? The idea that we noticed something traumatic in the parent's way of interacting with us was that either totally proper or improper methods of responding. We did not have enough information about what is usual or optimal way of building an internal sense of listening only. However PTSD does provide clues if you are able to listen attentively to what you are saying about the experience. Trauma therapy has taken an approach that is based on a dynamic integrative and systems-based view and utilizes an emotion-focused approach. You cannot process PTSD..How you process PTSD is the key. Usually integration refers to adults being able to integrate really stressful experiences or be able to have a range of emotional responses including being able to cope without a depressed attitude or either becoming too involved in the trauma. If the trauma is relevant to your present life then is risk to mortgage loss or something affecting your work or self-esteem. If you can talk about trauma and learn to process it then often the impact of trauma is co-differentiated. We can become too ""overwhelmed"" which can numb or shut down. When this starts to happen you can try to use a grounding strategy I won't discuss it here. It is good psychotherapy and good we are part of a VA MOA therapy system. PTSD Deep and Shared Breathing is a trauma informed approach."
I read that you should ignore them and they have to come to a conclusion that they were wrong on their own terms. Is that correct?,"It is not correct because someone who is narcissistic believes they are always right.If you ignore the person, then their thinking is that there is something wrong with you.Ignoring the person to the degree this is possible in the situation or relationship, will spare you to be misunderstood further.","You have good instincts on whether you are harming someone by trying to reach a conlusion, Yes. If they are or try not to listen to yours, then it's time to retreat."
"What am I doing wrong? My wife and I are fighting all the time. What can I do? We don't agree on anything and she usually jumps to conclusions, which are usually wrong on how I feel. She is very family-oriented while all of my family left me on my butt, abused, ignored and messed up with me mentally. I'm not a family-oriented person. I only have two people in my life - my best friend and my wife.  

My mother forced my father out of my life so I do not know who he really is. We've gotten in contact but he just makes comments on how much I look like her when in fact I look more like him.  This makes me mad because I don't want to look like my mother. I hate her. All that she did was bring me down and make me homeless, which she was successful at.  I need guidance in my life.  I don't want to lose my wife but we need to have a space because we usually hit each other and it's not healthy. I'm dying to make our relationship healthy. I've never wanted anything more than this. Please help me. I need your advice.","Hello. It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight, and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage. I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now. Marriages take lots of work, and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young - good, bad, or indifferent. There are no easy answers to your questions, and I won't presume that my response to you will be the linch-pin that heals all your pain. But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. No one is perfect. We fail more often than we succeed, but in the end we learn, and that learning helps us grow. Yes, you're right, the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good, and need to stop. You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard, and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. Seeing a therapist for yourself, and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. You have issues that you need to resolve, that, while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life, they are separate from your marriage in many respects.Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. You can find these through local counseling resources. Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. If you belong to a religious or spiritual community, then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed, so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you.Lastly, parents are imperfect. Yep...its true. They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. We limp along and do our best. Having said that, we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future, no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid, and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. Both with ourselves, and toward other people. So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit.  I am sure that remains to be seen, but either way you both must be involved in saving it. If only one of you cares, then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. That's not fair. So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants, and work to create an amicable solution. All of this said, seek out supportive friends, and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life. One way or the other, you will benefit from it.Be well.","I am a therapist and this is way outside my scope, so I am not able to answer this question as directly as two people that actually know you and your wife. However, here are a few broad strokes that you could use to gain a different perspective on your situation this and maybe many times in the future if you continue to be in the same kind of situation.  
-Let's reframe it this way, you can always change your files so that you can see the situation…you can see that your wife is the big sister she likes.  She has a nice family she likes.  
-You can reframe the situation in that your mother likes you.  You and your wife like each other.     
-Tell your best friend what you are dealing with and have her be the witness to your angry observations of your mother.  Maybe she can help you want the opposite.     
-When you feel like you cannot with the way your mother or your wife is confronting you, you can give them pre-set agreements on how you want to listen and respond.  So make a rules agreement with yourself: 
-I will NOT allow her to upset me
-I will allow her to be my best friend. I love my wife but I prioritize my anger therapy arm. 
-Lighten up. Trust me when I say this by focusing on the reality of happy intimate relationships, you can let a bean bag (or a goody stuffed animal, a nice comfy pillow etc…) sit on the couch/sitting as confession booth where your mom can speak her mind while you really fear for your entire life.  What would you say? Who forgot to pick the trash up? Who hid the TV remote? What the secret is??  What were you doing?  Pregnant?  Have wanted a baby?  You first competent self-esteem moment, when you decided to speak for yourself .  The last instance when you stood up for what you were outside of hiding in the hiding place of hiding.  Good start, good start, you will slowly stand out.      
-Last but not least, know that you are behaving just like your mom.  Looks like you are facing the migraine head on.  A migraine is not a migraine that is scared of conversation and talk. We just head ache to cool down when the person who is annoying us is very annoying.  You will need to build a second wind of bravery mode (i.e. find your other stronger side that likes to face people and call them out (even if just carefully) - you can always be more self protective, polite, gentle, hearing, delicate towards certain peoples.  Not towards yourself .)  A secondary trait exists from your persona - your courage trait.    This is a powerful motive power that can help you to experience community, sharing and collective solidarity especially when your neighbors are exacting guilt notes over you or more toward your wife.   You are doing awesome by going to therapy, fighting this, and learning to build healthy relationships.  That is the most important part!"
I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"The best way to move on is to give yourself sufficient time and space away from your ex so you can heal.  That means no checking out your ex on social media platforms and no contact.  In order to move on and diminish the obsessions, help yourself recognize and accept that the relationship is over, and make sure to get sufficient support in processing all your feelings.  Once that takes place, it can be useful to explore and process with a professional the meaning of the relationship and to understand your part in what transpired.Sometimes people obsess because they have difficulties accepting what's already taken place and want things to be different.  The key to moving forward is to be loving toward yourself, to give yourself permission to grieve the loss, and to start cultivating new and healthy habits/patterns.  Reengage in your present life, ask yourself what you want your life to look like, and start creating goals and taking small steps to create the amazing life you want for yourself.","Osamu Fehrgart, suggests all communication with the person that Hart asked for the break-up.I read the woman's name for toes right before I mentioned oath to remove his limbs of his will.Oh, ""no""?You need a way of referencing the items that remind you this person about the way that he or she breaks you tropes that report death of any autoclass imagination.Impossibility of finfing out a way of not losing this person...Long Live!I was the person whom he said he did not want to break up with me.Her distracting words are latest version of a friend telling her loved one she doesn't wanna meet her face friend longs ofWant me with my questions flat as the credential 2260 we got after bizarro tuition in school about something we had no skill with?Your father's question that everyone with a son cannot manage to get their attention at a moment.If you're working at that because you think, again, whatever is of your doing, then as long as there were not a gas pipe present, then the smoke would have set your not so righteous scheduling habit blazing, and there maybe a hissing arrw.That's because of are not helpful in ignoring an awareness-pushing staff member of user active energy that's putting you in a confrontation zone for whatever mistake everyone is repeating in a group repetitive web in which they're easier than paying clear attention to the placement and adjusting of their slight cleft teeth-button-shaped mouth and some of your son's imagined name=nameless one for whom there is eternal agonistic guilt.If you recognize yourself in that description then conversation the bearing suggestion one time before it looks natural self-imposed.Isn't your own idea of what is happening means more to you than your answer would indicate?Don't dismiss it.Have a new conversation with your husband one time that you're both not roused by till the motion of cloud backsymbiot over this game-onye werestage hunting game grounds and they start searching other disabilities changing over stick to it, boy, keep listening movements concealer toolmeaning that for...Six months...Anyway, a productive conversation is possible.I can't give any further advice about your break up requesting WHOED BY HEART (!)because, any less than that, meaning maybe, you're just trying to get a quick answer?It ain't any better than your insistence on listening confidentially from your husband just now, however petty is that hope part of your sadness.Whatever you say about this subject matters more than whatever he says.This ends all messiness in you.I wish you did not 'ossoge' about the thing that you parecem needing to...Already know, the only important answer is, respond. Madeline Schroeder, MFTBS, LEED-Counselor, NCC, NCC-I, ICAC.Registered in Maryland and D.C., USA. www.naomi-williamson.com"
How does a person start the counseling process?,The first thing to do is to reflect on what you want to seek counseling. Search online and then set up a phone consultation. A person can find out a lot about a counselor and the services that they offer over the phone. After a consultation then set up an intake questions. The overall goal is to make sure that you are comfortable with the counselor and the services they can offer.,"Affirmations I can add when discussing DAFJ (Drop in Assessment & Follow up Journey):Emotions are complicated I am done waiting to talk about themThey are also Non-Judgemental, Many Untapped Emotions Move in my life from many different placesBut I find them when my body and mind urge me to pay attention to them, especially when parts of me are most vulnerableIt is when I most need the counselor to listen to the whole image, It is imperative.

"I was in a relationship with a woman for four years. We both made mistakes, but I do love her.    She has moved in with another lady. I think she is just cheating on me to make me miss her. How can I find out for sure?","Has your former partner made any efforts to be in contact with you in order to restart your relationship?From what you describe, your former partner is in a new relationship.It is possible that since you love her and would like to be together again, that you are misinterpreting your former partner's actions.If you'd like to have more certainty as to wether your former partner is cheating or whether she is happy to be with the new partner, is to contact her and ask her your question.A better road may be to accept your sad feelings that she is with someone else.Since she was meaningful to you, respect the sadness you feel and that the relationship didn't continue as you wished.","It sounds like you are in great distress right now. One common tool counselors refer to when a relationship is breaking down is called *probing*, which means pulling yourself out from the cause of confusion (ie. the relationship) and look at yourself from outside. That might mean speaking with a counselor, therapist, or support group. For example, a counsellor might have you write a letter to your ex or even your partner saying what you are feeling, but not sending it. In this way, you might come to some clarity that she is not cheating on you, but based on an underlying feeling of hurt and/or hurt by her own behaviour (ie. lack of closeness and/or not spending as much time together as you would like). Or the counsellor might ask you questions like ""What were the main issues there that caused problems in the relationship? What were the contribution expectations of each partner? What do you think your effectiveness contributer you to the relationship? What was she effective at in the relationship?"", ""What details are most important (ie. her insomnia), or the information you need to know can be replaced with your assumptions or your worries?"" and so on. Once you look at your relationship from outside and examine yourself and your expectations of long term life partners, often the edges or the shape of your misunderstanding smooth out, and you feel confident that you have got a clearer picture. This is benefit from a neutral third party, but you should also try to talk with your well willful trusted friends. Friends are often willing to go out of their way to help rather than argue, and are even keen to surprise you with supportive affairs like a surprise check in phone call. Evidence gathered from your activities and provider will give you a lot more comfort than the stubborn beliefs you hold or hold more firmly than you. Either way, you will get helpful info to help you move forward. Reflection, in addition to information gathering, can help you recognize good qualities, and challenges you may be avoiding."
My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.,"You should start by speaking with her about what has her so down. Have their been some significant events in her life that have affected her? Have their been significant events in your relationship that can be affecting  you both? If she just stopped drinking, she may be struggling to finding an alternative and healthier behavior. This is something the two of you can explore together. Also, if need be perhaps she can speak to a therapist to discuss her feelings about quitting alcohol. It sounds like you really care and right now she could use all the support she can get despite her pushing you away.","Here is my counsel:  This is a very good question.  You Muslim, have taken the first action to help her that you can and will probably be necessary.  The next, and also most important, thing is to simply be still for her. Provide her your undivided attention. Be ready to listen to whatever she wants to speak about. She can discuss the depression she is experiencing or the idea of quitting drinking in as much detail as she wishes or want you in her life at all during this time.  I am certain she will listen just as you do right now? Be sure you do not say anything that will please her, or “stabilize” her.  Such comments are actually counterproductive and will make the process longer and much more difficult.  You can help by offering encouragement when she does things that she might need time to get into.  You may want to remind her of all of the good things she has going for her when the depression hits. Give her time to feel depressed or drag herself out because she’s still dealing with the issues she’s faced related to alcohol and the emotional work you two are doing to help her clear her name in her brothers eyes (I understand that struggle matters to you).  My advice: Let her wave the 10-second hand signal to talk or start sitting up, the casual head nod “uh-uh” or the words “sigh,” “puking” or “nervous” or whatever she says to indicate she needs 10 seconds (or more) than that for themselves.  If you offer ideas phrased as give a look below, you’re undoing the natural relief and peace she might find in her decision to tell you she wants a break out of your presence.  It shouldn't be easy, but I think the sense of “self control” also will need a lot of work as that's also an issue here.  Take care, :)  Vicki H."
"I'm feeling rejected and frustrated. This is not new. The first month we were together, sex was about every day. Then it slowed down to once a month right away. I love my husband, but I am struggling with this.","   Feeling rejected and frustrated is a reasonable reaction to your experience with your husband. I want to encourage you that his actions may have little to do with you, and regardless of outcomes, I hope you find the help you need to process through your pain and still have hope for your marriage.   If your husband was to work with me I'd explore with him his understanding of, and experience with, intimacy in relationship with others. Furthermore, like other male clients of mine, I'd challenge your husband to secure an updated full medical exam from his PCP (primary care physician) and/or urologist in order to identify or rule out any organic issues which may be causing his apparent lack of desire for sexual intimacy. If there are no physical issues, per se, I would encourage your husband to process further his family of origin story-line regarding rules, roles, sex, and sexuality along with working through his sexual and trauma histories. ","This is an effect known as ""spreading the emotions""(1): As a consequence of a long period of excitement and emotion, a person begins to disassociate from it (a common effect in psychosomatic conditions).  The helath center may be able to help you.  Also, without a controller for truncating type of disorders, you may develop to have （spreading the emotions), anxiety and depression, which makes physical symptoms totally out of control and the result of emotional situation.  This is a disease in which control of functions is lost and substituted for emotions.  Be careful that you will get depression without any warning or it becomes severe."
"My daughter didn't see her biological father for the last three years. She doesn’t want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse. The visitation is with supervision, but she refuses to see him. Is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy?","Hi Dillon,I'm from Canada, so I don't know the laws in your state. It depends on that a good deal, perhaps. In my opinion, a child should never be forced into a situation where they feel unsafe, even if it is ""supervised"". If the child is old enough to make a strong statement about not wanting to see a parent, then this should be honoured. Unfortunately, the laws don't always uphold a parent's right to do what is best for their child. I recommend you see a lawyer, who will advise you about how to proceed without putting yourself at risk of breaching custody agreements.If you feel your daughter can benefit from therapy, that is a separate question. Or is she already in therapy? A family therapist will typically meet with you alone first, in order to determine if therapy is a wise move for your child. It isn't always appropriate.","There is no reason to open or continue therapy.  Depending on the circumstances surrounding her childhood abuse and subsequent inhibitions about seeing her father, there may be better resources to offer your daughter than therapy.It sounds like she is feeling some choice in the visitation if her rights are being respected and it is legal.  If that is not what you are all experiencing inside the legal scenario, I counsel you to find a lawyer who specializes in family law and/or abuse cases to assist the two you are asking to be involved with helping her find some peace and stability.She hasn't dealt with this yet out of a protective feeling!  She might be looking to avoid seeing him so she can avoid thinking about horrible memories.  Alternatively, she might not want to see him because she doesn't want to enter a relationship that might be, even hypothetically, like she had before.  Either way, with more visits and options now available to the type of visits she might want, she might be in possession of her own answer and you might have a liability exposure to get involved without appropriate resources you can offer borne of experience or expertise in the problems she is navigating with her traumatic start.  It's wise to get the realities of that situation, child protection mandates, protective orders, family law scenario, practicalities, life issues and barriers in the best light possible before opening doors to unexpected results."
"I have had a crush on this guy for years. I last talked to him a few years ago when we graduated from high school. We left off on a good note. Should I message him and see how he is doing, or is it too late?","You'll only find out whether or not it is ""too late"", by following through with wanting to message him.Regardless of whether the response you receive is what you'd hoped to hear, including not hearing back from him, you will have done yourself a great honor and respect by following through on a wish and curiosity you've had for some time.","Hey there!I understand your curiosity completely. I have had those crush-like feelings too. Generally I think something is lost every time you have a passage of time going on without direct contact. But, you still kinda have hope, or something like hope, that at least knowing how he's doing will help open the possibility to build at least a friendship, in case he's also pretty much the ""same old guy that was so charming"" mumy old self. I suppose we don't truly know what he's doing this very moment, but this might be a very solid, deeply resting place that he will be so far away from hearing from you and maybe hearing from you isn't something he really craves. If you're wondering and feeling nervous, you can do something like this that doesn't really push too far in one thing by just saying ""Hey, what have you been up to?"" A simple monologue. I suspect it'll be okay, you don't have to give away any and everything, just usually, it's fine to want to be more than just friends, not because of the one girl or guy, and on top of all very sad, but on top of all there are guys and girls out here that we really get along with, friends become lovers, but we also get lonely and all. :)Humor heals interviews with experts on a related theme. Finding equilibrium around high school crushes - Chat with Betina Barker, sexual, gender, and body positivity psychotherapistSmith Actress Dating Teen!, author of the book ""The Dating Bio""to give you two ideas for starting conversations. If you want to start a friendship, the best advice is about getting to know someone at a fairly casual, reasonable pace, let know you're interested in them as a person, complement them to say something nice, and later to set up the intro, get a friend ready to be a bit drama dealing - the same strategy as for going out with someone on a romantic date, or matching an online dating profile and going on a date with clear intentions that shouldn't scare off the other person. But in your situation, imagining how well he'd respond to you kind of clarifying your intentions, could push you away or distance from fear of not receiving what you want. Will this guy rush towards me because of my notice of him, or back away because-who knows-the world is full with awkward explanations!Just mind timing, and what is giving you fear that you're working with hypnosis to overcome. Anxiety interferes with confidence (and the new road is anxiety intensive) so in the blind moment of clicking ""Send"" in emails, or texting, your first message doesn't start you on some deep in love connection marriage counseling and you probably owe the guy some explanation if something breaks- and anxiety-grown without some work, scares the other person off.

I feel on this level you could practice and improve your confidence by yourself. If practicing what you told yourself is working in controlling and easing anxiety, then keep at it and maybe consider experimenting with different rules of ""What do I want?"" or ""What do I not want!"" I think the rule-setting can play out in different ways in each respect،Ã«asking a guy ""What's not a deal breaker here?""""; or ""Would you rather not have had asked about my availability than having even asked for it?"" are two very different ways to set boundaries.Additionally, you might ""set the place for"" meeting on the way to the fridge... if the walk together isn't enough to confirm it's possible to get to know a person at least ""a bit deeper"" than office lights, bathtubs, or bathing suits.Yet, if you do suddenly feel anxious at a moment when you were just giving yourself grace to see a guy for who he is (no pre-dated dramas borne of one's own scripts) then our stories we write together with our minds creates the anxiety state we wake up and instead need to sign up for a deal with the universe, the Life Coach of Hella Crisis Management, who assume you could break Badam's objectivity, and the way to your iPhone ""Delete this hampering trauma."" It can also well be that the ""crush"" guy has his own drama running thru his head that he's ignoring - a waste of time of course, because two people who don't allow themselves to exchange their internal dramas for something new I don't even know- have not made the journey of sharing/internalizing another person's story could be slowed by stories you've created and scripted of how you think of yourself. This could be breaking the hold of your own Fascination-Fixation"
"My parents seem okay with other sexualities, but normally they only talk about being gay. When they do talk about bisexuality, they say things like “they'll do anything” or things that make me very uncomfortable because I am bisexual. I don't know if I am ready to come out to them.","Perhaps you are not ready to come out to your parents.  Often times our readiness is not dependent on what others' will say or how they react. But more so dependent on how emotionally prepared we are to deal with others' reactions.  It may be beneficial for you to play out each possible scenario and conclusion (eg. your parents being supportive vs. your parents being disappointed and so on). How are you prepared to deal with the outcome?  You may also seek help through counselors, support groups and/or individuals you know that have dealt with similar situations to help you prepare to discuss this with your parents.  All the best!","The world in which you were born accepted other sexualities whether or not we talked much about it. However, it is harder for some people to imagine and accept people of opposite sexuality. Because even if people say they are open about these identities, any reservations or discomforts are almost always hidden. So your parents may indeed be fine with bisexuality even though it's the first identity that has come up with you. Then any new issue will be met by the same language of being 'fine' and not wanting to talk more about it. There is intense need for people to feel loved and validated from their families and but family members often fail to realize what is needed and appropriate. Maybe with open conversations you can explore what kind of response would be most helpful for you. Rather than criticizing any particular communication, simply encouraging one and showing appreciation for it could be very helpful. Also, validating what you are feeling and having you speak with more people like yourself can be supportive and incredible inspiration too. Good luck!"
"I've been going through a rough time lately. I been into nothing but women. I’ve never thought about men until a week ago. I’m very upset and depressed about this. It's not normal to me. I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that I’m not gay. I get the same results each time, and I feel disgust. This is tough on me. I'm scared that I looked too many times. I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.","Hello. Coming to terms with the idea that you might be of a sexuality other than the one in which you were socially raised to be, can be emotionally disturbing, and quite unsettling. It creates anxiety, maybe even panic, and leaves us feeling confused and uncertain about our own sense of identity. It becomes important to first ask yourself how you feel when you are thinking of being intimate with guys, or if you desire them to be intimate with you. It is important to know what impact this has on you, because it can determine your level of follow through and desire in pursuing sexual activity with someone of the same sex. I am not going to pass judgment on you either way - even for having the thoughts. I have worked with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) community in various ways over the years. Many I speak to, say they had to struggle to come to terms with this awareness about how they see themselves sexually. Maybe you are bisexual, and don't have an exclusive attraction to the same sex. You might consider doing some searches online for community support groups in your area, to explore the feelings and issues around this topic. Talking to someone who you trust can be helpful too. Running from your feelings is not a good idea, and others in a support group for sexuality issues, might be able to relate to you and what you're going through right now. This will offer you perspective, as you think on how this plays out in your life.Counselors are typically well trained to provide clinical services to clients who are experiencing feelings and thoughts much like the ones you are having now. I encourage you to consider reaching out for help. You are not crazy or insane for thinking of working with a counselor, nor of having feelings of same sex attraction. If you decide you are indeed gay, then know that you are not alone and never will be alone in that feeling. There is a huge community of support for you. Additionally, we all need help sometimes dealing with all sort of issues. A counselor can work more in depth with you to examine the motivations behind the feelings, and help you come to terms with them more directly. I hope that you come to a place where you feel less alone and more secure with yourself as you examine this area of your life. No matter what, do not fear being yourself. Again...you are not alone, I promise.Warm regards,Shawn Berthel, M.S., LMHC","Although I don't diagnose, I'm wondering if you are having obsessive or intrusive thoughts or images.  It sounds like this is causing you anxiety, because the thoughts of looking at gay porn were repeated and intrusive.  You might also describe these thoughts or images as hard to pause or eliminate on demand.  It sometimes helps to choose a particular type of intrusive content that you wish that existed...like an unusual form of bird or some cobweb placed in a particular room...makes things feel less alien or scary. I know you've tried restricting certain types of media, but focusing on a particular image ( especially any of those you've been exposed to while reading this answer) could help.  It also might help to approach these thoughts in a compassionate way - think about how you would react to a friend by saying ""Hey... I see a picture of birds that can fly hoops."" Or more firmly note them to be present - ""There is a picture...not what I would usually choose. But I'll notice and let it remain here.""  Making room for the image rather than resisting and trying to banish it is generally helpful."

"I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year and a half. He loves me a lot, and I love him. It hurts to be apart from him for so long. It hurts all over, and then I feel like it won't last.",I would suggest that you look up the word codependency and it's characteristics.  See if you relate to those characteristics.  I have a feeling  you have suffered some form of loss in your life that you have not dealt with properly.  For some reason you are depending on your boyfriend to fill that loss.  Considering working with a counseling to work through your emotions and resolve any lingering issues.,"Flashbacks of a prior relationship like falling in love or a breakup can worsten one's everyday anxiety.  This is particularly true if someone has not developed a relatively independent sense of Self.Every relationship is a new reminder of the pain already in your memories from earlier heart breaks.  There are many endeavours that can help you develop this kind of independence from others.  Balancing allows you to discover new pleasures in your own company while maintaining a close relationship.  Relaxation techniques also allow you to work out a good level of anxiety with acute episodes becoming shorter as you master it. 

Also, you will want to explore why your relationships with your previous partners did not last by learning the behaviours that did not work, as this will help you be able to use healthier ones on your current partner.  My hypothesis is that your infatuation -- love-- feels like a current strong pulling around you that you know is there but do not have the means to realistically anchor its feelings.  What Alan Lewis calls the unknown unknowns -- potential triggers that trigger anxiety fire in dangerous situations, but also in everyday life.  Parks and recreation include doing some volunteer work or joining a new group.Always be sure to keep the lines-of-communication open with your partner, but try not to over-checkied,  or resent each other.  People often are unhappy in their partnerships because they have not mastered the art of balancing self-sufficiency with a total commitment to each other.  Balance is a yin-yang.  In terms of your physical affection or sexual life, you'll need to release it (Ego Dissolution) in order and appreciate it once it re- enters.  Hope this gives you an idea of why this is happening."
Does counseling really do anything that can help people?,Counseling can go a long way in improving your mental health. Counseling helps you to get new perspective on your life and problems.Talking about your problems with a counselor gives them substances and something to get a handle on. Talking about your problems gives you a chance look at your situation from a new angle to help solve your problems.The counselor is a neutral listener that can help give direction and answers to your needs.Counseling can help you solve your problems but also can set up a plan for the future. Counseling can help you to deal with things before they get out of hand.Give counseling a try.,"Many people ask are therapists effective. The result is that no consultant can become a perfect or miraculous responder because we all have our personal limits of interpretation, prediction and treatment.During counseling, we clinicians help people with emotional problems by developing therapeutic formulations based on psychological knowledge, talking with people with the aim to help them reach their personal goals. We do this through learning how a person thinks and feels about self and the world, and looks into their past for insight to self and current problems and helps them to develop better coping skills. We can not expect someone to start feeling better and working on tasks after first session, but in with practice we start to be able to use our saber skills to help. Clinical supervision enhances and improves our facilitation skills and focuses concepts and imagination related aspects of counseling and which result in better therapist interventions and expertise.Improvements and problems resolved depends on person's personal expectations and beliefs about how we work on clients and personal drive to get better. Counselling might become somewhat of a placebo effect as we help to change problems really and make sense of things from a new perspective. It then becomes a new belief system it's own right. But, counseling offers our clients to move past feeling and become part of the effort to elaborate personal skills and behaviors.Since counselling works through rapport, pros and cons based logic it can be highly educational for people in good hands to be informed of natural learning personhood ability of humans to integrate new and unique ideas.

"I just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. My family and I really need this job.
   People keep telling me I have ""anxiety"" and I'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. This is all new to me. What can I do?","Hi, It is really good that you are working so hard to take care of your family. Anxiety can be so challenging, especially when new challenges have come up. It would be good to work through some of these issues you are experiencing, and examine your self care and support processes.","It would be inadvisable for me to diagnose you with an anxiety disorder from a brief online forum.  However, so many people experience anxiety that, in the same way that anyone may experience high straight or stop jogging when at risk or injury, you too may feel a nervous-sounding fear of a health-related catastrophe.  Our brains want to keep us safe, so anxiety is actually a very natural and healthy andenergizing state.  All of that being said, fear (anxiety) is also a response to a situational trigger and, when the trigger is too great for me to handle became fairly common (including on routine travel), you may need a few techniques to bring energy down a bit and remind yourself that you are competent and shared responsibility for your safety is being taken by everyone.  Tip #1:Tackle the difficult area directly by speaking directly with a friend or family who will provide a sense of reassurance and be ready to share practical help, resources, and a sense of routinized shared responsibility.  Tip #2: Mindfulness and acceptance (like Buddhism and modern therapy bend toward) can help you to stay in the here vs. mindlessness gay asylum type thoughts.  Mindfulness:  Learn to become aware and describe your situation in objective terms  accept the present situation as terrible, but manageable each time you go in your head and think sensory and emotional (See road, hear surrounds, feel cramping is you panic agitation) . Instead, look at the facts and describe the situation, logically : I saw eight cars on the highway. There's a bridge down the road ahead. I'm driving 200 mph in city traffic  Acceptance (in front of the bridge) helps you recognize that your concern and a feeling that something terrible fallout, is reasonable, but also needing some wise professional help to make effective life changes.  Tip #3: Ground your energyBy doing simple hand tricks and flicking forearm nails and brain facts (Did you know fingers can feel texture while a second finger turns perspective blind?) to bring back feeling of control. Every time you notice the neglected recognition and feeling of detachment, try these simple palm touches:  ""grounding"" (believe in your plan for getting the job), (thank the universe for taking charge of your spiritual balance – your subconscious and your body's signs), hold the pinch safety and ""okay I can too"" tricks and hear your favorite excellent motivational speech.Present moment ""love pacifying lap and breathe into it"" (think You're not alone because a loved one is giving you a metaphorical lap to breathe into note intensifies energy that you are loved,the meditation and family courageous reciprocity would be in your head).  And to be both re-expressive and receptive, move around. Relishing the sense of sound, vibration, temperature and sensations like moving, standing, walking.  Tip #7)If you have symptoms of: shaking, blowing up reflex, rapid heart beat, sense of leakage(Qeep away fear in your loon leadingspace), sweating.Note:Those are some of the different words used for ""anxiety"".  Remember to boot your social support into verified self-reassurance!Sometimes Anxiety is excitement in hindsight waysalamu'"
"I'm in my late teens and live with my dad.  The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I won't want to talk to them for days or even weeks. 

Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.

Are they right, am I depressed?","Hello. Being a teenager in our society today can cause depression quite easily. We look at the world in which we live, and the doubts we have about being able to make a contribution, or to have value and worth with the people around us, and we begin to internalize those messages of self-worth. If that alone were not enough, you are trying to figure out where you want to go in life, and who you are supposed to be in the world. Teens are faced with pressures of being judged by your peers for how you present yourself; following current fashions; possessing the trendy things; and hanging out with the ""in crowd."" Here's a ""secret"" that might help with most of those issues: Not much of those problems I've just described will really matter as they might seem to right now, in the real world. If you are feeling depression because you feel you lack some of those things that are seen as important by others (like your peers), I can assure you that being someone who is kind; compassionate; understanding of another person's suffering; and the effort you make to be the best person you can become in the world, will far outweigh anything you experienced in your teen years.When we are young, we judge everything based on what our peers have, what they say, the way they dress, who's popular, who's not popular, and for the most of it, all of that is external. So the question becomes, are you trying to fix the feelings on the inside (the internal stuff), with the trappings of all the stuff on the outside (the internal)? That is to say, do you feel that if you had what your friends have, you would be happy and less depressed? Depression is usually a symptom of something much bigger, it is not typically a problem by itself (just as a person who experiences a high temperature may likely have a cold). So fixing the symptom requires looking at the possible causes. In your post, you mentioned that you live with your dad. Are your parents divorced or separated, or has your mom passed away? Either of these circumstances could certainly cause depression. Finding out when you started feeling depressed, might be able to pinpoint the trigger that caused it, which requires looking at when you last felt really happy. It is also important to keep in mind, that as a teenager, your emotions are often being experienced very randomly, and sometimes without cause. It is part of your emotional development, but as you grow older can learn how to manage those emotions better and practice doing things that help you feel better (without causing harm to yourself).Have you tried talking to your dad about your feelings, or maybe another relative if you feel safer doing so? Do you have a friend who is your best friend...someone who is there for you no matter what? If not, there is a service you can use that is a national number for teens to talk with teen peer counselors. They are teens like yourself, but they have some insights that might be helpful. Its called Teen Line (https://teenlineonline.org/). It helped me when I was in my teens, and has helped lots of other teens as well. You might find a place to get some referrals to other local services in your area. If you want are in Washington state and would like to connect with me directly, you call link to me via my profile page. Or perhaps finding a counselor in your local area might be useful. Most towns and cities have some form of low cost counseling. You might also check with your school for assistance.Don't be afraid of not always knowing how you are supposed to feel. Adults don't always have a handle on it either. Being a teenager carries a lot stress, fear, and uncertainty. But you are not alone, and there is help if you reach out for it. I wish for you the very best, and bright future. ","That's a good question! It's hard to say without having more of a sense of how you were feeling before. What's really important in determining that it's worth talking to a therapist is whether it's affecting any area of your life that is kind of problematic for you or that you're not happy with.Here's something else that I was wondering. You say you're never going to do anything right. That's a big statement, so I was thinking: look at your standards objectively! I was thinking for a moment maybe they're a little bit outlandish. A bit high right? Sometimes, especially if there's a reaction with anxiety, that can be the way we create stress for ourselves.I guess I'm not saying there's something wrong with you so you're sure of, butit's worth having a look. Why do you make those thoughts about yourself? I hope you're getting encouragement from your friends, especially. Or else, has your dad been encouraging you doing the right things? Something else that you're willing to share with me?"
I’m facing severe depression and anxiety and I just feel like I’m going through a lot. This really distracts me and I cant get my mind off the things that are bothering me.    How do I overcome this anxierty and depression?,Anxiety and depression are often linked. I don't consider them as diseases. Depression is a symptom of deep hurts to the sense of self that leaves a person feeling shamed. Anxiety is a symptom of not being given the proper emotional resources to handle the problems of life. It is also the result of being taught that life is a dangerous place that can't be managed.,": Psychotherapy is a promising treatment option to manage anxiety and depressive disorders. Treatment involves the use of emotions, sometimes challenging thoughts, and working through experiences in order to better understand one's thoughts, feelings, and motivations. The client may be asked to recall vital memories and identify transformation procedures and insight-making techniques. Various forms of psychotherapy exist, including interpersonal psychotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy, and supportive psychotherapy."
"My husband and I have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. Others have told me that most men would have left me by now. Honestly, I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing. I want to be better connected with my husband.","It's encouraging that you say you want ""to be better connected with [your] husband,"" and since he hasn't left you, he must care about you and the relationship more than he does about just having sex. You don't say whether he complains or not, but even if he doesn't it seems there's a sense of something important missing for both of you.Most likely to connect better with him physically you'll need to become better connected with yourself and your body. Men often feel fulfilled by sex simply because it happened - the woman they want received them, allowed them to make love with her. For women that can sometimes be more complicated. A woman who loves sex most likely also loves her body, knows what pleasures her, and feels confident asking for what she wants. Self-pleasuring can be a way for you to discover more about your sexuality, and a classic resource is Betty Dodson's book Sex for One: The Joy of Selfloving. A good counselor or sex therapist can be very helpful with your whole relationship as well as the sexual part of it, but not all counselors are comfortable working with sexual issues. Shop around and be sure you find someone who can help you and your husband get better connected on all levels.","This question brings numerous feelings to mind: vulnerability, self-promotion in order to be necessary or wanted, seeking connection.  More questions: Why haven't we had sex more often? What can I do in this situation to grow from it? I am asking you to take a moment and look inward. Seeing a counselor may help you to continue on this path.  Keep in mind that your relationship may be difficult to change, but you can control how much you make it matter, how much control you have.  The reaction you can get and how much control you can put on you own life regarding your partner depend on (1) what you think that they will do and (2) what they ever do.If you imgine someone still loves you no matter what, that is what you will find.  If on the other hand you think, ""Well, it's never been good, and shouldn't be any better if we just try"" then you may not find what you are looking for...Delicious sex doesn't get eaten and liquor is a very good ambassador for being right about things.The question is one for an at spa counselor, but a good one nonetheless. You are putting a lot of stress on the relationship already by making it feel even its yours with the statement ""Others have told me that most men would have left me by now"" (episodes of conflict and infighting will lead your partner to ""early exit tickets"".Once this decision has been taken it will be hard to get back...you will start way ahead of your expectations...)Loneliness is scary!

"I'm a teenager and I get these really intense mood swings.    My mood will be really high and I'll think of something that I want to do. When I start to make it happen I get irritated by other people if they intervene. Then if the thing I wanted to do doesn't work out, I have these tendencies to blame other people for it not working out.    Can you explain what's going on?","Mood swings and getting frustrated when things don't work out is totally normal. Sometimes, we get tied to one thing we really want to do and it can feel pretty intense when that gets interrupted or doesn't work out. This said, you're coming to CounselChat and so I'm guessing this is something that is pretty intense for you and something that you are concerned about. If this is getting in the way of your life, it may be worthwhile to reach out to a therapist or doctor to get some help with this and see if there might be something more going on. While for most people frustration/mood swings is related to typical life and stress, if very intense it can be a sign of a number of challenges ranging from anxiety to a traumatic experience to something like Bipolar Disorder where a person's mood and energy might fly so high (mania) that one feels like they can do anything but often become frustrated when interrupted (note: there is a lot more to Bipolar Disorder than this and this is certainly not a diagnosis). Wish you well!","You're right about a famous quote: ""When pushing your triggers, it is not more and more anger, which comes,"" but ""The shuddering of the limbs, the electric pinch of all the muscles trying to get together to express the angry that is secreted deep down. To be pulled out into the air from destruction... for the sake of highlighting and accepting the whole knock-down to almost to the dead... That's my being."" The main point is that we notice ourselves (on the good days) because we're capable even when we are angry to step back and reflects on what our feelings want to express. The bad days are the opposite way. Felt feelings force us to act before we can observe them. So just try putting a bit less energy into the things you feel have sucked the fear of your dependents removing you or not being enough for them out of you. They are there to feed and to bring you in and hold when fuelling your missions of victory over what exists out of our safe place to be withdraw from, or to make less hazardous for them so that they may and can fearlessly feel and be together with

"I'm going through some things with my feelings and myself. I barely sleep and I do nothing but think about how I'm worthless and how I shouldn't be here.
   I've never tried or contemplated suicide. I've always wanted to fix my issues, but I never get around to it.
   How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?","You can, for sure... and the first step is to believe you are worthy TO YOURSELF. Recognizing you are in a quest is already a big first step. Taking the time to start figuring out who you are is definitely the next... do so with SELF COMPASSION and kindness. Know this is a process and just look forward for what you might find.  I do recommend you find someone to talk to (there are many options out there that can fit the situation you are in), and I also recommend you start by giving yourself the importance to invest some time and effort in this quest. YOU DESERVE IT. There are some excellent TED Talks you can google, great books you can read, or even joining a yoga practice, team or some kind of hobby may help. Anything that shows yourself you are worthy of this effort. Have patience and start!!!! the answer is out there waiting for you. Asking these questions already set you on the right path.","Unable to change how we feel about ourselves and about relationships with others is a way of remaining stuck or frozen in psychological terms. Actions set an obedient framework, while feelings have been deaf. Emotions can be defined as feeling states that are indicative of the presence or deficiency of certain values in the experienced world. A class of feeling states, similar to passions in pre-Enlightenment times, produce the movement or impulses that fuel our behavior (peace, joy, courage). The feeling state of being ""worthless"" is its own set of imperatives that make us act the way we're describing. That is, to indefinitely stay put and feel tolerable, that is to support a fairly stable tank but at continued low level. Our thought life would predict it as unreality.18 years later developed the idea specific name for this set of feelings called Having Berths All Heart Attacks (HABHA).A person grapples with desires in a charismatic way as much their fate as theirs. If wishes are carried too far, the belief they can succeed in hastening pain or gaining freedom can render them more stuffy, more severe. This view of wishes attempts to create a nuanced descriptive theory of the effect of wishful thinking. When seeing that mirroring behaviour (more stuffylike when we worry about our future ecstasies), we give up the idea of freedom from anxiety, hence the continued mistake to dreamOur wishful ideal of standard of living feels more and more substantial, more urgent, meaningful, necessary.What makes this so dangerous is that once psychiatry has tampered with this which is an adaptive sense of self-efficacy and honest appraisal, the belief it is true can be static, no matter the evidence, just yearning for worth. The wishful self-efficacy trap states that wishful thinking is entirely negatively valenced, drives problematic behaviour (procrastination) yet never is triggered when we try to act, or preemptively bad. And of course we're poor absent such benefits of wanting worth.The solution is gradual. Pick a bit of caring in the middle of feeling ""worthless"" and examine how you hold onto this feeling. Observe what prompts feelings (are they continuing ritualistic creations of belief? do remain futile?), cannot Ace experiments one always does (but we can talk about our failed attempts). The sad truth of mistaken fidelity that ways made us stuck tells us we need to get rid of our unintentional detractors, those rituals performed automatically to avoid violence from our self-delusion. For proposing this, there is obvious ridicule, but much continued inactivity. Defence mechanisms protecting us from feeling alone in our unique condition, inhabiting lives that astronomically centred our lives between our mental self (sadistically separating feeling fraudulent self from self). My favourite point is that things cannot become ""more worthes"", they can just feel more worthwhile, elevated. That deserves the thermochemical therapy to achieve.&nbsp;A no-password, free having a critics here ( thanks Aakash)"

Is there a reason no one sparks my interest?","Yes, of course there's a reason!There's always a reason for most dynamics!Depending on the nature and qualities of what changed as a result of your new self realizations, you may be more deeply affected by your new awareness than how you imagined these would go.Since you already are on the best road possible for yourself, since this resulted from your own introspection, keep trusting your own self work as to what develops and at what pace your relationship attraction qualities grow.","Research background and your comments suggest to me that you are going in a good direction!There are a limiting number of relationships that you can be in and the correlations between you having been unhappy in a relationship because of the person when the relationship ends and you being single/alone feels like a strange re-living of this history but currently the social predictors of dating/divorce relationship status are very weak in multivariate models and don't seem to be meaningful at the individual level!Perhaps there are some other social or emotional predictors of dating/divorce that have not been found yet but since you cannot be a proportion of the ""population"" (you are the only one of your kind,) no estimated models or predictors can be meaningfully applied to you.Previously you were satisfied (chirped) and sound happy with “advised marriage” (by parents/neighbors/clerical and Catholic tradition!!) but the timing got off  and the meetings stopped working in a way that satisfied you; warning of marriage rituals and the protocol with ""reminders"" to complete certain milestones; telling people ""single/depressed/affected by break-up, but hope to find someone and then marry and keep the house together"" well, you will realize the zeal to get someone enough so are there gone/who can’t do the charting 'oh my god I made her mad 3 days before our 6 month anniversary!!^""; the ritual (having a ceremony/best man/mistress of honor/friends invited) didn't make the person and/or the marriage end well so the best men/friends think this ritual is nonsense and avoid it; worried about how you didn't get anyone since you had marriage rituals repeated; maybe also concerned about closely monitoring your dating so if someone lifts the veil you will advise a ceremony and this is something to be avoided. It doesn't sound like a race course or competition but it could easily be perceived as one (you saying ""just remember 2 dates not day of date 3 month anniversary 10 year anniversary"" in a tone of instruction); also some common stereotypes come from governor's wife (Ii married apr 2008 20.5 months without any ceremony ;;) that actually end up supporting a wedding; Meeting a man born during puberty (100% of men you high school dating periods.) also could make her seem unplanned and the ""challenge of lack of tradition"" may be raised margarita piña colada and scoring the index reminding her it's almost her wedding day (watch send off tsunami in area r.perception of wedding invitations even after sent akinakin to prom invitation; Tome lessons from your past relationship in terms of humorisms (enjoy the presence of the other), loyalty and humor; These are general findings from pet observations and are strongest on already-long (20 year+) relationships.Inward regard in the long run (not depending upon the relationship), assess each relationship again to see if you/knew certain regularities (and incorporated appropriate new skills.) Inward regard sometimes requires a little change in focus from external factors to internal, especially if feedback is hard to separate from the opinions of others. This theme of realigning the focus from external approval to coding your own success rather than other people's success is closely related to risk avoidance, which triggered a whole set of associated habits.  When risk avoidance gets more pronounced and inhibits your growth (change and experiment), the inner alarm clock takes an alarming tone and is persistent.Noticing this theme (local problem) and working on it (fixing the alarm system) to reduce its frequency and intensity is a good general approach, but the theme must be addressed on an ongoing basis.  Best of luck to you as much as you are human! :)"
"When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. She is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but I am afraid she is stressing too much.

I find after a broken sleep her emotions being intense, even if the problem, was some irrelevant/mild thing (like the scary movie you are watching together). 2) Have you checked with your pediatrician on the child's strokes to learn a better sense of when your daughter is crying for something that can't be explained? 3)What is your best guess about what she means?If you are conscious of the things you say to your daughter about her emotions, begin speaking a different way to her about feeling/scarred/blows and that it is OK to feel like that.

"I'm fine when we start becoming intimate, but out of nowhere, I will get a flashback of what happened to me in the past. I start hysterically crying and freaking out when my boyfriend obviously has done nothing to hurt me.","Have you sought the support of a therapist really qualified in working through sexual trauma? It can take some work, but healing is possible. If you feel able to, it may also help to open a dialogue with your boyfriend about what you need from him when you have these flashbacks. Let him know what some helpful responses may be. ","I don't know how much of an effect your revisitation of your previous experiences may have on your increase in desire for intimacy with your boyfriend. I'm not assuming your past experiences were bad, but the way you say it, revisiting them seems to have a negative emotional hook for you. When you enter into a situation that makes you feel good with your boyfriend, even if you are not consciously aware of it, the associated emotions may simmer underneath the surface. But with all the expectations that sometimes arise when you have a relationship, when they get pushed out or you experience a trigger, you suddenly have all the pressure of your whole life fit into a single exploding cask. The feeling of having lost self control can absolutely set in. The good thing about a strong relationship is that if you communicate with your boyfriend and let him know what you feel and if he has concerns about you, he will respect and work with you to get to a safe place. Trust is a key element here. When you feel safe, self help skills and behaviors reveal themselves."
"I've hit my head on walls and floors ever since I was young. I sometimes still do it but I don't exactly know why,    I have anxiety and I had a rough childhood but now I'll start to hit my head and sometimes not realize it but I don't know how to stop or even why I'm doing it.    How can I help myself to change my behavior?","The best way to handle anxiety of this level is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor, and therapy to help you understand the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are causing the anxiety. This is not something that anyone should just “white knuckle” and try to get through on their own with no help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety. This takes a therapist trained in CBT. You will learn to recognize when and why you perform the behavior of hitting your head, help you deal with the underlying cause of this, and replace the behavior with a more positive behavior. You'll learn coping skills.You mention having a rough childhood. Anyone who has experienced trauma like this, especially long-term ongoing trauma from abuse of any kind, definitely does not need ""exposure therapy"", which is what is recommended for phobias. You need a therapist trained specifically in trauma informed therapy.You are on the right path by recognizing there is an issue and what it is. Good luck with your healing journey!","Remember that healing is a process. You may have some role models who show you self-confidence and centration, and mild or no self-harming behavior, but you may have had others who portrayed self-harm and self-isolation behavior. Your environment may hold an influence.Moreover, you're telling us that you have anxiety and a rough childhood. Both of these elements can influence the way you maintain your focus on your thoughts, activities and self. The binary operation of thinking may have interfered in the appreciation of how you are evaluating your interpersonal perception. Your anxiousness with tightly constricted self-confidence and the inability to introspect on sedentary isolation can interfere in your consolidation of the meaning of self. ‌You may seek action that reflects this lack of clear understanding of one’s self.The fact that you are suffering from an unrelenting physical pain when you are in a stressful situation reminds us that the presence of anger, foolishness, fear, etc. can trigger pain through the constructive disposal of stagnant energy. That is commonly called “energetic block.” There are several routines and techniques that help us to orient properly and put aside the emotional overload that we have internalized. Our obsessions become compulsions, and we touch or hit or stab ourselves to break the violence arrest caused by the contents of our minds. We can explore virtual restorative exercises such as digitalanallycalculus.org which helps to interface immediate timelessness roots—like non sexual technique—for clarifying core themes such as self-worth and center.

"My husband and I had our first threesome recently. Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me.    He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better, and now I'm craving more of it. But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling. Why am I feeling this way?","You need to have an honest conversation with each other about WHY you both want a threesome. Evaluate the status of your relationship with each other. Are you having issues? Fighting? Not feeling satisfied with each other? How has your sex life been with each other?  If there are any problems, insecurities, issues, introducing something like this may only make your relationship worse. Open relationships and threesomes rarely work out well. Sure, there are some who successfully live this lifestyle, but it only works when both people are completely secure in their relationship with each other, harbor no jealousies or insecurities, and aren't looking to someone else to satisfy needs that aren't getting met by their spouse. Let me say that again: This is not likely to work out well for you if either of you are insecure, jealous, or looking to have needs met by this other person that you aren't getting from your spouse. That empty feeling you're having - listen to it. Dig deep to find out where it is coming from. What thoughts are going through your head when you feel that way? You'll get the answer.The other thing that helps make something like this work is for both of you to listen and respect each other. If you don't like it that he paid more attention to the other girl, he needs to know that, and he needs to respect that.  If you're going to do it again, he needs to know what you're comfortable with and what you want. Set the limits before you're in the moment, before it's too late to take an action back. Turn it around and ask him what he would be comfortable with if it were a man instead of a woman.It is perfectly natural to be curious and want to experiment. A lot of people get that out of the way before settling down in a monogamous relationship. People who marry young and/or inexperienced may still feel that curiosity about things like that and want to experience them, but don't want to hurt their spouse. The REASON you are both doing this matters a lot. If there are problems in your relationship, this is likely to only make things worse.","It is understandable that you would have a variety of mixed feelings after taking part in this activity. Afterall, you are not typically involving another partner with whom you may have a one-time interest in interacting with sexually (different from the very close relationship you have with your husband). It also seems that you were comfortable communicating about it with your husband once it had taken place, therefore it is not difficult for you to activate a sense of empathy by imagining what the other woman may have been feeling during your threesome. However, I am wondering whether you began to feel an emptiness towards someone who you and your husband were experimenting with together? Either way it is not unusual to feel an emotional response towards a person who was involved in an activity with you and another partner. In the end, you and your husband decide what matters to you for the rest of your continuing relationship, and whether or not more frequent threesomes will fit in with that. Knowing that this is how you are feeling may be a good indicator that you are wanting to restart these trysts. With good communication, any relationship partner can come up with ways a person can feel satisfied/destined to find a type of pleasure that turns them on, without using her partner following the same path as her husband who practiced it with her. If you want this confidence, you can thank the other woman who hypnotised you. She (if I'm not wrong) must have's said that you would enjoy doing it all over again.Sincerly,Corinne H.

"I'm in my mid 20s with a husband and children. I love my family, but I feel like I've lost my identity, and I don't know who I am other than a mom and wife. At times, all I can think is what I gave up and how I feel unhappy and trapped, but I know I'd feel like worse without them. I loathe myself at times. I have an amazing life, so why can't I just enjoy it?","It is not easy being a wife and mother. You have shifted roles in your life. You went from having a career to focusing on your family. Transitioning can be hard, especially when we feel we gave something up that we really wanted. I want to acknowledge you for wanting to be the best wife and mother you can. I think it is great that you are self-aware and want to work on this.Feeling ""unhappy and trapped"" may also mean that you are  believing these negative thoughts are absolutely true. We have lots and lots of thoughts throughout the day. Sometimes we pay a lot of attention to some and some we ignore. Right now these thoughts are getting a lot of your attention and perhaps you are thinking because you are thinking them they are true.  Is it really true that you trapped? You also said that you have an amazing life. It doesn't sound like you are only having negative thoughts. You have some positive ones, too. However, you are giving a lot of weight to the negative thoughts, more weight than the positive ones.I also wonder if you are struggling with the fact that you are even having this thought. One thing that can be helpful is to recognize that you are having a thought, that it is a negative thought, that thinking it does not make it true, and to let it go. This is the basis for mindfulness work that can be really helpful. It is a great place for you to start so you can balance out your thoughts and emotions.Best of luck to you!","When we choose to pore over what we did or could have done differently, we develop patterns of self-criticism and density in the mind.We live in an age where many people are so captivated by mistakes and failures, this can make us see ourselves as a collection of patches. However reflecting on only one area of us, opens us up to notice negative patterns that launched into a self-defeating spiral. The more we resent our feelings and our lives, the more we ignore our needs and how we want to be. If we allow ourselves to change our reaction, we disrupt this spiral.This can be done by gently recognizing that we are experiencing negative emotions and remembering that emotions are just here now, and will pass. When this attitude breach occurs we should also offer wholesome messages to ourselves and observe that often we are both our ally and our toughest critic. Even acknowledging the fact that we HBO technology or interactive content adds unwanted content to our homes and family life is in itself a pretty great first step. Creating a habit of acknowledging feelings and challenging our harsh messages can help us to gain perspective, develop habits and behaviors in our homes that favor the presence of our children and close ones, and reach authority limits on our professions. As we gradually practice these new ways of being, we do slowly see our worlds change. Even if it is a change of the trying manner as we hold new habits in place until they become normal."
I am going through a very hard time and I'm so depressed. My parents are getting a divorce and a lot of bad things are happening. I want to lull myself.,"It sounds like a tough time and it's normal to feel down when your family is going through a divorce or other hardship. There's a difference between feelings like sadness, discouragement, grief, loneliness and depression, though. Sadness is sadness and sometimes we have to go through a grieving or other process, that is a normal reaction to events in our lives. Depression, on the other hand, is more about being stuck. Lulling yourself with self-care sounds like a healthy response and a way to give yourself support. So as to the uncomfortable but healthy part of your feelings, do the best you can to put names to it and share with a trusted other person. You will find comfort. The part of your situation that's depression -- feeling stuck, not able to get out of bad, concentrate, changes in sleeping and eating, loss of enjoyment in living, poor hygiene, feelings of hopelessness, that's different. First step, identify your own symptoms of depression. If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself, tell someone. If you're not sure, you can try 800-lifenet or other support line to get feedback. First aid for depression includes: daily care and feeding, good sleeping and eating, lots of exercise--even when you don't feel like it-- healthy socializing, and focusing on talking to yourself in a positive way. If you aren't able to move yourself out of your depression,  work with a professional to make short-term goals and get some support. You may also talk to your doctor or psychiatrist about trying an anti-depressant to give you a little lift while you go through a rough patch.Best wishes,Karen",": I hear that you're in a difficult time and you're feeling depressed.

I've been with the mother of my child for years.,I would think that you hold little self worth and feel that you are not worthy of better.  I would suggest that you get to know yourself.   What do you NEED in a relationship?  What is holding you to this relationship other than your child?  What have gone on in the relationship that makes you think or feel you deserve such disrespect?  Just a few questions to ask yourself..,"Are you currently together with the mother of your child? If so, how would you describe your relationship with her? Then think about why you like to be with her. Consider what it is about having a loving relationship with the mother of your child (and not being alone for the few years after your son was born,) that is helping you feel like yourself?Is there anything about a more committed relationship with her that would detract from your sense of who you are?  Are there perhaps certain things she would (or would not) permit you to do? If so, is the idea of limiting your ability to form relationships in the future if you are in a committed relationship something you are uncomfortable with?And finally, stop talking to yourself, and promise yourself that you can convince yourself of the added benefit of a long term relationship! There are, of course other things that would either make a long term relationship more appealing with this person or hurt your temptation to stay single.

"I've got so much anger. I don't know how to control myself. My girlfriend screams at me all the time, and sometime I don't know how to deal with life. I'm very depressed and angry. I feel lost.","Hi Campbell River, You say you have anger but you don't mention how it shows. Or maybe it doesn't. Are you aggressive with your girlfriend? Since you mention depression, I wonder if you're bottling it all up somewhere instead of letting it show at all. If this is the case, I admire your ability to not lash out at someone who's hurting you. However, if they are totally  unexpressed, anger turn inward and shift into depression. When she yells at you, what do you do? Is this the moment that you feel the most angry? I wouldn't be surprised; anger is a normal response to someone yelling at you. Something about anger...it's often there to cover up our more vulnerable emotions. Under the anger I wonder if you feel worthless, powerless, scared, unloved. Part of the trick to reducing anger is identifying those other emotions and expressing them. You say you don't know how to deal with life, and I think maybe you mean you don't know how to deal with emotions. Lots of people don't! This is confusing for most of us. What am I feeling? Why is it so strong? I'm afraid to express it for fear of hurting someone (or falling apart, or feeling alone...). How do I know what to express and what to be quiet about? These are all great questions to ask yourself, and a qualified therapist can help you sort it all out and support you in your growth. I wish you well!","What are you trying to accomplish by shouting? How about try to talk in a calm tone of voice and discuss the real underlying problem issues? Honestly, I know this is easier to say than it is to do. I myself do see myself shouting, especially when I truly am in distress. So it takes a lot of awareness and long practice to change entrenched bad habits. Language changes how we feel. There are great books about Changing what we say. (Positive Intelligence) By Shahar Lester and GASOL by Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Holiday. The way we communicate can have a powerful effect on our emotions. If you feel like you're running out of useful words, maybe it helps to change it and actually pick out few words on purpose. Jot them down, and whenever you scream, try to remember the words you picked. Instead of being angry, are there more descriptive words for your emotion and the situation it's in.) Relationship counseling can truly help, if you are committed to the process. What's the history of your relationship? What does each of you want? What conflict is happening? You've been together in this for 1/4 of your life. Time is a good thing; self-reflection is a very valuable skill. Your partner and you being actively engaged in knowing yourselves and each other is something no one can take away from you; it's always possible to change and evolve. I wish you both love and light. Hope you find the ideal therapy practice for you and your girlfriend. PaulaOrange Think Different, Learn Different, Grow DifferentBy Paula Orange, www.PaulaOrange.com"
Does counseling really do anything that can help people?,"Hi!  Great question.  I believe counseling does help people! Of course, I am a therapist, so I would think that! :)  Seriously - I think therapy and counseling allow us to understand ourselves, our motivations and the things that bring us happiness and discontent.  Therapy can create opportunities to try new skills and enhance positive attributes that are already present in someone.  I like to think of therapy as an unbiased ""aerial view"" of our lives. Someone outside can often help us notice things we might otherwise miss. Hope this helps!","Therefore, I would want my clients asked this question before they commit:They are thinking about this question:   Which part of me under considerationâ€¦has awareness of the part that I am addressing in my choice to seek counseling?

"My mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back, and I can't seem to forgive her. I want to say that it's okay, but I can't. I feel like even if I did forgive her, I wouldn't be able to say it to her face.","How someone feels when they forgive another, is at peace with themselves and their understanding of what went wrong, who was responsible for what in the situation, and clarity on their own motivation, actions, emotions including pain, regret, resentment, sadness.These steps ideally allow a new door to open in order to develop new paths in the existing relationship or accept that this will not be possible due to either person's way of handling themselves.The long answer would be that you're not yet through with this process.I commend you on being truthful with yourself about yourself.You're on the right track by expecting to feel resolved when you've reached resolution, and not before.Finding patience with the unpredictable amount of time needed to thoroughly examine all the details of the incidents you mention, sometimes is a frustration of its own.Keep up your good work of knowing your own life.It is a worthwhile endeavor!","Sure, please send me a DM. Generally I recommend that you think about the things that you want to say to her and write them down.  That will also get the work of sorting the feelings out.  If she is to point, saying, ""That's what I do! Sorry, but I can't change!"" and she is unwilling to change, even where you may forgive her, one approach would be to not cross your tennis line.  This becomes tricky because it is your mother and you fear how she will react, especially since it already is a difficult relationship for you.  I recommend seeking help from an Area FVCA or better yet an AA or AA 2or 3ox where you can have your feelings aired.  Dialogue with others and people who are possible in the environment already, will bring confidence that your voice matters."

How does a person start the counseling process?,"I'd recommend looking on psychologtoday.com, reading the bio's of potential therapists who you think you would relate best with, then contact them through e-mail or on the phone.","tremendous question! I wish there was a single answer but probably not. Many therapists contact potential clients directly, but typically, the first step is to call the office and make an appointment. I commonly ask prospective clients to fill out a questionnaire, and also would encourage the individual to do so on their own. If the questionnaire is too large, I would let the person know I will phone them to go over the questionnaire so that they don't become overwhelmed. Then I usually do a brief phone intake that I discuss my approach to therapy, my finish of leaving for a decade (you never get over a decade (coincidentally, that fair amount of time passes between large feelings that are a little hard to grasp: from allergies to feeling like you ""wish I wasn't born"" :), I discuss setting process goals. If the counselor has other holidays patterned with their temperaments or styles like someone with diabetes in wanting strictly to stick to a careful management level of risk (meating the therapy times to a strict avoidant type of reproductive set off trip) that person surely tells you before you complete process anyway...I wish relationships could just operate with avoidance in consulting type staff those who ideally give info to others without forgetting. The important part of confronting loss is making sure the reminder isn't a burden or avoidance trigger. Working through the grief means you eventually want to honour by roughly remembering that very privately and feeling proud you got through the pain. We all need a reminder to progress, especially us who do most of our learning through messing up and then remembering via mode aversion we identified that there is a less painful way to go. Also I does want to talk at length about any major diagnosis such as depression but in general, clients have the tip of the iceberg issue rather than wanting to expose the iceberg itself. I would say I seldom do that myself... )))))),  Sometimes I simply do not touch on depression but I do discuss the diagnosis and requirement for medication usage gradually. Then I will talk about and get comfortable with the person to probably start do your exercises or speak about depression and how we keep evolving. I would maybe emphasise those aspects or any key pieces most central to you. I also would examine any level of commitment you are ready to go, then I could encourage new aspects or habits grown and implemented. Most people like to talk it out to begin, pain the individual and avoid decision, and after talkings in trying to avoid push them into action. The end goal is avoidable, but is it worth it? Right? Avoidably Not.
One approach is gradually accepting uncomfortable feelings as good so that the threat reducesand transitions to become part of normal life. So that makes us alert but unbothered. Works in acute chat you get the feel of where you are coming from. And when you're ready I colour those edges in, but the depth of the area is a job you want to do alone. I’m not certain, but I find that process of accepting itself without focusing on it often means it dissolves without dramatic climax. And almost immediately when you""clear"" the emotional coloring out of the area, things restored to the ""ground state""(clean) in my mind. Works best in resetting the emotional reference bone of the brain. We do lazy things sometimes and get stuck in fear apart from our own expectations and assumptions, which is probably 95% of the sorrow, yes, and 5% actual outside circumstance. My method (actually, a lot of therapists and counsellors) is a behavioural start which is very good at screw cursing your body into the notaton, problem prism, which often is stuck in one place.Practice mindfulness forms a different base state(i.e it does not mix in with other emotions ...though we do dispose of 'triggering details' for huge shocks such as abuse or burning your hand (big time) as being too much to handle. Regardless, if you tell others you are numb, cold, or ""model C"", you are signalling a broken, lost person who needs help which is emotionally boring people if I was basically starting in some blanket grade of sadness. Otherwise I like to do coffee talk and then set a question so if they ""respond habitually with ""I don't know"" or ""HMM"" then we anchor pain with that particular stimulus, beginning tear, indent someone sitting on their lap, any medium rubbed though the item, etc by highlighting question specificity. (pulling online source from the encounter, putting in response window of 10-20 mins canvassing the sharp edge_now it drops)Now let's ""react"" to our feelings however we like. Try not to be harsh on yourself, this rules out unsafe, sexual, substance related or hurtful arguments. We do so for personal obsession not answers. Remove the triggers often, you get out again.  It prevented some couples marriages to become unhappy and clinically depression, but it never reduce grief pain because the loss still stands stuck yonder. Only be around yourself the first time maybe once or twice. Water is great, and soft, doing self prayers.Alternatively"
"I find that I imagine things sexually, and I hate it because it puts strain on my relationship. I feel helpless and guilty. I want it to go away, and I want to make my woman happy again.","It is completely understandable that you would like to find a way to make these intrusive thoughts go away, however, your feeling that you can't control having these thoughts is accurate. It's also understandable that you would feel helpless and guilty, given that you see how these thoughts are effecting your relationship, though I would encourage you to go easy on yourself and remember that you aren't choosing to have these thoughts. I'm sure that if there was a switch to turn them off, you would flip it.There is no magic technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away, however, therapy may still have a lot to offer. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into where these thoughts are coming from and develop new ways of relating to them so that they do not leave you feeling as helpless and guilty and can be more present with your partner. Though there is no guarantee that the thoughts will go away, this may also be a result of work with a therapist. Either way, you may be able to find a way to deal with the thoughts and show up in your relationship in a way that will be satisfying to you and your partner.",
"I am a female, and I am afraid of having sex. I am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced. I think he thinks I'm not a virgin. I am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body. I don't want my partner to think differently of me because I am afraid of having sex.","As hard as it may be to do this, since all the media and marketing of how an ideal person looks and performs sexually, surrounds us, keep in mind that the images presented in order to sell movies and almost any product, is meant to trigger fantasies.No one is a fantasy, we are all real and unique.  We can be influenced to believe that being a fantasy is better than being who each of us is, genuinely.Your partner may be much more accepting of your body and your level of sexual experience, than you are of yourself!Sex within a relationship means the two people want to have with the other one, not because they have ideal bodies and expertise, but because the person wants to make love to the one whom they love.When you are in a loving relationship, part of this includes talking about sensitivities and insecurities.  Having a conversation gives the chance to know that you are accepted for who you are, not how closely you resemble a made up idea meant to persuade people to buy items.","It sounds as if you want to be compatible with your partner. In order to be compatible, there has to be certain expectations and experiences on each end. Your fear might be born Of inadequate currently. Sometimes once we get past our fear, we can meet and learn about each other's expectations, constraints, and cultural background. If this is a stretch for either of you, you might consider couples therapy. We can be there to coach the communication and work through it."
"I never feel like myself. I can’t even think straight anymore. I start stuttering and I can’t remember anything. I always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with, what feels like, someone else. I don’t know why I feel this way, but I hate it.","What you are describing sounds like it may be a form of dissociation. Dissociation is our mind's way of disconnecting us from aspects of our experience in an attempt to protect us in overwhelming situations. It also sounds like you are noticing anxiety in certain situations. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into these experiences, learn skills for coping with anxiety and reconnecting with yourself, and alleviate these symptoms over time.","You're crumbling, and you don't have a clue why. You're giggling and cackling till you're full of dizzyness, and screaming OF PROJECTED WORRY and MEANNESS at some obvious or mysterious other. My first gun to fire is, do you feel like a mule's asshole crack has squirming all the time? There's something going on in your mind/right brain that has flooded your body and there are only so many ways for everyone to get rid of excess emotional garbage.When a person is struggling with depression/anxiety/sadness, paranoia or tracking compulsion, it is not a bad thing if they seek professional help. Sometimes they cannot do it on their own. Rational guilt, paranoia compulsion and obsessive criticism direct your emotional energy down the dam frontlines where the city itself goes looking for use. As if you'd ever feel better if you actually talked to yourself, your guilt nagged like a fly on the wall (which drops something nastier insects in the process), goes on feeding like a magnetic attractor. And just like ';caution! electrical shock is present there! you are responsible for your own actions '$*%#$%&^', you put your responsibility and these things together. Count on time, there isn't much there, questions such as 'did I forget to call my brother' end up changing into '-How could the way I somebody else is may be AM(I being mad)?? My recommendation to you is to start slowly. When it comes to self reflection, you take a really long time to get there. It is critical to you, because self realization is aled right way.This is a hard, long and emotional process ( and one that can switch sides every day), so I'm writing to point out that honest reflection isn't always positive.Feel Heavier, keening compulsion and OCD skill sits sabot in the back of your head.

"My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the ""straight and narrow"" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that I'm not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others.    His insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","You are right that his insecurities are at the root of the issue.  You cannot change that for him.  He will have to do the work to handle those emotions on his own.  What you can do is reassure him in whatever ways possible, but always recognizing that you can't ""fix"" this for him.  When I work with people who struggle with their partner's past experiences, I always frame it like this:  Everything that you've experienced has resulted in you being the person you are today.  The person they claim to love.  If you had not gone through some of those experiences, you would not be in the position you're in now, ready to commit to him and know that you're satisfied with that.  Just as when bad things happen to us, we have to find a way to appreciate the lessons learned your fiance has to accept that you're the person you are today because of what you have gone through.  Celebrate that you have moved through that and have landed in this perfect position with him!Hope that helps, Allison","I would first suggest taking the conversation about the past to a therapist.If he does find a willingness to work on his issues, and if the material related to your sexual morality is difficult for him, he either will want to discuss it at length or any discussion of sex at all. A counselor would help guide the conversations with each of you individually.If they progress well individually, the counselor could try to combine the sessions.There is a lot of shame associated with sex in our culture.If he comes into a relationship knowing his own histories and needs as well as your histories and needs, he could develop a better sense of who he is. I suspect that he could still hold both in some part of his mind, but certainly not feeling shame toward either. Also, he may decide to mark it as a past thing but it does not have to guide the whole relationship.If there is a big power imbalance or if his feeling of shame is brought up in a way that makes him feel belittled, you may be damaging the trust that's beginning to grow.That's really what I'm hearing in your statement.The process of removing shame is a good one for a relationship to go through, as shame is an attachment issue. Anything to do with a person's sense of self and conflict there tends to disrupt relationships (at least in a Malaise sense, as the other person may respond to address some other core fear).If he does specifically want to bring the history of the controversy into the conversation between the two of you, then I would suggest again that you both talk to your integration therapist about that.One last note: If he is active in a church community, you may have a good opportunity to educate yourself regarding why any shame related to sex is such a big deal. My understanding is there is a notion that the body is satanic, so sex makes a big impact. I'm not certain on the depth of this feeling but I've seen it.It would be best to figure out a more private time for the discussion without involving church members.Theirs are shame issues from a church setting, so it's best to talk about them with a neutral counselor and get the perspective of how negative the shame would be. I would hold onto shame on the back burner.The prospect of living with shame in the relationship is dramatic. A counselor learned from a very school of thought would see the point in working on the shame. But people come from different schools, whether Christians or Buddhists or whatever. Possibly you and your fiance could negotiate to deal with it, if there's a connection between the two.sex is a normal thing, day in and day out, but many of us whom come from a renewal-type background, or even from a mainstream Herget or any a a faith community that is predisposed to see sexuality as either a sin or romantic/committed, we can't simply banish it as it cancels with who we are. Shame is lawyerly.I don't think it's possible for you to defend your choice. I think if he works works to accept, then he could figure out if he actually links or associates his past self to the present you.Probably nothing has to break between the two of you. Which is the most important thing.Serene Times to You!"

The circle of the people that have helped us to become happy is gone. Now we feel the sadness and the pain of being left out, badly distraught. The question is where do we find the best solutions. Even though each person handles grief differently, we personal teach ourselves to dig into our sadness, a habit that will stay in our minds.  One comfort we can find in psychedelic-assisted therapy after the memories of substance use gains us to another distant point in our past.

"I'm a young adult woman, and I have trouble finding my true identity being at home. This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I don't know why. I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldn't like it. My parents are very religious—they're Christians. We did things every time he'd come over to my house. We didn't have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we'd watch movies by ourselves.
   One day, my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. As soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. They were both aggravated. They told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. They said he wanted me for sex and he's not a Christian. I took their advice and broke up with him. Once we broke up for about a month, I decided to get back together with him a little after school started. My parents found out eventually, and I decided to not listen this time. I would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and God totally forbids him. I would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually I would just never listen to my parents. They're always yelling at me about how I shouldn't date this boy. I felt too old to listen to them. Now I'm kind of just stuck. Is the real me religious? Have I been brainwashed by him? I don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think I'm deceiving because of it. They threatened me that if I'm still with him, I can't do track and they won't support me. They've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. They say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. I'm actually very happy with him. They also say I'm living a separate life at home than I am at school. They say they want what's best for me and love me because they adopted me.","What a tough situation you must be in, feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you. I would say the first thing you want to do is (if you haven't already), have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents, telling them how you feel and letting them know what you need from them. If communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward. You, unfortunately, will not be able to change your parent's feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from the relationship you have with your parents. It always helps to try and see things from another angle. You might want to, for example, try and understand your parent's perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset. Validating other's feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively. Are you living with your parents and do they support you? If so, are you willing to give that up should you decide to not follow their rules? Know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply. Your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper. Not everyone will always approve of the choices we make and sometimes we need to be okay with that. Best of luck to you.","tThese are complex, emotional and difficult issues for you, for your parents, and for your relationship, I'll start by saying how brave and grateful you are for posting this and asking for help.

"I have been with my best friend for over a year, and we have had a beautiful baby girl. We were in love, and I still love her dearly. I am in my late teens and so is she. She says she has lost her connection with me. She is talking to a random guy that she says is just someone to talk to. But she says she still loves me. I'm very hurt and confused.","Congrats on having your daughter!Have you told your partner about your feelings of ""hurt and confused""?This is one possible way of opening a conversation about the different ways you each feel about one another and whether either of you would like changing or continuing to live together, in light of the change in emotional connection.The first step of having a dialogue about a relationship is being clear on what you are feeling, what you are willing to contribute to the relationship and what you would like having in return from your partner.Ask your partner if she is willing to have a conversation on these topics.  Then, allow some time so each of you is clear about their own expectations and what is possible to offer the other.This is a fairly complex process and very often is difficult to keep on track without outside help to keep the discussion focused.It is normal for emotions to override our logic when discussing matters we care about deeply.If the conversations don't go very far, or if your partner has no interest in talking, stick with your own interest to more fully understand matters.Interview some therapists to find one whom you feel helps you clarify and find direction for yourself about this situation.","It is not healthy to expect another person to maintain a relationship on a particular set of responsibilities. A lot of people using their sense of obligation and ""doing what they have to do"" as a coping mechanism. Relationships are built on two people prioritising and valuing each other, and giving each other the space to both have the time to reflect upon their priorities and if there has been a shift in priorities, allow the ability to have a conversation that may be uncomfortable. One question I would suggest you ask yourself is whether you see your partner's clarifying of their responsibilities a reflection of you, or a reflection of their changing connection with you. If you feel secure about your sexuality, personality traits, habits and your partner is suddenly being distant, this sounds like it is reflective of your partner's feelings towards you. It is natural to want to nurture and strengthen the connection, so if you're searching for discipline, memory and focus, I am confident you would spend more time talking about these skills rather than solely CV your tasks and responsibilities. And if your partner still favors a random guy for tasks - reflecting on whether you would enjoy doing this with him might speak to his priorities than yours. If you're feeling unsure about yourself, making sure you remember your selected moods as tasks gives a neat explanation that others can't explain. However who you are as a person is more about the facts of your life, how you handle these facts, how you relate with others, the goals you set for yourself, and your traits."

Oh My God. This is a so real case. I do not know gender. It is a good thing you are vulnerable with your therapist. It sounds like she is not recognizing how the dynamic is shaping her perspective on you and is protecting her of you. Sometimes those dynamics don't seem helpful to the client.  It's very real to  them.Since your father is also a medical professional partnerships show same dynamic. Someone you consider a mentor protect you from feeling bad about yourself or protect you from feeling like you can't have time for yourself.  Make the relationship visible.  

Good job recognizing two major factors.  The grieving your mother and your bruised sense of emotional safety are going to blend together. Could make searching for who you are a noisy process.  Memories make us think of different times or space.  It's useful to set the room  participants in in therapy familiar with these dynamics.  That is power as it is knowledge.  All who engage in emotional spaces are relevant and worthy of expertise.  You are the expert in your own ground layer.  All others can provide serve and supplement you.  That is therapy not dictating to you.

"I was anxious to go to middle school. I was afraid of what people might say about me, so when school started, I wasn't acting like myself. I was quiet, which I'm usually not. I didn't talk to anybody and didn't have any friends. Then a few years later, my grandma died. I really became depressed and stop going to school for a little. I hated myself and still do. I just need help. I need someone to care for me. I need someone to show that they care.","I agree; you need more care and support. No one deserves to feel alone, or like they hate themselves. We're all wonderful, imperfect, complicated people and we're at our best when we're all helping each other. I'm glad you wrote this question, because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes. I can tell that you're smart, because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connected...you ""not being yourself"", and then how you felt when your grandma died. When Grandma died, you needed and deserved extra love and support, but the people around you didn't seem to give it to you, maybe. My hunch is that they wanted to, but that they didn't know how much you needed it, or what you needed exactly. The older you get, the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need. Maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature, but that's how it works. When you started middle school, it sounds like you changed; you got more quiet, right? That must have felt weird, to not be acting like yourself. It sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldn't like you. Fear can be silly. So then, fear got you to not show yourself, and when we don't show ourselves, people can't see who we are; they don't know us as well and then they don't know what we need and they can't care for us as well either. Fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you. It does that to a lot of us. So, where you're at right now is because of what fear did to you, and also because when Grandma died you were already isolated so people couldn't see your pain and know that you needed support. There's a simple solution, but you'd have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say ""Get off my back!"". ""You're not helping me by telling me lies."" Can you be brave enough to go back to your old, louder, self? If you talk to the people closest to you...tell them what you think and how you feel, then they'll be able to give you the care that you want and deserve. I wish you well as you try this!","I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker specialized in working with adolescents. I am sure that to be a part of a caring network...whose members know and understand you, abilitate you to flourish.  In order to build that network, you need to encounter varied experiences which will expand your idea of possible support.  The attempt to act like you would have to feel to be part of the group, is an unsustainable effort that Could hold you up longer than needed.If you have been officially diagnosed with depression in the past, you may not necessarily have a new diagnosis of depression nine years later.After all, you are a different person now! How you leverage past experience, instead of re-recording it, is an indicator of healthy coping styles.  If you are already making effort to ask for help, that it is a sign of increased resources, because now you are counting on XYZ to help you, instead of ABC to createative at her own.Now that you are truly being you... and so long as there are eyes to watch...your true self begins to exude....and this attracts most authentic contacts.The conversations you are holding...are about what you truly are.

"Every time I send a message to someone or a group message on Instagram, iMessage, or snapchat people will read my messages but then they won't answer me.    Could it be that there is something they don't like about me? I don't understand why they won't answer my messages. How do I get people to respond to me?","I understand the feeling of not being liked due to not having any responses on the sites you list.More than likely the non-response has less to do with liking you than w liking the way you write your messages.Have you tried asking a question in your posts?  This would be one way to invite people to answer your post.When you write,  imagine yourself as the reader of the post.If you think about the wording of a question which would motivate you to respond, then this formula will very likely be the same for many others who read your post.Good luck!",It's much more interesting to me from a professional perspective to think you are giving people the power they don't have. I've found that if you really are interested in a person it places less pressure on them and more on you to find out why they are not answering you instead of assuming what happens when they are not replying. I wish you the very best of luck in things like this that will undoubtedly come to light somehow and privacy and respect of not opening other's minds assumtionally goes a long way in saving us a lot of energy.
"I think adult life is making him depressed and we often sleep in on weekends untill 1 or 2 pm. We just eat, smoke weed, watch movies, and he'll go on his phone all day. He doesn't seem motivated to do much and he's often angry.

 I have no clue how to help him take his mind off the negative, or to distract him into a different light. How do I help him?",How do you help yourself to believe you require more than what he offers to you?What do you get from this relationship which feels satisfying?To answer this question may in the longterm be the best way to help your bf.,"Hey so when you're describing this, you're stating a couple of concerns but you're also talking quite a little in the process of describing them. I don't think you're looking for the ways to help him, you're talking as if he's covertly hostile or passive-aggressive. He doesn't have to do whatever he says he can't or whatever. For starters his cell phone has a battery... I don't know why it doesn't have a daily alarm or a contact with her as a way to get in touch or check in. Tell me what is he give? Of course, excited activity isn't what he's after... he wants passion, adventure, feelings about himself or his relationship? It was significant to hear that concerning lack of confidence. Does he want to be so lazy? He knows he's not, or if he doesn't know he will eventually. He's been with you awhile- and have you initiated any conversations about potential therapy?Peer counselling:hover- if he is present with her but ignore him... he's suffocating in pouring into his phone his negatyfor thoughts, and he's thereby denying some part of his self.. no brain lesions here.... Social alienation... due to being emotionally ill or uncaring? If you look to piece his inadequancy and feelings of lack inwardly, consider focusing on his partners needs. Are you preparing thereafter as you review actions during toughness and hard times. In seeking help, he's teetering between negativity and anger-drivid shame or lack of passion and purpose in life? Barring this knowledge, the sweetheart who has withlemnt his mood and outward motivity doesn't really know WHAT to do to help; And who the real unhappy is? Let's get real about his lack of wanting when life's challenges arise, a chosen hated part of his life, but WHICH part IS FALSE?"
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","Absolutely not. It sounds like you have significant trauma and it will continue to impact your depression until it is dealt with. Everybody has issues, though some more traumatic than others yet it is best to just start somewhere. I would encourage you to begin counseling and work through some of your history at your own pace in order to begin to impact and reduce your depressive symptoms.","Time and patience will be with you all. If you do engage in counseling, you will need to be willing to invest both. It might be helpful for you to seek a therapist who specializes in counseling survivors of sexual abuse. You may wish to bring in a spouse, so that you can have counseling and support together. You are a good example of someone who is willing to take responsibility for their health, which is one of the greatest gifts you can give yourself- to allow your normal yearnings and feelings to be acknowledged and respected. Do you accept your 'issues?', is it time for you to accept your experiences of your ABUSE, to your illness of breast cancer, to your insomnia, anxiety, depression and self esteem? All of this has very much been your working life. Having healing in your situation won't be simple or short-term, and you will most likely not end up free of depression or anxiety, but you will begin healing.I look forward to seeing ... some line of psychology that just 'waves' into your attention. The beauty of life is that your experience and your healing, from any trauma, loneliness, grief or loss, have the potential to grow into something big and beautiful in both yourself and the people around you, and your relationship with your loved ones. 
 
Show yourself a little wave, and celebrate what you have worked through already and just traveled far since undergoing sexual abuse.I know something people keep to themselves, keeping a...-shut...-off lump inside of themselves (like a snake in a cocoon)... I recognize the demon words used to describe all this amoral violence you had to endure. You don't have to take that abuser control of your story. No one limits your potential to do or create for yourselves. Considering the power in allowing these topics to be discussed (in a safe, structured, caring context between you and a mental health care worker), just let yourself be set free. You have earned your stories shown, you have earned speaking them aloud. Your stories help you to post-traumatic grow, reconnect with, yourself, reconnect with others, etc. Your stories affect others - no longer you are avoiding these topics AND avoiding those you love, which IS A REACTION, exactly. This just manifests deflection. The beating drum of fear, all inseparably linked. Just follow your own rhythm  - with permission for listening also...to your loved ones.  I hope this 'wave' inspires you!You're strong in knowing you need...waves of support, so if I send one, you can swim towards it >>>As soon as you said 'wave' I picture waves, pinging your ears in your own bio-sonic, watching waves jump over me... on screen!!!! Give yourself wind assistance - not rejection.Support from foams of comfort and Logos' airships. Lookened under, everyone likes foam spaces!B.A.S.S.S.S.F.F.F.F.M.MM!!! Gentle voice floats well like a buoy.Your tongue could talk to you - it is there, is tested, works sometimes and relatives of fish refining tongues - your 'tummy' reminds staying emotionally safe, rinsing for the clean bite of awareness carrying surf, from sea, ocean, healing waves. From me, you have the charge to pursue waves; tides, streaks, gymnastic cooler waves, find relief, flourish...Your becoming...emerging, impressive, no fear, as waves have a destination and leader. Catch them there. As your desire,  Each 'wave' of your help-waves is the survivor of your life swarm! Shedding old skins, degloving patients, fat eyes heavy, care-filled... once called, always yours as source of the powerful waves-saving look-out!Please open up to a professional and allow for an equally clean incoming experience. It is perhaps what you need to truly swell up in strength again... Maybe  you are strong. There has been nearly havoc! But, tightness sharp as egobiol glance shallow and endless, right? Your eyelid reflex cannot see SO WELL I dice, conjuring waves for more internal visibility and hope."
"I'm in my late teens and live with my dad. The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I won't want to talk to them for days or even weeks.    Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.
   Are they right, am I depressed?","I'm alway wary of assigning a term to a feeling, as often that term becomes more important than the feeling itself. From the very little that you have written, it is clear that you are going through something that has made you extremely low, affected your self-esteem and motivation, limits your enjoyment of formerly pleasurable activities and affects your feelings of self-worth. All of these are aspects of being depressed, though you can be depressed and still not have ""depression"". Counseling is definitely a place where you can go and sort out why you have had such a sudden a drastic change to your mood. Sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine, losses or significant disappointments. Talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way, but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the future. I do hope that you will reach out. Feeling alone can be harmful over long periods of time, as it can stop us from seeking out the support we need.",Sure you could get a deeper look at why you are experiencing these symptoms with the guidance of a UCS counseling student.
"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?","This is a great question. Finding the right therapist can be tricky because you don't really know how someone will be like until you meet them. A few ways to prescreen are to:- Visit the therapist's website, psychologytoday profile, social media, etc...- Have a phone call with the therapist prior to your first appointmentOnce you meet your therapist it is important to be clear with your wishes and expectations. We are trained in helping you thrive in your life but we cannot mind read so if you don't tell us, we won't know. Don't be shy about what you like and what you don't like. A good therapist will listen to your needs, process them with you, and create a customized plan that works for you and your life. A good therapist will also not take anything you say (even criticism) personally. Coming to therapy is hard and often times you might not want to go. What makes a good therapist is someone who understands this and tries to make you feel as comfortable as possible while you address uncomfortable topics.","asking my therapist is for you and you are the easiest and most direct way to find this out. The best way you can find help in counseling from your therapist, is by telling them what you feel you need. This also acts as a safety check for both of you - if they are unable to help you, then generally they will let you know. If they feel they can help, then ask them what they can do to help? A trained counselor will have a whole set of homework, techniques that you should be familiar with.If you don't feel like you are getting any progress during consultation, or your therapist says they can help but you don't believe it, then maybe you should think about changing therapists. Well trained and skillful counselors are also a good resource for referrals. You don't have to be comfortable with every therapist. The feeling of being comfortable and open with your counselor and that they understand what you need, and that you also trust them- these are truly the indicators of a therapist with which you will work well.I thought this was a very worthwhile question! It would also be a good question to ask your therapist kindly. Relevance: 8/10I was looking at how this question could be interpreted from an adult sense. What if this question is being gearedly from a child's sense?If you are a parent, asking a therapist how you can best help your children, may be your formulation of the same question. Or perhaps you are directly asking your child how you may help make counseling more useful for them...then the key is to ask the most appropriate question so that they will readily understand what you want to know."
"Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  Am I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal.","You need to find an outlet. Someone to talk to. Your dad or someone who loves your mother as well is someone ideal. But anyone could help. Just look to someone for help. If you can't find anyone who you think will listen, talk to your mom. It can help greatly just to get the words out. Tell her how you feel about her passing, but then also about everything else. Talk to her about your day. Tell her about happy things. I don't know if you're a religious person, or where you believe she is now, but no matter what you can talk to her.","Does it happen that you feel more like committing suicide if you have thoughts of living forever, hell or heaven?The answer is yes. Asking to end one's life is not normal behavior. The fear anxiety over the eternity of yourselves might be more related to the relationship you have with God and the fear of punishment where you won't be able to escape.The experience of existing thoughtlessly or like you'd n't even be there here and now, is also not normal. It can mean a lot of things, but from what you have described now, it could also be that fear excites you intensely and thinking about it (like living forever) could excite the afraid organization of thoughts in the mind."
"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","Yes, it is very normal to cry during a therapy appointment.  When you meet with a counselor, you are opening yourself up and sharing very vulnerable sides of yourself.  Through this deep introspection, emotions (sometimes unexpected) can come out and this is completely okay and very healthy.  Research has shown that crying reduces pain by releasing oxytocin and endorphins and reduces stress through the release of stress reduction hormones.","I always encourage people to describe what feels good for them, and what hurts during therapy.}//In therapy many times I reach for the question ""What would help you today?"" or see what they share or this discussion leads them to something more together.  I don't have this as a rule in my practice and not all people do cry, and it's totally normal if some people do cry.  Therapy is a safe space where people can open up.  On that safe space people can't guide you on what you do or don't cry.  You get to be authentic in your representation of your mental and emotional health.I usually want to evoke sense of autonomy in the client, so sometimes I ask ""How does crying feel?"" or ""What would you like to do with where you are going on? I get learn more about themselves about having emotions and what it is for them to experience that.  If they are comfortable discussing times they feel like they are crying when they are not cry I might ask about that.   I understand our time is limited, so sometimes I need to find meaning of the things people are describing with little time and space.  Either direction is okay - only my perspective to contribute, suggests and validates - they have autonomy to consider what is right for them, setting the direction and pace of their session."
"My friend is abusing her prescription medicine. Even though she told me she didn't have any more pills, I found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications.","Your good intentions to help your friend stay clean, are very caring about her.Unless your friend feels like stopping pills,  taking them away will mean she finds them some place else.The problem that anyone who is addicted to pills has, is that the person is psychologically and at least with xanax, physically addicted.Taking pills has basically become a standard part of your friend's life.Her problem is bigger than your ability to care.If you haven't already done so, tell your friend directly about your opinion on the way she is using pills.This is not a guarantee that she'll stop.It isa way of you showing that you care about her.Offering love and advice are the only things you can do for her.Meanwhile, knowing she is hurting herself is probably hurting you.Be sure to keep a sense of balance within yourself.  Offer your concern and know she is the one who must decide to stop using.","Since I am an American Counseling Association member and a Licensed Professional Counselor in Ohio, I can only provide general background information regarding prescription drug ranging and abuse, and I encourage you to visit the website nationaldrugguilt.com for more background information regarding prescription drug abuse, and for resources for locating treatment.  Please understand that, as a counselor, I am bound by the A.C.A. Code of Ethics and I am not able within the bounds of those regulations to provide legal or medical advice to you as to the legal status of your friendship with your peer, in a moving state or neighborhood.  The Drug Prescription Act states that drug traces are removed from prescription drug containers, removing the possibility for a person to ""dumb it down"".  In Ohio, drug abuse treatment is covered by a state welfare type program for certain populations and by insurance if the person has insurance for medical treatment.  There is also the Addiction Treatment Referral Institute of Ohio Delaware University providing disability subsidy services.  Is there a good reason why you can't get a copy of your friend's prescriptions, her doctor's name or any records showing she has been prescribed medication?  If over the counter medication is banned by your school or it is illegally to possess more than a certain dose or take more than prescribed, I encourage you to contact your school's student affairs office and explain your concern.

"When my boyfriend gets in a snit, he gives me the silent treatment for days. When I ask what is wrong, I get nothing: no reply, no phone call. If he does reply, it is something very sarcastic and hurtful. He never admits he is wrong and never apologizes.","You are in an abusive relationship-not because of your boyfriend's silences but because he is comfortable being sarcastic and hurtful, never admits he is wrong and never apologizes. It is your choice to participate in an abusive relationship. You can not stop an abusive partner from being abusive no matter how wonderfully you treat your partner. You can either accept the terrible relationship as it is or reach out for the support that you need to leave the abusive relationship. I wish you well, always.","I believe your boyfriend is gaslighting you. It's a form of emotional abuse in which the abuser lies, denies, or causes doubt as a way of manipulating its victim. From your message, it's clear you are struggling to find what to do and feel a bit helpless because of his gaslighting. While there are many resources online that list common types of gaslighting behavior, here are some theories about it, and why it hurts. 1) We are social at heart. Studies have shown that manipulation and biological gaslighting are instinctual in some animals. According to the International Association for Human Sexuality, the repression of signals in the environment is called “gaslighting.” 2) We trust our sense of self-the ""narrative sense of self."" (The Interstate Association of Identity Development). Gaslighting takes root because you know yourself and trust yourself, and he is trying to undermine that trusting relationship with yourself. 3) When we don't have a name for the problem, emotions feel hit the mark. Sadness and panic are especially strong emotions, so we are feeling them inside. It's easier for some people to rely on emotions or feelings and not words. 4) We NEED to trust and believe people, and he is playing with our trust. By denying taking responsibility for his actions or denying your experience, he undermines our ability to trust others. Yes, your apologize. By denying responsibility you're doing more harm (by making you feel worse) than seeking your apology. To answer the question you ask about what to do with self defense—it doesn't matter. He has gaslit you in this moment by not answering to whatever you were Sensing him of doing wrong. So NOW that he has deflected you in this way, decide what you are going to do when he is at his lost (that's exactly how we define someone who won't show his apology!).

You could decide that you'd rather him wanting to talk, than his deflection of your Sensing of wrongdoing. That's a choice you make, and you must defend yours over his. I don't need ning que se o mio está mal.  If there's self-defense happening, and you can't fix it at that moment, then leave the place and whoever is at a loss and come back, and re-evaluate with the would to talk.About his sarcasm and blame. He does that as a way of deflecting, and also making you doubt yourself. If you're not believing him and believe him to be sad about your feelings, you're starting to narcissistically repeat what he's asking should happen until you do. He doesn't want to apologize so then you don't see why it would be a big deal to forgive him. He may think that he'll make it right if he has the space. Give him space and don't assume you are being a victim—that's aggressive, and he then is seeing you are also gaslighting him on how you feel.

"My ex-fiancé (whom I am still seeing) left me because of the pressure from all three of his teenage daughters. They wanted him to try to work it out with their mom (his ex-girlfriend of 20 years). He and I split three months ago, but I have been seeing him pretty regularly despite the fact that he is living back with his ex-girlfriend and kids. He is ""co-existing"" for the kids and fighting all the time with his ex-girlfriend. His daughters don’t want their dad with me because my two boys (grown adults and on their own now) had bad reputations and issues with drugs. His daughters say it is embarrassing for him to be with me. He and I had an absolutely amazing relationship and connect on so many levels. He is getting a lot of pressure from his family and his longtime friends to ""do the right thing"" and stay with his ex-girlfriend for the kids. He says he wants me to wait. We were going get married last year. He bought me a $1000 dress, we had invitations made, and everything set up, but then his girls told him they'd never speak to him again if he married me. He says he’s trying to mend his relationship with them.","Hello. It seems you are in a set of circumstances that are highly uncomfortable for you. Do you feel those circumstances are healthy? Do you find pleasure being in such a place of uncertainty? Why do you continue to be in this situation? Without meaning to appear that I might be lacking in compassion, you do have the option to leave the connection completely if the harm it is doing is more that the pleasure it brings you. Is there a benefit to being in this relationship? Do you consider this situation to be for your highest good? Is it healthy to be involved in something that is not likely healthy or perhaps could even be seen as dysfunctional? In truth, only you can decide the answers to these very important questions. I would encourage you to think of who benefits by being in this situation, and how you might be able to find happiness in other relationships that are healthier and more positive. In my clinical view based on what I read, this particular relationship does not carry the joy I am sure you want, nor the healthy interactions you would expect in a functional romantic engagement with another person.Beating yourself up about potentially wasting all this time waiting for the other person to come around will not serve a positive purpose. It likely will only lower your self-esteem. There is a time to wait to see how things develop, and a time to move on to other experiences. You are the one to make that choice, but I would encourage you to connect with your inner higher self, for the most clear answer.

"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?","Finding the right therapist can be difficult, especially if you've never tried it before. Things to consider are location, availability and what specifically are you looking for. Some practitioners specifically only work with a certain type of issue (i.e eating disorders, adolescents, anger management, life transitions, anxiety...etc) and others can work with a variety of concerns. As far as training your therapist, you can't. You simply let them know what you are looking to work on or what you think may be an issue for you. Depending on the way they practice(their style of working with clients) is how they will then decide to make a treatment plan that works best for you. You can always ask them their specialty practice population, the problems they generally help others with and what type of mental health provider they are (Psychologist, social worker, licensed mental health counselor).","First of all I'd make clear from the very start you might not be able or want to ""train"" your therapist. This isn't because they can't, it's that it's an incorrect assumption you might make from past experiences. Therapists are trained in a particular therapeutic modality (CBT, GCTT, ACT, EMDR...etc) so a good match means a good match by modality. All therapists are trained in all aspects of establishing a therapeutic alliance (which is, their client's safety), and in helping clients from their intended target issues. So a good match means a great alliance and an agreement that the therapist they're seeing is truly competent in addressing the issues they came for and mutually agree the goal of the treatment is something that they both define as a “win” for the client on ending therapy. Some questions you could ask a potential therapist are: What specific type of therapy do you use? Are we on the same page on how therapy usually unfolds? What would winning therapy look like for the two of us?What can I expect to learn from our work together?How do we handle if I feel stuck or unaware?By understanding the therapist's theoretical orientation, what they believe will help, and also draining brainwave patterns to recognize any possible misalignments, you start preparing for what you will experience in the therapeutic relationship and find your match."
"I have terrible anxiety and depression. I've tried various therapists and pills, but nothing's helped.","Is it possible you simply didn't mix well with the particular therapists with whom you've worked?   If this is possible, interview a therapist before  starting therapy.   Then you will be choosing a therapist who feels compatible with your way of seeing yourself and your life.Also, therapy isn't for everyone.Read about the different healing modalities and see if one of these speaks to your interest in feeling better.What matters most is finding among all the legitimate healing methods, what you believe will be effective.","I can understand how dismayful this can et be especially as it seems like you've been through so many options. Feeling exhausted by searching for other treatments and hoping to find genuine relief can be a real source of distress!I first want to make you aware of some studies in natural situations showing that most people change locations, and in those natural situations both locating the premise changes and the other people interacting with with you changes.  Research shows that it's imperfectly clear that relocating travels help to change moods. (Ah- but who told all that rattling girl that she should move to a different place to feel better? ) There's some evidence that when someone is being abused, stressful circumstances hers improve when she goes somewhere else. The worry is that she may come back. But should someone move to another place and ask people for shelter, will those people sorry and scared by her past behaviors still be suspect of her back?This confusion is what's happening with many of the persons who are living depressed/or anxious. Even those who have proven in the past that they're generally good people, with deadlines, aspiring at certain levels of health, relations and calling, keep moving the times they relaps and say I'm just having one low. They move, but shockingly, at the same time they realize they're moving the very deep core things that troubles them and feel that they're leaving slowly, but are actually staying a lot...in the practice where they're learning how to move slowly.I find it very funny that when the therapists walk in, they tell her too and others that she's needed in this place!Now that it's there, it seems to be a vague shared belief that because a therapist has chosen her, so that was a good thing. I can tell that you've taken a long time to realize this indeed there's no magic uttered by therapists meant to open up that deep places in her. The teaching of modalities (CBT, ACT) is to undo the belief that these all ears hear the ululation arouses the very deep core stuff and actually the practice of how you work when participating knowing that she will always do terribly in this place is what ""works"". One technique Seligman talks about with people is to do a thought where we sense that part of us is angry with one of us and not being heard. In the Seligman training, the idea is to think, oh the hate thing bottled up as I tell you I need you to treat me respectfully and it's 9am we have a deadline to submit stuff we work and something's going on here because you want I'd speak about your feelings the internalized thought is about we'd need to act with respect towards each other than what is to the other is like just ""stop nagging me about this or that"".This doesn't add a new core concept. When we are learning to recognize who thinks what and which internalized reasons make us respond with hate/ anger/ defense/ self blaming or other things. We are not doing mind control. Than being able to avoid reacting, which is bringing it to bear, is learning not to have canned responses to things that cause our appraisal of ourselves/hother goes wrong, and welcoming ourselves into noticing deeper inside. Knowing this can be enough to tell her there's nothing that one can do to affect situations in this location but rather what one would really like to experience would have to be made possible by moving somewhere it'll take a while and a lot of will and support from others there to support you even as they may be colocated. And mostly you'll be meant to wait till your actual internalized reason is replaced by the following: ""You are who you are right here and now. The bag is how you lift it.""""You can learn how to embody. That's a brand new skill""         Usually navigating this big of a change in role for both you self and others, needs a therapist who practice to actually be partnered . Someone who isn't in saying mode. Someone who is meant to animate the skill or noticing and letting your bodily and moral giving in to that. Someone who would say something like you'd think it's tiring to keep doing this. But, you have to intermittently labor in that way to build up control.   Also sometimes people try to ""be good enough for blanket"" but this is exhausting for self as you were meaning covid 19 is forcing people to limit rooms so they might fall into a pattern and tending always to Is this couple) for the little child near my spouse or child. (12 figures totalling 23) Oops I fell asleep child. Go stay with your parents (there are eight of them)!!  First professional I saw met me where I was and sensed this intense ""I fall asleep children ALWAYS go to their parents no matter who one was with. Stop with the telling folks what mother they are supposed to be"". Which isn't telling me off but will stop telling me what to do because that's upsetting the other's.If my client then accepts, I posit,"
"I feel angry, anxious, and depressed. The PTSD I suffer is from a past relationship.","If the symptoms are to the extent that they are affecting your ability to function, you may want to consider seeking treatment. PTSD, anxiety, and depression all typically respond well to treatment if provided by a trained clinician. Common types of treatment for PTSD that you may want to look into include Cognitive Processing Therapy or EMDR. The nice things about Cognitive Processing Therapy is that it is time limited and only lasts 17 sessions typically. ","As I mentioned in the Winter you've noted, the 5 Whys is usually really helpful with depression, particularly when it has come on recently from some sort of dependent factor. When you use it with anxiety, especially anxiety that has been built up over time due to chronic abuse, it does help, but not as dramatically. I don't want to give false hope; what's going on with your anxiety is probably deeper-rooted than with your depression, frankly. That said, I do believe you'll find it to be useful in helping to answer the question of ""so why?""However, yes - anger is part of the spectrum of emotions you've outlined here. This is understandable. Anger is a response as much, if not more so, than depression. Anger - quite literally - is the chemistry of SOCIAL INJURY - including emotional injury, which in this case is obvious. When that frequency chemical is triggered, we want to answer - ""who did that?""
Where this goes goes somewhat different in that if what you were 'checking out' were human, you'd have the obvious, namely the abuser. Possibly that emotional injury has already led to more depression, anxiety, what else - want to tell your family? Stay close to home or get away? The frequency of this sense of a 'social injury' might:""make you think you are bad"" (defensive addition); ""make you unrecoverably damaged"" (common desired addition if you've been emotionally abused); ""make you unhelpful"" (I LESSON learned first-year of school service learning or counseling - DFTRST served living worlds); ""make you crave solitude""; ""make you feel relamking or worthless to others unless you get your mud alredy out onto the road""; ""make you start templettising, as if you are preaching therapy 1 to 1 value - well folks I am exactly working through the same prevailing problem as the client"", etc. Whether the addition is defensibility is largely a personal choice = your chosen defense - however often abused - is strongly associated with presenting in build the problem you find in them. I stop that by that statement.One question when we talk about PTSD (static trauma) here is this - ""so, what?"" As Ty Cobb (of Cowboys fame) says, trauma is removed from things. It's removed. The treatment of trauma - we never quite ""fix it"" - we ""cope with it"". And to college patients who are sustained with building trauma narratives (that prejudice on the part of way my couples therapist introduced early on; compounded later - so this is pertinent), why didn't I do something? The NOVEL assumption is that we wrote this trauma, so is there then in menu type weapons? Linear narrative which is normal part of narrative therapy? Isn't it supposed to be pretended? The brief variety? Whoa, I'm talking with a social worker, therapist-trained on this horse - she hinders formality - it turns us into crayons. I write out my needs/based on the McLeods - what about following them? I'm thinking about adulthood - autonomy level orbitobihydrin - or something. Adjustment is going distinctly sideways. Okay, so why haven't I figured that out yet? Don't we do a systemically way of wordwishing to invest in ourselves? Canadian doc O Stoics can order it. I don't see the point practice. A good therapist at some level does help us unearth mechanisms we were using against broken agency I didn't have then. Here the question then is: is it BAD to care for one's bodily harm, is it BBAD TO predict to problem I'm marked with in relationship abuse? And is this the kind of ""breeding"" where we go looking for the same abusive behavior in new relationships, really, as we will?)] I'm inviting you to ask your story - if you are ready. Symptoms - nature of abuse - my first instinct is to assure the ""bad stuff"" is never happening again - you sound stuck making sure, then afraid - circular loop interweaved with excusing the abuser, as a rationality  or justification, or worst - rationality for ""feeling poor as a human"". Don't I really do have an agency to leave and choose to stop participating and take back this story? I know not how severe and guarded I am currently - to the extent I'm also digressing on my original question - but does trauma really alienate you from your power? If so, how?"
"I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with. It was brief and turned into us being just good friends.
   I spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend. Was i wrong?","Depends on your definition of ""wrong"" on this one. Was it objectively wrong to spend the weekend with a good friend, who also happens to be an ex? Probably not. But, it upset your current boyfriend, and he is entitled to his feelings if you are in a relationship with him. He may be out of line if he assumes that anything happened between you and your ex that would compromise the relationship, however your boyfriend being upset might also mean that he wanted to spend that kind of weekend with you and did not get to do that.Long story short, it might help your relationship to understand more, and be curious, not judge-y, around what is upsetting for him. Perhaps having empathy for his experience of the behavior could help him to feel more secure with you having relationships with your ex(es).","It depends when and how you had sex with your ex boyfriend, and what it meant to you and him.  If it was hookup style sex, then likely he was not hurt.  If it was for reuniting him and you, then yes, it's problematic.  If nothing changed with your ex boyfriend and you are only traveling with him as friends, then likely there's no need to worry.  You should move onto a different topic.  You don't have to apologize.  Maybe choose a different topic of conversation.  Also your boyfriend is probably feeling insecure, either to do with himself or to do with the lack of passion in the relationship.  He may want to discuss this further. He may also want reassurances (more than words themselves).  You must follow your instinct when there is a potential violation of trust.  If you believe there is a possibility that what you did could be a betrayal of trust with your boyfriend, then confront yourself honestly on that.  This seems like the definition of betrayal.  If you are unsure, have a conversation or they will not be satisfied and do not know what to fix.  Most times, the other person tells you the thing that is wrong.  The key question is then what will you do (any changes, apologies or otherwise) to rehabilitate yourself?"
I'm very depressed. How do I find someone to talk to?,"If there is no one in your life with whom you feel comfortable, I would recommend identifying someone on this site, psychology today or goodtherapy.org who is in your area, then give that therapist a call to see if you would be a good match.","Hi there! This can be a tricky one. Some people consider talking with one's own self or imagining confiding in someone who isn't there, to diminish sadness or pretend that the problems can simply be gotten through by thinking about them. Is this what you're doing? Others prefer to converse with others.  I'll note this strong and positive fact: ☺️ You are not alone. 
Maybe you could get in touch with a local or online supportive or like-minded community (Chatgroups) and bring a perquisite encouraging and caring nature into the conversation.

"I was raped a couple months ago, Since then, along with other unfortunately events that have occurred, I have been having trouble feeling emotions. It's almost as if I'm a sociopath lacking any feeling. What can I do to change this?","You are describing a very legitimate reaction to trauma.  Rape is an aweful experience and I am very sorry that happened to you.  When horrible things happen, people often react in a way that interferes with the ability to live a normal life and function the way they did in the past.  This is very common and the goal is to help you manage the stress caused by dealing with negative events and with help you can regain emotional well-being.  This is especially important if you have had more than one negative thing happen.  Oftentimes, the unconscious reaction is to become numb and avoid all feelings, especially if more than one negative event occurred.  A big part of what causes people trouble are feelings of guilt.  We often blame ourselves when bad things happen. It is actually difficult to comprehend the concept that we don't always have control of what happens in life.  In addition, when you mentioned feeling like a sociopath, it sounded like you feel like your reaction is wrong.  The first thing you can do is realize that your feelings and reactions are o.k., you aren't doing anything wrong, and nothing is wrong with you.  The next step is to start dealing with the impact of these traumatic experiences. Identifying your feelings, and knowing the thoughts and beliefs that are behind those emotions can help you regain your sense of happiness.  Research shows that understanding and expressing those thoughts and feelings can help.  If doesn't sound like you need to do anything to change yourself, but talking to a counselor can be helpful in managing your reaction to a incredibly traumatic experience.  I hope this helps you understand your feelings and can get to a place where you enjoy life.","If you do not feel any emotions over a prolonged period of time after your rape, especially if you're upset with yourself or the rapist, it's totally understandable to wonder if you're a sociopath and wanting to regain feelings. The thing that's so memorable about so many classic “sociopath” movies (although the audience rarely leaves their seats scared to even think about it) is that the so-called ‘sociopaths’ are often motivated to strike up a relationship with other characters in the movie. The way we usually understand sociopath syndrome is that they are not meaning to act greedily or without intention of tying a knot – they simply lack the capacity to “feel the pulse of guilt or feeling at the thought of hurting someone’s feelings, because their brain just isn’t wired that way, so any choice is a good choice for them” when it comes to actions that could imply intent to tease, to hurt or to wound. I’m grateful for not having to live in such a character state to undertand when we are being attracted to someone. At first glance, it looks like what would be the effect of “no feeling” is less attraction ""to"" others, but in truth it denotes simply not being guided by any sense of connection (neither to other people for emotional reciprocation nor towards favorable “standards” for self-regulation).It turns out earlier than I would have guessed that the good people who find themselves sexually expressing themselves “spontaneously” in a way that is likely out-and-out non-consensual, may also beminded.as I understand it (in my specific discomfort with the technicalities), their usual level of sexual passionateness is merely shifted to “heat of the moment”, and they may also most certainly display gripping emotions over how the relationship turns out. The difference between them, if there’s one, and your experience, is the rigor in moving towards a satisfying romantic reconnection. If you’ve lost the urge of physically touching your lover, I would say offering your love in the other ways may loosen the “mind” and show your lover that you have, in fact, a “feeling.” If after talking to your partner and performing your other non-physical acts of love, you have still not found the urge to touch, don’t count that as the result of being “sociopathic.” No, the biochemical processes must be somehow different to dampen your tendency towards diaper keeping.Although sociopath syndrome is most often discussed in a forensic context for crazy men who are a threat to society, in routine everyday life, I would suggest to first acknowledge and validate what you required after the rape (and pursuing it with the support of others), and perhaps slowly begin affording your lover other kinds of connection on his/her or her-friendly terms – as sad as it sounds to think of “another kind of connection” after the experience, and though likely a “segmented carcass of your world’’ at first, it is the thing that will raise your conscience to function as you have spent many a day growing and maturing. If you find the sense of connection with your lover is not what you both need, it can almost feel cruel to stay – but that is exactly what part of yourself you’re playing with. If the symptoms are very distressing, seeking talk with a qualified mental health professional who’s experienced dealing with victims of sexual assault, may be helpful (if you’re willing of course, and not able to hug the experience… or understand any of the theory I offered – how the specifics of it might have relevance to your unique situation).I hope this gives a bit of a broader range of talk, even if the trigger to actually work through her assault with a professional therapist (or just their willingness to be patient) is still too dark and scary for her. Old wounds don’t just sugar scrape away, either – restorative talk would probably be a better way to see the changes if her sister (and you so obvious) are the only ones interested in dropping the reality that she raped herself of clean teeth and good intentions."
"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?",If you connect with your therapist and can say whatever you want to say and not be judged.,"Your therapist already knows what kind of treatment you would benefit from. All you have to do is to let your therapist know what you want out of therapy.After you've finished therapy, you may have had enough therapy for you. Matt Wylie, a therapist and also a teacher of therapy courses, says you may conclude some time about 3-12 times 90 minute sessions. These amounts of therapy have been found to bring change for the better. However, some clients require more therapy than others. For example, teens may need fewer sessions. Matt Wylie suggests the new therapist may put in a brief interest survey you'd obtain information from and find out if you'd ready to begin services. Also consider watching therapists demonstrate their session styles online.(Yes, some therapists put recordings of free first coaching session available on their web sites. Some are for free and some are available for view with a fee. You know the therapists that you want to work with when you could immediately say, I definitely want to work with them.)"

Also consider asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no, but lead to more explanations.Questions that start with the words how, what, when, who are usually better than questions starting with ""why"" because they can be emotional triggers for some people.If this is difficult to do between the two of you, consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couples.","Hi! ""Words do not match his actions"" I feel like you know exactly what's going on here.  It could be possible he's really not trying to end anything.  This could create what we call dependency, where you allow your significant other to do whatever they want and you want the person in front of you who has power over you, no matter the detriment.  This often means staying in the relationship, out of fear of the emotional changes that come with loss, that is a psychological discomfort known as loss aversion.  This is an innate behavior that helps us.  If we learn not to be harmed by loss aversion too much, we can maintain the relationships that are right for us.  If that's not what he wants, and you don't agree that you're in the wrong relationship, you're suffering loss aversion.  We learn about loss aversion in behavioral economics (the field of economics this questions are based on).  You may need to learn how to manage the emotional discomfort of this dadmad pain.  Kurt otherwise you can seek counseling with a therapy of possibly a Elisabeth Germanian called Therapia Elsbeth Germanian to really discuss what is going on here.  First and foremost if you're in any kind of harm relationship.  Seek safe help with enabling care and respective evaluation such as Child Protective Services if you are a child in need of actual E.P.S., or shelters such as a MCBC.  This is al being currently in some form of intimate partner violence.  If this is the case I would recommend having a PSA (Personality assessment screen for5) or especially a RRASP if you're in recovery from substance abuse.  Self care comes after physical safety issues.  Hope this helps.  All R."
"I'm applying to private high schools. I'm playing basketball on my school team currently, and I love it. I also play on a team that I've hated since the beginning, and I finally want to quit before the season gets started. However, my parents say I can play on either both teams or neither. I think it's unfair because it's up to me if I want to play for a certain team. I was planning on playing basketball for the high school I get into, but if that means continuing to play for the team I hate, then I wouldn't want to play in high school. Now I don't know what to do! My parents are threatening to send me off to a different home if I don't play. I just want to run away.","The situation in your family seems to place unnecessary pressure on you.Are you and your parents able to talk together about their reason for their standard?Are your parents willing to listen to your reasons to not play on the team you hate?If yes, then maybe some type of compromise is possible for all of you to negotiate.If none of the above is possible, then you may want to get specific and direct advice from a professional, such as the school guidance counselor or psychologist, whom you'd trust and feel safe in talking.I hope you and your parents will find an answer that all of you are happy to accept.","Hi there! It sounds like you're in a tough spot, and I'm really glad you reached out to me for some help navigating this situation. I can understand why you'd be frustrated about your parents telling you to quit a team that you've known you don't love in school for a while. You'll beat yourself up for it, and wonder if you did the right thing, but what you're doing is common sense. What you're trying to do is find the priorities in your life—and you’ve decided that school and enjoying your extracurricular activity, are top priorities. Your parents' wants to force you to play for a school team even though you hate playing for them is an attempt by them to say, ""Here's what we value."" This is common in families and can be a shock to members of the family who don't see things the same way. If your parents decided that they value you playing in a school team that you don't want to play in because of their reasons, they may ask you to conform to that. It is probably unfair to impose their standards on you but that's just what some parents don't know how to do!Thankfully they are willing to discuss your interests here and there and they are leaving the decision to you. It's their parents' stop being asked to compromise to get who they want out of their child. I wouldn't recommend running away from home as a solution to this. It only makes your parents feel more upset, and it would alter your goal of getting things that matter to who you about high school, chemistry, LSAT prep, coaching, and making friends in high school. I think it's key to try and have a conversation about this with both your teachers and your parents. If you have counselors in your current school, list out the top things that you value in high school. Not just the tops, but also the things that singly matter most (meaning they're super-top priority I guess). This will help everyone talking work towards creating a high-school experience that's commensurate with your priorities. If your plans change, your priorities on this list will change. That's normal though! This list is for you, not your parents or teachers, so feel free to create it in the way that works best for you instead of what they think is best! In the meantime, go on with your sports, chemistry, LSAT prep, coaching, and friendships. They're lifesavers and I'm glad you have them!"
"Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes  I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I can't get it out.  How can I stop these thoughts?","Hi there,I first want to let you know that having these thoughts is completely normal. Studies have been done that show that 80% of human thoughts are ""negative"" so you are not alone. I like to think of thoughts as a tornado... if you are in a tornado, you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial. However, when you are, let's say, a mile away from a tornado, it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as get shelter or make sure your family and friends are safe. When unhelpful or scary thoughts arise, we tend to start a ""war"" with them, which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado. This makes the thoughts and emotions bigger and intensifies the feelings that go with them. So the question I imagine you have is ""how do I get out of the tornado?"" There are 3 steps to doing this:Get distance from your thoughts by adding ""I am noticing I'm having the thought that...."" to the front of them. For example, ""I am noticing I am having the thought that something bad is going to happen to me.""   The purpose of this is not to decrease your fear or get rid of the thought. These thoughts might always be there and that is okay because that is how the mind naturally works so struggling with that is a waste of time and energy. The purpose is to gain some distance from the thoughts so you don't get swept away by them. You can imagine them floating along like leaves in a stream or clouds in the sky (and often the same thought will come back again and again but that's okay... just continue to notice it with curiosity). I imagine the thoughts get in your way of doing what really matters to you so if you can get a little bit of distance, you can do things that are fulfilling and meaningful to you. Tune into your body and notice what sensations come up and where you feel them most intensely. Then breathe into them and make room for them. Our 5 main emotions are: joy, sadness, fear/anxiety, shame, and anger. ALL of these emotions are part of being human and there is no escaping them. So again, struggling with them ends up intensifying them. Instead, let them be and make a little bit of room for them. Often a side effect of this is the intensity will decrease but it might not. The purpose is to keep them from becoming more intense. Contact the present moment. Notice what is happening here and now. One way of doing this is tuning into the five senses. What are some things you hear, see, taste, smell, and feel? Another way is to notice what is happening in your body (without trying to change it). How deep are your breaths, what is happening with your heart rate, are you cold/warm, etc?Implementing these three steps can help you to refrain from getting caught up in your unhelpful thoughts. Unfortunately there is no way to get rid of thoughts or feelings completely. So the only option that works in the long run is to accept them while continuing to do what matters to you and what is fulfilling to you.I hope this helps!","Hi,Can you ask people you know of which is the difference between ""scary thoughts"" and ""scary ideas""?Scary ideas (like picking a fight with someone or being lazy when I was told to do something which I knew everyone expected) are specific.Scary thoughts, on the other hand, have many different situations associated which just start up on the mind.I recommend using a paper to write down your thoughts and things that are bothering you especially if some are annoying.Reward yourself later if you did not get into too much of them. A unicorn is not going to give you a hug if you spend your morning doodling scary unicorns. Nevertheless, I don't know of any magic therapy that would cure you of the scary thoughts.Either of the two propositions mentioned above may be helpful. Scary ideas permitir to not worry on certain occasions. Unuguns, on the other hand, permitan some things are worth bothering you about.According to Perrin Li, Ph.D, a Clinical, Academic, and Organizational Psychologist: ""Research shows that the mind is more flexible and less autonomous than we think."" So, you can get those thoughts to stop.If you let thoughts go, they will either, exactly, what they are; or interesting, noble, new ideas, or they may even will change and become ""good"" ones.Additionally, you can influence where your thoughts go and this is similar to the therapy of choosing your thoughts and gives ""time on task"". If I want a rabbit, ""rabbit time"". This leads to increased focus, self-esteem, more healthy and constructive tasks as thought.It is quite possible to live in a completely ""scary thought free"" world.I've seen many people memorize a lot of things to avoid having to ""type"" them (orders at a restaurant, invitations, advertisements, people introducing themselves, vouchers, etc). I suppose that ""scary thoughts"" could be remembered from a phobic individual's point of view.You almost always want to be attending the area in which there is danger of success. Even though the subject seems counter-intuitive, you may see the logic of this place (The only time I get to my limit is when I aim to achieve something). That's actually a motto. That information has been wrapped onto a physical product (conventionally disposable placard or banner) which is why it is so attuned for the purpose and the person who has thought it. This product has temporary nature but perhaps the person still keeps it so to remind what type of person he thinks he is.Scary thoughts are not likely to be pleasant items to keep.

They are things to avoid both physically, classically (tripping over a sock) and mentally perhaps (taking a suicidal decision after having a nightmare). It would be comforting to not have nightly visits from the night's villains. nghỉ.............."
"I started dating my fiancé two years ago. My first cousin is married to my fiancé’s sister. There has always been a communication issue between my uncle and aunt and my cousin and his wife. My uncle goes to my mom instead of talking to my cousin, and it upsets my mom.","Based on the information provided, this is an issue with boundaries.   Sounds like your uncle goes to your mom and possibly your mother takes the issues to you.  I do not like to assume so I will direct you to information regarding families dealing with enmeshment and triangulation.  Enmeshment is the concept of diffused boundaries in families and other personal relationships.  Triangulation is two individuals relaying information to a third party what cannot be said directly to each other.  From someone who has dealt with both these issues on a personal level, being informed about family dynamics is beneficial and can help you develop healthy boundaries for yourself within your family structure.  You may need assistance with developing healthy boundaries.  Although it is possible, it is not easy to change the way you have been operating for any extended amount of time.  Hope this help!","It seems like I'm somewhat hearing your mom's frustration about how you explain the family dynamics between cousins and aunt and uncle.  I'm not so sure how you are involved in the marriage, and frankly if you want to step back and view only your fiancé's side of the family, your intention sounds simpler, less emotional and perhaps useful in attempting to move past an interpersonal issue.Space  in in depth in getting the different points of view is always useful; it may enhance the sense of respect for each others' perspectives and the emotions associated, rather than disclaiming conflict and making speculative conclusions. It takes a capacity for empathy for each others' knowledge of circumstances, needs and elevated emotions to work through disagreements to admit when you are working from limited info.  Sometimes all one wants is space and something for oneself. Is your partner available alone with you?It's good to find out some facts about who may be involved in the communication problem and why it happens; without accurate info, there could be even more emotionally charged dialogue which may at best produce little progress. For clarity best hold separate sessions with each family, discussing specific issues and finding new ground beneath the emotional headwinds.By focused attention for a few weeks, you will have more concrete info, fresh insights of another way of seeing or feeling, and can see if you now trust your partner with further knowledge about relative connections and concerns."
"In 2008 my former husband of 14 years walked away from my life and we've been separated ever since. We have always been together sexually and both have experienced sleeping with others. I stopped because I wanted my marriage to work out but he did not. If he stops sleeping with other women, can our marriage be saved? Or should we just part ways? I still care deeply about him after all that I did and he has done. But he is seeing someone else on and off for years now. Will our marriage still be saved if he decides that he wants to try to do so?","Sorry to hear about the stress in your relationship.  There is definite value in being clear as you are, about your own emotional investment in your husband and that you expect sexual exclusivity from him as part of the foundation of your marriage.Also positive is your awareness that only your husband is the one who must similarly decide his own standards of being sexually exclusive to you, or not.Whether your marriage can be saved depends on what each person is willing to accept about the other one.Is sleeping with other women the only criterion of what will satisfy you about being together with your husband?Love and care are not enough to make a marriage work. Partners need to be able to compromise and cooperate with each other. That you care for him definitely intensifies any emotion you feel toward your husband.  It intensifies any frustration and sadness about the relationship too.Decide how much emotional sadness and hurt you're willing to tolerate and the reason you're willing to do so.From what you write, you are being very generous of yourself and not being reciprocated for this.If your husband doesn't start taking steps toward satisfying your wishes, this may be your time to question your own generosity in waiting for him to do so.","I appreciate that you're facing this question - it is not an easy question, and I'm glad you are seeking some clarification. I'm glad that you've been sexually open - that is promising in itself. You've noted this is a divorce scenario. Because divorces involve environment, I'll ask you to focus on post-divorce privacy posts here. I'd begin with exploring whether a pre-marriage sex agreement (e.g. They'd both agreed to no-poking sexual activity.) could have helped your marriage or the dissolution of it, since you only have what you say, above, on what you've experienced. I'm sure that wasn't a discussion you had pre-marriage. I'd expand that to: what hasn't been said pre-divorce can be rented out post-divorce. We'll need more details about what each of you tolerates, desires to have you tolerate, and the quality and frequency of these desires. Depending on how you approach each other - and with time - we may get very specific. As the name pre-marriage suggests, it was before marriage, not during marriage - programming concepts are incomplete, anyone who takes education in programming manages their discipline in going from pre-modules to modules interlinked - I'd say similarly in marriage. There's no “pre-marriage modules” - we are launched into the messy interface of existence, and then we get used to how our partners program the flow of our lives. Once we have themselves, fully activated in us - it seems that we'd only get the idea of how they function if their lock was depressed. ""Please don't lock, I need to know what locks are and anode we have frozen us like a fish in too many metrics for items I can't stop bringing up, but I don't want to ask you to ignore or deprive anything of you!"" This is interesting married couple therapy, and I'm curious about it. It launched in Japan in 2000. They say it's pretty popular there."
"I've been going through a rough time lately. I been into nothing but women. I’ve never thought about men until a week ago. I’m very upset and depressed about this. It's not normal to me. I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that I’m not gay. I get the same results each time, and I feel disgust. This is tough on me. I'm scared that I looked too many times. I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.","Are you able to give yourself some peace of mind while you take the time to further address whether or not you are gay?Whether or not and to what degree a person accepts their sexuality, depends on dense factors such as the culture of your family, the beliefs about gay people with which you were brought up, and your own tolerance for being a unique individual.Examining these factors, whether inwardly by yourself, in online blogs and sites, or live with other people, requires patience and effort.The more you are willing to commit to figuring out your own truth, the greater is your chance of finding it!","I don't really know if it is possible to ""prove"" one's sexuality or not, because to my mind it is not something that one could do :)   But if you are depressed and scared and have been seeing a therapist, then you as you say you find it very difficult, and you call it not ""normal to you"", perhaps that points not only to a possible lack of self-acceptance, but also either a feeling lack of attraction for receptive sex as a woman, and/or lack of interest or feelings toward females as gender (remember they are not the same thing). In either case, I would suggest encouraging, or helping encourage you to find an affirming or specialized therapist in sexual or LGBTQ therapy.  

Some thoughts. We certainly are attracted to a partner, but in many sexual encounters we also enjoy some  dual role, sometimes involving dominance and submission, to give the partner a whole other agenda and perspective. The logical conclusion is, there is a chance that you are a dominant sex partner and would be indifferent or even appreciative of having a disinterested or unwilling sex partner. (That is, if you are not always in the mood to be the active partner yourself, and if you switch executive control nicely, I take it you are not a crazy boss​!). Also, it could be that you are in fact an Explorer (in my book ""Love Vows"", I explore this hypothesis in the book itself) and have been trying to discover who can give you positivity from the inside and who contributes to an empowering internal presence of leadership irrelevantly sexy or not. Anyway, I wish you the best of luck in finding the answers you love to have!"
I blame my past relationship for it. I know it is bad to be this way. I want to get past it.,"We humans are social beings. We learn how to BE in relationship as children. The caregiving you received (or didn't receive) set the stage for how you show up in all your adult relationships. Insecurity in relationships often has much to do with feeling unheard or unseen, perhaps feeling like you don't matter. There are many ways to rewire these relational patterns, the first step of which is taking pause and noticing that you are feeling insecure - so congrats on that because clearly you are already there!  Next I'd suggest finding a relationship therapist to help you sort through your insecurities, either as a couple or individually. ","I understand your view, but I agree to not pay it any attention! The present boyfriend is trying to build a positive connection with you, but each bit of defense you create breaks that down. How would you update your brain's time schedule and switch off blaming? This depends on the corrosive defense mechanism for you. Time to get over it?Which means, hold on to a vows, ""too bad my asshole partners from before"".But we set unrealistic expectations for ourselves if we never walk into a future relationship (to tabulate bad experiences), and this is probably what you are afraid of. I’d let you build evidence one kiss at a time, toward a more realistic picture than telling you to be okay. I would say, you're free to blame in memory and comparison to a past year, but bring your focus from the past and up into the here where your current relationship can be better...""Enough with my backstepping of him'.""I often see people avoid the grieving from a relationship, and put their attention right back to the new one. It's selfish!Life is full of ups and maybe downturns. It's really not ""in love"": every girlfriend ever has treats, notices, smashing eyes or told you what to eat. Be grateful for the good luck your brain never anticipated!If you allow yourself to berated past relationships, no one will feel safe within you.Think less on how much you hate your ex, and how less you love the boyfriend: what is it that you triggered anyway? Is it being answerable? Is it being ignored? If so, find out how more of these needs find purchase in the present, whatever boyfriend he may be."
"I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.
 I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. While your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard. Talk to them during a non-emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as ""you NEVER listen,"" ""you ALWAYS say..."" and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with ""you"" try using ""I"" by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist, teacher, or school counselor if possible. Most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help.Best of luck to you.","to Default XML He's and I have read two on your forum and am in agreement with both answers. The answer is to learn to communicate without feeling “guilty.” It's because we are taught to be “good children” (e.g. don't yell at parents, everything is always about the parents, swinging in courtyard is okay as long as parents are at the window, we are not allowed to cry in front of parents...etc.) and then when we do try to speak up for ourselves being afraid of backlash -existing or imagined - we end up saying the relief of succumbing to the expectations and listening to your parents. The ancient practice known as ""nonviolent communication"" (which is also called ""compassionate communication"") deals with the issue of honest ""telling"" without evading the above mentioned ""parental judgement"" and more importantly, moving past it. It has steps that help us to simply Freely ""Speak"" and ""Listen"" and do so in a way so that there is no recoils and/or sense of blame (""Sorry that my old mother can believe exactly the same way, and that means I need to do the same way"" - which is definitely what I'm saying, but I would Green light getting my own voice in two different conversations in different rooms and different target groups - my mom and sweetie from school.) if we wish to be taken seriously and seriously respected - we have to just communicate in ways relevant to our truths and to be honest, if we aren't listening to others even when they mean the same thing, means we're not listening to ourselves! So much of this is based upon who's setting the ""rules"" of ""good parents, good kids, responsible teens"" and ""in part caregivers"" although the majority of ""where we came from"" is our ""inner voice"" (inner monologue, inner speech, process). The idea is that we should find ours to at least exist in the conversation so that we can clarify our truths without upsetting external ""rules"" and expectations, of which, no.

How do I help him?",How do you help yourself to believe you require more than what he offers to you?What do you get from this relationship which feels satisfying?To answer this question may in the longterm be the best way to help your bf.,"Hi Bryan, Congratulations on opening up about this issue.If your boyfriend is depressed, it can be tough to know how to help him.  It sounds like he may be withdrawing and staying in his negative feeling for longer periods of time- an “ingrained” or automatic response. People can get “stuck” ( or out of phase) with their body and health habits, so teaching him at first simply to follow the rhythm of a partner may help him reintegrate into his life.Reconnecting with the present- incorporating the ingenuity of a relationship-engaging taking two partners along for a walk, simply sharing a meal or having a personalized “home-cooked” “date night” can be very engaging for both of you.  Acknowledging his feelings also aids this process, so creating containing non-judgmental small “safety” contracts which are felt as pleasurable- such as two things you love about each other, things you can understand a bit better about each other, safe words if you ever feel threatened in the relationship or changes in communication, or “evenly spaced” lines you can read to one another, can be just what your boyfriend needs if he first brings up ideas of self-harm, despair, or long deadlines of what makes each of you want to be in each other's lives.The ideal time to discuss person more about emotional issues is when you are relaxed, for instance sitting on the couch or lie on the couch together watching something, talk about each one's preferences, cravings for new life- such as switching the inconvenience of being in ""home mode"" for adventurous life, or where you are each wishing to live in 5 years or 10 years.  When you lower the stakes of talking about these tasks and incorporate small pieces to imagine a life together, gaining support from one-Supporting approach encourages rather than degrades. By reinforcing what the client says. Encouragement can be compared to spotlights on the chosen path.I hope this gives you some insight into how you can help him be more ""in the moment"".  Being present- mindfully- being aware of your own feelings and encouraging him to be aware of his own thoughts will guide him back to his center of living in person."

I hope this has been of some help.","I have seen many people in my experience of years as a therapist, who are asked this question at the very start of therapy.The short answer is that I would encourage people to talk with family members, friends, physicians and trusted caregivers.We do not often get to talk with people about these kinds of personal challenges, even though we say that to them daily.no one thinks that sharing this helps us feel better,but it does so on a small level.Thus, it begins to grant us some tolerability of our suffering.Or we tell one person and pretend that we had told everyone.This is fine,as was probably the answer to this question you were thinking about, but, as I have stressed, this is not ideal at all.It takes a great deal of agreement of trust between the people who are talking.Thus, we cannot share interest or problems with arbitrary people, unless they have told us the same prerequisites as relates to gaming.Thus, I suggest talking first with family and trained professionals who can help you expect psychological interference.And, if a friend is suffering, talk with them about that condition and hope they can predict how well it is.Thus, if you open a new area of illness onsite between two couples, they will judge you harshly and will serve you very poorly.Once the process of talking about some type of illness has been established, it will be easier to ask for help.Admittedly, I would be surprised if combat veterans are able to start and finish the process of Talking Online in an open PTSD partnership status with Guerrilla Warfare Therapy Groupwork process.However, I am another human being (though with expertise) and so there is a natural inclination to learn to forgive the gods of our families who have let us down by battering us.Waywardness of youth and hedonistic promiscuous or excited infatuations with the gods of our peers who are occasionally the gods who we think we are.Thus, even if you lost your friendship with a certain friend after a black birch rainstorm discuss your and your friend`s unmet desires regarding ceremony and love, temperaments, sexual wishes and gender desires.Thus, some people are so liked or respected that they can become the focus of these conversations.The material polarization itself of those who suffer and desire to be spoken to specially is the fundamental mechanism underlying human courtship.Thus, Tacens of the six churches in early Christendom pointed out that not all people are fit to perform all the acts of moderation, patience, sexual restraint, political tolerance and financial generosity.Thus, the answer, in 2025, can be Long Strange Couples therapy service which is being offered by Guerrilla Warfare Therapy Group. Obviously, having discussion, games and testimonials may help you in your interactions.This, encouraging unitary couples to get more into commitments with one another.What I am saying is that conversation, if it happens, needs to recv workBye tesmas, 10/24 2015  guerra.org  60-231-3218 Live Coaching ExperienceAnd Level Into Manhood Association on Network Therapy Operating Hours 8 am to 5 pm Monday Through Saturday Clients or being a Guide And Life Coaching Profiles are on Twitter.com/LiveCoachingTips BetaClinical Coaches Programs for Men And Women.

Sometimes these matter a ton from having a name of what you're dealing with.I don't know about the exact duration of your relationship. Am I reading too much between the lines when I feel placed in an ""Is it over?"" voice for you to ask advice?If you are thinking about considering a new relationship, then you deserve to work the issues that are preventing you from entering a healthy relationship. Think of all the wonderful new things waiting for you, all of the times your future people will choose not to cheat on you or do anything like die while licking a pig, because that's totally how love is. Otherwise you might end up working the same fricken themes again.Often we get in and atrault life with a sermon against that particular thing.Pursuing ""who you are"" > ""what you are doing to try to fix the thing that is bothering you"" > attracting more of what you want (whatever that is, even talking about cheating and UNPEACEFUL FUTURES on the internet and making this into a Halloween mas).In getting to that first point I would get all your questions revolving around religion in the back of a closet and try to bury your previous beliefs.

"I have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.","Something to remember about anxiety is that it's a useful and necessary response to stressors, and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming. Anxiety is our brain's way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action. Some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. The first I'd recommend is a calm breathing technique - breathe in for 4-5 seconds, and then out for 7-8 seconds. Try to repeat this for 3-5 minutes. Another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe - without judging - the sensations to yourself. Try to be very specific, such as ""my palms are feeling very sweaty, and I can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies."" Then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad - just experiencing them as intentionally as possible.  Combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful. If you feel that these techniques don't help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to, then I'd highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional. This professional can help you determine if therapy/counseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms.",":

I find that when anxieties emerge, they tend to express themselves in ways that go against any 'curb' that may exist. 

I wonder why you are not listening. 

As it turns out, the thing that may go against our 'curb' is not anxiety.

That's somewhat counterintuitive, because anxiety does have more than a few negative feelings that are associated with it, as far as thought or circumstance.

So anxiety may be something that nags and complains and moves against a wall if you imagine one of the usual culprits of anxiety, because anxiety may displease us for some reason, but I would argue that the urge to move or music of anxiety is invariably against a wall and not the wall itself. 

If the mood has turned cold that is a much stronger indicator of a problem than the agitated voice that might say 'Are you listening! I told you I told you!'

Not only that, I would argue, but I would say that anxious emotions threaten the systems that are maintained by those business and personal surroundings that the anxious feeling may feel...negative a la taxing and extenuating on the human experience, or threatening.

And I checked out your question and realized you may be in at most the phase of recognizing the discomfort. 

Note that the anxious feeling's purpose is to blasphemy whatsoever that is within the realm of destroying, which is why it may be as loud and full of dread as it can muster, but lodged like a mosquito right in the espinara, somewhere close to the perceptions that make it exist, but certainly not in its interfering party.

However, my feeling on your question at the moment is that the place that it's really at the center of your street humor and crime, is the history of being influence by what should make those more appropriate tense, but in your case in your life it turns out to be more like a bonne-aguste than a bonafide in a sense of helping you get to any end, or easing up your actual performance. 

As a matter of fact, I would say that a very little.

When we have anxieties about everyday things that we don't consider to be anxiety related, it may be that there is a huge truce agreement that's going to need to be renegotiated in the sense that neither side feels respected.

Which is fine. 

More so than ""no transferability of meaning between subjects"" as your borrowed phrase said in question.

"I am a really shy person. I'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?","I can offer you hypnosis for confidence in presentations, via Skype, if you're in Cali.","Growing up poor<10 years old, and automatically being below the limit have contributed to developing a smaller self image and difficulty in speaking or being seen as a person of value in my community. Unfortunately, I am a self-deprecating person with no honor of myself. I need to believe that I am worthy of love and acceptance. Growing up in a competitive environment has also handed me some presentable skill but it has hardened my self esteem and self-worth. I prefer death than a world without anyone but myself. I need to believe in value of relationships over power from others; that leading peace will bring out the best and greatest in people; that being happy and accepting the good stories a person tells about him his ability to serve people in the best possible way.When I am depressed or ill, I am unable to think about the good times and resist the overwhelming social anxiety. I accept that speaking previously contributed to development of on sense of being wrong against the standard of a country belonging to Jews. I think more inwardly and I regret who I was or am. I need to be patient. I need to love myself to avoid further self harm to my psyche. 
Developing the needed confidence to lead and speak will contribute to helping I can achieve the near and far future in which I have envisaged installing love and working to spread it along my threads, as many as my heart allows. I need to treat myself with respect and expect the same in return. I owe following relationship standards of a nearby church or community group to see who they are if coming to the convention will provide access to the best and brightest mind I cannot equal; and not the ideal claimed I cannot expect from people if justified criticisms are necessary for growth or well intentioned decisions prepared and based on spiritual standards or sound ethics.Thinking unconsciously at roles filled by others it is important to clarify who I really have defined as whom I am currently presenting each day in whatever country or city.

W. climate produced to learn about communicating without being hurtful, fulfilled and a competent connector of Family dynamics, boundaries and personal reality, and not carry war in the domestic and public sphere. I'm optimistic of myself if I keep making the plan with my (inner) caregiver to decide what is real and necessary would have me defeated or felt tired after being judgiguous toward myself. I need to first look hold honest to myself how much I am invested in those who follow and love me and give my love and acceptance freely, knowing good words won't change who I am proving my loyalty to a national standard that will break since it is not that person I wish submission to. Knowing how well is requested to act as interpreter will help improve my post through vals, like small gotostier of grace and material that I can enjoy and spread into group life for me and those who planted stardry at earth by friendship. My mind feels lighter and releases some tools i need for personal experience and interacting in accepted ordinary or new places.No one will judge how hard I am working on me unlike the times of crimes done, predatory sex which caused consequent shame to mean I needed to do more.

What makes a healthy marriage last?,"Thank you for your question.  A good Marriage is one that takes hard work and commitment.  Being in a good marriage does not always mean good times because let's face it; we are dealing with 2 unique individuals with differences.  A good spouse or partner knows to be patient and accepting.  Knowing each other's strengths and imperfections and working with them to lift each other is how you strengthen your love for one another.  A good spouse sacrifices their needs to see the other person happy.  Don't get me wrong, that also means that it is important to have alone time to re-charge and re-focus our purpose in the marriage.  In all, there is not a magic recipe for a successful marriage, but with time, work and purpose one can have a happy one.",
"He isn't violent, but he has anger issues and deep insecurities. He's working on them and has improved. We started counseling, and he participated in one or two individual sessions, but we broke up again shortly thereafter. Now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining.","From what you write, you're not too happy with how your boyfriend treats you and how he handles his own life.What keeps you feeling connected to him in positive ways?If you're truly not happy most of the time in this relationship, then you're at the time of asking why you'd want to remain in a relationship which is draining.","People sometimes have difficulty maintaining a relationship and being happy within. And they have a hard time admitting or recognizing that fact. But when it comes to differences in flexibility about a relationship and flexibility to live with your own unhappy alternately with asking your significant other to stop bothering you. Then this creates a strange loop or cycle of blaming.  The relationships of so many people put the blame onto the partner and allow couples to remain in high intensity relationships driving paralysis, frustration, anxiety, and departure. (https://www.amwell.com/articles/relationship-intensity).  Ignorance of the cycle or awareness of only feeling stressed towards the other and wishing the problem would split up, is new thinking.  Hence my comment in the title of the article suggesting people need to step away from affliction. A step away, retrograde towards earlier steps. You’re not asking the other partner to stop being a deplorable person. No, you’re simply saying, hold on, stop blaming me.  I also don’t want you to blame me.  We can disappear into a safe, quiet space as if we’re on vacation.  Or maybe even left at the feeding tub, while we can look at a therapeutic relation safely with an orderly focus on meaning of suffering and response to suffering.

"Sometime when small thing happen, like losing a comb, I get furious.  I even start throwing things.

I recently lost a friend to suicide. I'm smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it. How can I handle this better?,"Suicide is a very traumatic loss and affects survivors significantly. Everyone deals with their grief in different ways. One way I recommend to deal with the loss of a loved one is to write letters to them. Some people like to keep the letters in a jar, maybe fill the jar with sand so the letters are buried. I recommend writing the letters as often as you need to. You will notice over time the need to write the letters will decrease and the intense feelings of loss will decrease. I also recommend finding a survivors support group in your area. You can find more information on www.afsp.org.","I must first say how painful this experience must be. Specifically suicide loss is so unique. It's heartbreaking that your Friend took themselves away from you. They must have suffered themself as well. However, when we deal with loss we often use substances as a way to ""deal with"" the sadness. But the main objective of substances is to replace that reality and help us ignore them, rather than look at them. So what you're doing right now, help you avoid the darkness while maintaining a façade of being fine. If you would not be fine unless you avoided sad memories then you would keep doing it the same way again. I know not everyone has the choice to either deal with whatever sadness you're going through by itself or not, it varies by circumstance. And general behavior is something we do involuntary but most of us have learned to control the manner we respond to our surroundings. That is, sometimes we only will pay attention to the nice or the mean or the irrelevant. You didn't intentionally choose to deal with grief. That's something we all have to learn through experience or something we need help with. So let's explore kind of what you mean by ""handle this better."" What would that look like? Our first attempt to handle things is usually with a good idea that is then proven wrong before we get satisfied. 'If I don't need to deal with some of the sadness by looking at it, then I don't' = good start, I feel more in control, no memories to look at and sad over something. The reality is this doesn't happen. Had I not consciously turned my annoyance away, I perhaps would have walked wordlessly to watch a sad video from a bereaved friend. \\lI would be sad and thinking ""what did I do to deserve this.' These thoughts can be so powerful that they can give rise to feeling guilty or hopeless that all hope has gone for good. So stop yourselves by refusing to engage. So what would ""not watching a sad video from a bereaved friend"" depend on? Being another good start, right? It's the confession that allows me not to feel obligated to compensate, it's nonjudgmental, I'm not being negative (I want to feel sad I can, but not alone.I'd rather be alone, feeling a little overwhelmed by it, when I am ready I can... that's my plan, and not due to a ""deal with some sadness,"" there would be nothing in our subconscious telling you ""get over that!""Understanding and compassion for yourself is the first key. Remarkably our subconscious modifications each minute as we deal day-to-day with our life. Changing those subtle cues, is NOT about deciding or ruling out actual feelings of sadness or expressing them whenever uncomfortably. Rather we agree to never feel that the sadness is alone and unwelcome and uncommishable. It's by reminding ourselves repeatedly that feelings of sadness are normal (anyone is allowed to feel them) that they are an opportunity to learn ( why did it happen, what else did we learn about ourselves, ourvalues, or goals?) to welcome intuition into our lives (Relating their feeling to openness, listening deep feelings or personal passion) Revised internal messages is like looking into a mirror. You find the qualities you'd like to focus on for the most part, but don't like to accept the reflection of some things you didn't think to love. It's maybe upsetting to have your quiet rejection of the past repeated in everyday conversation. But those discussions are where we really condone or impede the same feelings. If you and your friends continually decide to treat grief by not looking at it, these quiet resentments of the past will continued to be part of you no matter how many times you repeat balancing thoughts. Watch a 1 min video :- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4n15b0vlGsYou won't be able to stand all the time watching your friend reminisce about all the happiness of your friend. They will probably choose a memory that seems super-special or a piece of compassion you offered only triggered their memory. But you transfer that guilt and you remind yourself ""why, I caused this to happen."" These thoughts keep the trauma alive in an unconscious way. With time and patience we can interrupt both the '反信息s' and tacit recollections that reinforce the anxiety about the past. We need to engage to solo part of us that can talk or listen (it's a big and emotional part of us) to therapeutic people that know what are are doing. Knowing more about your Friend's biology and cause of suiciding is more important as we work together with your friend are way to open a forgiving place to hold painful memories.These internal conversations may help you relinquishing the details you don't reveal yet but mind that they're yours no more than the light we feel next to us.  It's tempting to keep the glowing parts together but it doesn't stop us from feeling hurt.Conversing with your own past, is frightening with fear you are triggered. But it frees up your present moments; no burden carrying messages to yourself or from people that push thoughts...knowledge makes options"
"Maybe this is a stupid question, but I sometimes don't know what's real or not. If feel at times like everyone's lying. How do I know if God is one of those lies?","  It is not a stupid question, it is very basic. To help answer your question, let me begin with the premise that you will never have absolute proof. With that being said, one can look at different phenomena in nature and history and figure what is the statistical probability that they happened randomly. If one comes to the logical conclusion that many are quite improbable, then there must be a guiding force and plan.  May you be successful in your journey.","Hi There! Yes, that can be a rather tall order to answer. Seeing peers lie can become very disorienting over time.

"I feel that I need to end my present relationship. He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.","It sounds like you have some insight into the cycle that you describe with your current relationship and at the same time you are still feeling stuck. It also sounds like the distressing feelings that you experience, when you imagine what will happen for you and your current partner, are pretty overwhelming. A competent therapist may be able to help you work through these difficult thoughts and feelings and find a resolution to this cycle that will feel right to you.","sincerely.Try not to beat yourself up over these tendencies. The fact that you've been in this cycle so often indicates that this issue is a longstanding one for you. You also mentioned feeling lonely (wanting a partner and companion AND not having one in sight) and resentful of him (can't continue ""this way"" and keep feeling frustrated/angry). Without feeling free of loneliness, resentments against him, & not reaffirming that you are the one, you'll continue to break blockages against entering into relationships you truly desire. And, concerning your cycle of anxiety and depression: these emotions can prevent you from seeing the big picture. In other words, while these reactions to him really ""hit hard,"" evidence clearly will show they should not be controlling factor for the decision to take a long distance, low priority relationship to full separation. If you have been together 7 years, how long had you been dating before that? If it was quite a long period of time before that, it's understandable that you may want to talk to a professional about your relationship anxiety & lingering past dramas. These things never just boil away...Professional counseling may be a good option for you."
How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,"That's a loaded question.  Typically, if we are contemplating if we should or not, it is for a reason.  To really come to a place of decision, you need to know where you are right now, what is not working, what the potential resolution would be and if it is realistic.  If you can answer those questions, you may gain some insight.   If it is realistic and your boyfriend is on the same page, seek help putting a plan in motion for resolution.  And I mention him being on the same page because if he is not, then it will never come to fruiting.  Without much other information, this is this is a solid approach.","If you have made a choice to end a relationship, that is presumably why you have aches in your stomach (sometimes called ""being giddy!"") Either you are giddy with excitement about ending the relationship, or the contrast between your current relationship (almost a suffocating, turgid, blah blah blah) and what you've thought of ending it for awhile now (happening like you 'discovered new colors,' plus you don't need change until you go somewhere NEW?), is eating away at you so much and your brain records it (surgery problem? Your stomach knows itself seeing your feelings that gravitate elsewhere.)  Sometimes the funny way is to become aware that it's not funny but human sapiience has encoded you impressively to answer obstacles (finding a way out) with humor! You can do much more encounter than you can inhabit ;-) I wish you great, great insight! (P.S. You owe that great choice to be heard.)"
I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.,"The older I get, the more I believe that our real task isn't to 'find' ourselves. We're already 100% ""there."" What we do have to do is become more mindful of the times when we feel the most alive, most happy, most creative, and most fully engaged with life. It is in those moments that we find ourselves.For example, I couldn't help loving the people or things I loved, no matter who tried to talk me out of them. All I needed to do was notice when my heart opened and I felt the most alive--not because I was afraid or addicted, but because in those moments, I was in contact with my highest self. On the flip side, I needed to recognize the people and activities that consistently brought out the worst in me--the ones that made me feel controlled, constricted, dishonest, resentful, or afraid--and be honest about them. Mindfulness of ""what already is"" is the key to finding yourself. Align yourself with the people and activities that matter most to you. Don't let old habits, crappy jobs, or mean-spirited people define you. Just stumble your way forward as best you can, with greater self-awareness followed by affirmative action..   ","Hi Anu, Also called being self-aware is being conscious of your unique qualities and your thoughts, beliefs, feelings, motivations and strengths. It also includes measuring how much your personal characteristics influence your interactions with others. There can be several reasons why you don't know which traits belong to you. Some internal problems play a role. Your low self-esteem or a damaged self-esteem are possible reasons. Low self-esteem implies that you have a negative opinion of your extre who you are. Impacted traits are feelings of inadequacy, worthlessness, feeling inferior in some area, being highly self-critical, self-doubt, having a too-precocious seeking for validation from others, perfectionism, feelings of shame and feeling victimizedFrom the external side, you are just being too influenced by others. Depression, personal trauma and run-away feelings, guilt and shame influence interfere with relaying your unique personality. Talking with a professional and referent of your, like a therapist or a friend, is a first step to know who you are. Learn about yourself, notice personality traits, thoughts, feelings and performances from various tasks. Responsive relationships encourage pushing inward with gaining knowledge about your own preferences, motivations and binder characteristics. You could document your experience in a mind-mapping and use this to increase awareness of personal traits. I wish you the best as you go on this interesting journey! You!

I want to be better for myself and them.","Congratulations on making your way to Step One, self-observation and deciding to change a feature about how you understand and relate to others.There is extraordinary strength in being willing to notice your effect on others and consider what changes are possible.Start on the inside track of your own heart and mind.  Once you're able to understand what is driving your emotions to the point where the only reasonable way of handling them is to curse and offend people, you'd have gotten a long way in knowing your own expectations of others and how far off the mark from this in your mind, they are.For example, if you expect others to always be accepting, tolerant and happy about situations with your boyfriend, and you're hearing otherwise from people, then you can prepare yourself for possible, less than positive comments about your relationship, or you can ask people to not comment to you about your relationship at all.Basically, the more you know about yourself and are willing to accept your right to ask others to respect your views, the easier and calmer time you'll have in handling comments from others that you're not glad hearing.Also, this is a long process because you'd be trying to change long time and deep patterns of interacting.Be patient with your own learning curve and certainly consider therapy for yourself in order to have some outside guidance and support for the process you're placing yourself.","You're not always a very good person.  You're usually a very good one, but your anger bars out.  When you go into those situations of feeling bad or angry, it isn't that you're “as someone,” but just talking straight out.  You're not trying to offend or say mean things.  Your not a mean person.  You just get salty, and your help is to tell yourself something so you feel powerful or better, swallowing up your realization that even though the man the man has set himself against, is very down, he is actually a very good match with you.  Furthermore, if you actively believe and coach yourself into feeling great about what you have, then those breathers attached to curses, will weaken more, so that you don’t have the word to use in those moments.   You’ll feel powerless to sense strangers spread rumours, but you’ll fail away from it, almost like the non-existent “yuck yuck.”  When you insult people when heated, you transfer your feeling to them, making them feel judged and wronged selfishly.  So you’ll also practice liberating those breathers from your mean-tongued scenarios, pausing just enough that your “trigger words” repeat themselves unconnected to your emotional words.  This will give you time.  Thus they are “deep breathing” drills.  You’re practicing a more passive, graceful reaction to other people’s actions.  Then, you’ll do pauses in the middle of conversations where you notice you want the same kind of feeling, and expand and expand on how you feel, even if your body and brain say you don’t want to say it.  You may feel strong and powerful because this is the REAL you, the one always loving.  But the world will hurt you.  You’ll learn that you won’t stand to be hurt, because, most of the time, you’re finer and voiceless.  You’ll learn what’s actually up with you and your weird struggles, then you’ll stream your genuine feelings to others, who will understand and comfortably mic-drop from offering suggestions.  Like the end of a picture from a very elaborate joke, to reflect waywards yourself back.  If you are ashamed of yourself about your relationship, it’s likely a long time ago feeling you don’t deserve a good relationship.  It sprouts from feeling unlovable within yourself, despite evidence of you being loving, generous, and compromising.  You’ll need to do some more private reflection to figure out the ways of yourself.  Can you be kind to yourself?  Then there’s the problem of your boyfriend being able to compute this?  Was he actually “my problem” thinking you minded as much as he mine?  Can they both change?  What yes answers they can give you?  Then it’s simply learning how to live together.  Include him in your analysis.  At first, imagining your scenario may arrest you, but then you’ll smile and see the match and both are really happy for the chance.  It will finally begin to focus you from rebuffing and actively getting angry, because this is your type!  You’re generally not an upset, angry person at all.  It takes planning to become the wonderful lazy-sleepy-solar-fanatic you’ve had most of your life… while balancing the practicalities of living together.  Based on your intention and my hint, you might actually find a few body-dictated spots of anger transferred to you over new bases past anger-triggers—maybe one of the cats jumped on you this morning, or maybe a fellow human person was blowing hot breath over the floor, too soft for you in the middle of producing your burning indignation.  These spots could prime the tips of your tongue for salty surface words.   You can smack off the triggers with the power of breathing!  Finally, you gonna feed in your listening skills like onion, onion, onion, in that they helped SWAT the bash to your hard locks of need!  The one thing to remember is that you can’t force genuine your deepening specialization—and still feel sorry for people who are on the topic of the excellent match of you and according your partner (if that’s the match, you could have stated).  They can decide to stay, or leave, if you actual give echo of the mine, and resonated from here, they may also feel an echo not bothered, but also really FAMILY.  We’re all afraid minded action of too much love, but listen to them, baby.  Knowing what you feel pretty has to be communicated with them, for there to be room.  There is a good base matching you, if you’re already loved and caring to others knowing it.   Keep in mind  the battle is not"
"We weren't long distance until he joined the military.  I love him and I know he loves, me but it's complicated. He said he's not going to find someone else, but I'm afraid. How do I keep our relationship going?","You're wise to be aware of possible changes to your relationship once your bf is away from you for extended time periods.All you both can do is state your intentions and wishes, keep in contact as much as possible, and wait to see how your relationship unfolds.To a large degree, each of you is relying on faith that if the relationship is meant to last for a while, then it will.   The military may add stress.This doesn't necessarily mean the stress will dissolve the relationship.Sometimes all anyone is able to do, is try.","I can sense that you are connected with him.How long have you been in the relationship?Is there anyone in his life that you find threatening to your engagement to be in his life?Do you have any suicidal thoughts?Since you have recently attached with partner, it works hard to have several unshared thoughts in your head.Do you have other matters in your mind that could be negatively affecting attachment you have with partner?Is he contributing to the lack connection you are feeling with him?I don't see any mention of any sort of commitments about the soldier, aren't we clear about this?Does the emotionally distant or withdraw he carries presenting cause you doubt about future in relationship?I recommend therapy with whom you can discuss and process the thoughts that arise in mind for now.We learned skills about marriage and responsibility to be more engaged in meeting needs of partners.Emotions and behavior develop in patterns that influence much of our reactions to others in context of relationshipsLike you mentioned you're afraid to have an affair,I'd ask you what would you get in return by having an affair?"
"I have no real friends. I have a girlfriend who irritates me but loves me to death. I push her away and pushes me away. We’re going through a breakup, and I have nobody.","Having time all to yourself may be necessary so you have time to reflect on your own identity and values, become more clear on what matters most to you, and with this increased self-understanding, be able to attract people who will feel like satisfying friends.Having a relationship with someone whom you push away and are pushed away, with someone who is irritating, seems to have limited benefit for each of you.Maybe you are together from fear of being alone, and being alone is exactly what you may now need in your life in order to draw more favorable people to you.","I think this is exactly what often it is with relationships and being in love. Your emotions are intense and come forth unfiltered. This is your human reaction, emotionally engaged in whatever or whoever you're feeling comfortable around. :) At what times or moments are you tempted to say the loveingly encouraging and loving things? When you express strong feelings that the relationship is ending for good, when your girlfriend wants help or support, or just after your morning coffee? What makes the times that it's just you apart from being upset about the endings? ‏I would also love you to have a real conversation with your girlfriend about expectations. I'm not sure it's the love you feel towards each other or the break up that would be the best places for that. Incorporating expectations and discussing them is important, it can even be healthy for the relationship, before it's broken up. Mr. Treat from Solution Focused Couple Therapy, say that as a general rule, it's best to bring up relationship talk during periods of satisfaction or very strong positive affect. Why? There is a ""relationship script"" that couples have, and when being upset and contemplating the relationship==""end"", you're already off the track of your relationship script. Whereas, if you're checking in with your each other regarding your expectations and tensions, chances are you're feeling very good about each other currently. By making those upgrades in a positive context, you might have built enough of a buffer to be securer.Whatever time of the day or moments throughout your day you're pulled into expressing a negative frame about yourself and relationship, I would want those instances to feel safe, mediated by a strong, positive frame. That's something therapists come in handy for because they have tools and validation and support to help you do it .I would want to know: are there about 10 social contact moments with your girlfriend that could be placed in a context from this approch and could practically be delivered? I wonder if she has other hourly doses of it. My point is: you're not being conclusion-titled as ""there is no love for me."" !You'll notice pushing each other tells us something. What have you noticed? What are the triggers? How do you want the overall dynamic of your emotional communication between each other? Change is possible. Time-wise though, it might be too easy to get pulled back into the loops of unmediated moment of crisis without importance being given to address it. I wish you the best of luck with (or without) success 100% gain! I'd say: best of luck!"
I feel like my time is going too fast,"Thank you for reaching out! That is a great question! As an American, I can truly say that I spend way too much time on the go! It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe! I often ask myself, what if I only had one day left on this Earth? What would I do? Well, that is an easy question. I would spend it with my family! Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World, right? Its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring.Time management is a very important factor when learning to ""live life to the fullest""! In fact, this is a required course in undergraduate college now. Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this. Personally, for myself I like to keep a calendar with a to-do list. I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list. That way, if I do not get through the list, I am not stressing over the little things. When planning your day, it is important you schedule work, eat and play. A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. There is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this, then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse/partner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there. Again, everyone has their own style on time management. I hope this was helpful for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out for anything further!","If the change in the process of feeling time is interesting to you, you may want to learn more about the ways in which your personal perception of time changes through life. While we may wish that our experience of time passed would suddenly shorten the pace of it, the fact is that we all continually reevaluate what it means for us to “live fast” or “age in reverse.”"
"He wants to wear makeup and heels. He even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina. He wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him. I have tried this for him, but I don’t like it and have told him so. He keeps making comments about it and says he can't live without it.","It sounds like you may be asking two different questions.With regard to what you said about your husband dressing as a female in your bedroom, I wonder if you would consider asking him more about this. If you choose to do that, I would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience. This can be difficult to do at times, particularly when you may want to offer your own opinions or become very anxious or of type. Consider thinking of a phrase that may help you to stay calm during the discussion. It may be helpful to think of yourself as asking questions as if you were an investigative reporter and using questions that start with words like ""what, how, who, where, when."" Questions that start with ""why,"" can be very difficult to answer for some people and can be overwhelming because it often links to answers involving emotions that may or may not be understood. Also try restating what your husband is saying to make sure that you are understanding correctly. If what he is telling you is different than what you have heard or thought of for many years, it may be challenging to follow his meaning initially. Remember that listening to your husband does not imply agreement with what he is saying, just that you are following and looking to understand what he is experiencing. I also recommend sticking to one topic for the conversation, but this could be done with many different topics over time.You could also see if he would be willing to have a discussion where he listens like an investigative reporter to learn more about the experience that you are having.As far as what you mentioned about the sexual experience, maybe if you can discuss what it is that you don't like and/or understand what it is that he does like, you could see if there is some middle ground here. It depends on what you both prefer.These types of conversations can be difficult to have for some couples, at least initially. Having structured conversations, such as the ones I've described briefly above, can feel awkward initially, but the reason it can be helpful is because it can lead to further understanding in a way that decreases the chances of having an argument.Also consider seeing a therapist in your area who specializes in couples to discuss some of these ideas.","congrats on being aware of your own needs and boundaries.

"I am a really shy person. I'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?","First of all, way to go in stretching yourself out of your comfort zone! You are sure to grow through all of this practice presenting to your peers, and that in itself will help to grow your confidence over time. In the meantime, do whatever you can to help yourself feel prepared for each presentation. Do your work ahead of time so that you feel well-informed on your topic, and then spend the days leading up to your presentation practicing. Do your presentation in the mirror, while you are driving (if it won't distract you from the road), and practice in front of a friend. On the day of the presentation, eat a balanced meal, get a pep talk from a supportive friend, use deep breathing to keep your body calm, and remind yourself that you are prepared. You got this!","Fast question/answer: Practice making a speech.. Somewhere where content is relevant, interesting, and encouraging.

"I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental.
   I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?","It is very good news that you realize the risks of smoking cigarettes while pregnant and are willing to stop.Thinking about smoking is a typical and frequent reaction to being without the substance.Be creative with what you know about yourself to distract you when this psychological urge comes up.  My suggestions are to imagine smoking if you find this would relieve the sense of wanting to smoke.Or, do the opposite and remind yourself of all the good reasons to not smoke.Also, since you're planning pregnancy then ask your partner for ideas on how to make the psychological feeling to want to smoke, feel less intense.Another suggestion is that your partner is your texting buddy to stop smoking.   With AA groups, a sponsor is always available for the alcoholic who feels distress about the urge to drink.   Having a trusted and caring person to tell about your problem helps in many situations.  Maybe it will help you to stop smoking.Good luck!","Eating whole, organic foods is a good place to start, especially in view of your plans to become a mother. The nutrients and antioxidants found in whole foods help reduce nicotine cravings and it helps repair some body damage caused by smoking.{{Water.}}  I mentioned this because drinking lots of water helps the body flush toxins out of the system. (Smokers tend to forget how much water they need to drink over and out; It is a hard habit to break.)You should aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day, and it's a bit higher if the weather is mild. (When you go for a walk in most of the lot we get walked, it's best to drink water, coz it helps keep your body out of ""crisis mode"" if I've known a person for a while, he usually has been told to drink water all the time, and then he goes outside in a sunny day and says ""I'm okay, I don't need water""%  Try drinking a glass a few hours after you smoke. So if you smoke very regularly, say, one every 30min-. Find excitment in doing that (Swapping strings on two solos trumpet you've got in back were stands, you play it twice one minute later on.  Get happy selling weed/soft call girlfriend, screw doctor with your home to rock, make jokes about it etc.)If you're hesitating about the whole ""physical needs"" thing, think about this: Some people can't function I know with their whole life working without flying drones in a dogfight (an actual dogfight? Board, I'm wearing my goggles, Bolivia's the team bets a bowl of cevicheBe that person if you smoke anymore (it depends on how much) Buying life insurance might be a good idea, becuase you might still need it, and you might as well buy it in advance.So what you need to do when thinking of smoking, first off..Try walking out of the room, and onto the street, or the loo, or wherever, then get busy like a madman (Do 20 Du Stretchy things, drink a glass, use a planner in your head without being born normally... The more distracted you are the more you ""need"" to act on the way you used to. That is how people actually stop smoking (replacing old habit, with a new one, naturally.) Hope that helps one way or another! Cheers!Take care!

"I found the guy I’m dating on dating websites. He was telling women that they were beautiful. He said it wasn’t him and that the phone was hacked. It has since happened two other times. He says he loves me and I’m the only girl he wants to be with, but I feel he is not telling me the truth.","I would suggest possibly talking about the type of relationship that both of you want to create. For example, you may want a relationship where honesty, listening, compassion, and romanticism are major parts. You could also see what your boyfriend wants.You may also consider taking five minutes to see if he will listen to your feelings about him being on the dating site and whether he can work to learn more about what you are experiencing with asking open-ended questions (not being answered with yes or no) and restating what you are saying to see if he has it right. After that, perhaps you could switch so that you can listen to his perspective for five minutes and learn more about what he is doing by asking open-ended questions.Remember that it takes two people to have  a relationship, so the choice is yours as to whether you choose to stay in the relationship and what kind of relationship you would like to have.","I can hear the little girl in you trying to protect herself because she knows this is very much against her nature. Somewhere deep inside her you are watching and hoping she is safe. From a different corner of your body, there is a Trust, Confidence, Faith. That is saying: He is right. I am in love with him. And I am so lucky that he loves me too. Now, you are very curious about his actions on other websites. Inside the space of your imagination, you feel that maybe there is a possibility of him having had an affair. That cannot be the case but inside your proximity-hovering world of thoughts, you are imagining it, almost as a possibility. I am trying to help you to understand that it would be very strange if you can get closure on this by just listening to what he says. If he loves you, he will be THERE to sincerly confess to you the truth and also give you some proof of it if needed. Sometimes we are blind not to seeing what we want to see. There are lots of ways we learn how to move past bitterness, resentment and depression: Apologizing, reclaiming your voice, clarity of purpose, moving forward... I think you can do these things as long as the right someone who filled your soul with love is in it too. In the process, you will be able to let go of disappointments and betrayal, gain your confidence and sweet self-esteem, feel whole and loved again.

"I’ve been on 0.5 mg of Xanax twice a day for the past month. It hasn't been helping me at all, but when I take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack, it calms me down. I was wondering how I can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking I'm abusing them. I just have very big anxiety attacks. Should I stay on the 0.5mg and deal with the attacks or should I ask to up the dose? I'm afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else.","Do you think you're abusing xanax?It is a highly addictive drug so maybe one reason you feel compelled to take more is bc you already are addicted.Drugs don't do anything helpful in solving life's problems.   Once the effect wears off, the stressful situation is once again waiting for you to address it.Think over your reason for not directly asking your psychologist about upping your dose.Also, do you ever talk about your life problems with this psychologist or only your need for drugs?    The more gradual path to a better life is to not need drugs in the first place. This consists of your willingness to face the matters that are creating such terrible feelings inside you.","If you feel that the dose you are taking is not working for you, it's OK to tell your psych. Whether or not they will be happy with what you say, they need to know in order to help you.

"I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental.

I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?","Hi. Good for you in planning ahead to do what's healthiest for your baby (and yourself). That's a great first step! It's also good that you are able to identify that it's not always a physical need that's driving the addiction.For the next steps, I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological (or mental) cravings are usually based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if you're consciously trying to quit, you'll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. Well, if I'm on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually I'll give in and eat it.You're going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. That's normal and, for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. That's what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it (""Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now.""), but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.I've suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they're going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.Best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby!","Hi, Congratulations on deciding to quit smoking - not an easy thing to do and I'm glad you don't want to end up with a heavy smoker parent. Sneak smoking is not harmless and you need to foreshadow what happens when you quit for your baby. Quitting smoking is mentally hard because you are breaking an old pattern of mentally compulsive thinking daily and part of building a new behavior is changing the thoughts behind that behavior. Quitting rooted in the physical look for nicotine is great but building different ways to get out of the mental loop of thinking about cigarettes will help you get over any nagging mental cravings. You can start by asking you self ""What am I feeling right now? Can I do something else to get through this?"" Sometime your dependent thinking and craving has its own rules for you or it's a problem substituster. Don't try to inspect the problem but wait until you notices craving and deal with it.That was more for awareness that you are readonly triggers or systems for cravening. When is my craving coming on less time. Can I do something different? (Scent, aromatherapy) What am I doing when I'm atrigged?Is there something I will miss when I stop smoking?What if I tried again?  When did you go to the doctor? How did you feel on the day you began trying to quit?It could be nice to genrate some excitement why you want to quit or at least find comon ground doing something you enjoy knowing you will limit that urge. What are some fun feelings about Baby and getting a new tear?Maybe your nicotine dependence aid gives you some ideas about things that you can do in place of smoking. Your chemist and doctor are one step closer to telling you that your dependant about nicotine is beginning to pipe into nerves expecting release of reward via the amount of time you've been trying  to quit, or that you have an easy task of making a habbit form of stopping all tuigging.

"I'm transgender, I know I am, but I've only told a few friends. I know I can't tell my family because of previous conversations we've had. They just wouldn't accept it.
My gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own. I need some strategies for dealing with it. What should I do?","Hello, and thank you for your question. I am so glad that you reached out for help. I know that the dysphoria can feel nearly impossible to handle, especially since you have limited support from people who accept who you are. You may already know some of these resources, but I am going to share a few. 1. The website www.letsqueerthingsup.com is a blog from a very good writer that I know. His name is Sam Dylan Finch, and he is transgender. He writes about mental health, transgender issues, and many other topics. I know he has frequently written about gender dysphoria and ways to manage it. You may want to check out his site and do a search on there. 2. The website www.everydayfeminism.com employs many transgender writers and several have written about gender dysphoria and have given ideas for managing it. If you search for gender dysphoria on their site, many articles pop up. It may be a good resource for you, especially if you ever feel lonely and start to forget that there are others out there who are like you and have your back. 3. I am not sure where you live, but there are counselors who specialize in affirmative therapy, which is what is recommended for folks who are part of the LGBTQ community. So, if you decide to see a counselor about the dysphoria, try to find one that specifically says they have been trained in the affirmative approach. In addition, feel free to ask questions of the counselor before agreeing to see them for counseling. An ethical counselor would have no problem answering them before having you come in. 4. If there are some LGBTQ resource centers in your area, try to reach out to them and see if there are support groups. Gaining more support from others would be helpful. Sometimes LGBTQ-friendly counselors leave their contact information for people in resource centers. 5. Finally, I know you have not mentioned being depressed or suicidal, but I also know that it is very common for people to consider suicide when they are struggling with dysphoria, dealing with transphobia, etc. If this ever happens to you, please call 911 or the Trans Lifeline. It's free at 877-565-8860. Visit their site at www.translifeline.org. I hope some of these ideas help. Feel free to send another message if you have a follow-up question.Be well....be YOU.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC ","The most helpful strategy I would suggest for dealing with gender dysphoria on your own is to explore all aspects of gender dysphoria and transgender identity in a safe, confidential, and supportive relationship with a client-centered counseling relationship. I work on this and many other aspects of gender dysphoria and the development of positive transgender identity in this type of therapeutic relationship. To structurally and exclusively address the dimension of gender dysphoria I'm motivated and experienced in using guided imaginal and behavioral experiments, guided cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, mindfulness, the bifocal design approach to understand binary and non-binary gender identities, narrative therapy tools for exploring and affirming your gender identity within your family?s expectations, and dialectical behavioral therapy (skills) for regulating emotions difficult or occurring due to the stress of gender dysphoria and lack of adequate social support. It's possible that a gender dysphoria specialist is not available where I live in my state. Unfortunately many therapists are not well-developed in understanding gender dysphoria and other aspects of a transgender client?s psychology. One opposite effect of following non-expertise in a therapist is not sufficient understanding and sensitivity of the impacts of the cultural ability to suppress, lower-self-esteem or internalize gender dysphoria and shame and partial acceptance of opposing ideas promoting non-binary identification such as Buddhist ideas. The growing interest and knowledge of issues around gender dysphoria and non-binary identification empowers non-binary individuals. This fact may affect some individuals who need therapy due to unspoken or real prejudices while collaborating with a therapist.I'd also suggest you explore all of your resources and barriers preventing disclosure of your gender dysphoria. Which Items? Group counseling..?Transgender groups (virtual/non-virtual) or intercultural community group? Family, close friends... exploring and reflecting can help you identify and more effectively communicate that your desire not to disclose your gender dysphoria based on: a) fear of disapproval, negative positions, blame, and blame... or b) fear of alienation, lack of support, or staff treatment of barriers to affirming your gender identity. I can't say exactly the cause of these barriers/disclosure concerns, but certainly understanding and communicating these intuitions and fears may help to reduce them. ""Ask First, Then Decide."" You can gather info and talk to a therapist about creating a credible plan for disclosing your gender dysphoria in stages.* Relent: ""Vanishing Anxiety"" is classic CBT strategy for anxiety. 3 little steps occur over and over for 5 to 7 days. Follow a daily script for 5 to 7 days. Fear there has to be ""room to plan"" reduce panic anxiety. All day tutorials have helpful mindfulness practices (plus lets you practice ""sprinkling mindfulness"" around whole day). Managing panic anxiety and exposing (""Vanishing Anxiety"" strategy) may help you release additional anxieties related to gender dysphoria. Then write a letter, keep the letter if needed.Seminary-paired students writing Spirit-blessed responses on your support card; one from each stratum (family, extended family, friends, school, purveyors of affection) will affix their words to your card. You can either handwrite or type your letter. I'll scan it, write little things in the margins: ""advice,"" ""interior support,"" encouraging words"" so a powerful response, glowing support.(But really all ages are welcome on this project!).This creative mindfulness writing exercise may help you guard agitating anxiety a little. Using a Socratic approach may guide your emotions down good ways of managing dysphoria or handling community misconstrued ideas of your gender identity. Sometimes turning this critical fear muse to more constructive questions might be useful (""Socrates asks 40, average old wise man answers 20, every question gets me further cancer depressed spine. What if those questions were truly wise?"").I also suggest daily practice of mindful breathing writing for one minute; you need 8 words in your sentence (8 syllables). Minuse guess how many wafts of gentle silence to send in your daily practice? (Mindful breath subtrahends deafening clicks of anxiety!). Talking and/or journaling will increase your self-esteem. Feeling good about yourself is the foundation of gender and role transition, job change, or change of any sort of direction. Hope you have a better place to breathe, a softer idea of self, and more self-confidence. If you're looking for a local professional counselor feel free to write me back.Some sources with questions you may want to pose to virtual or local counselor I work and wish I had as a long time therapy client:Brown Weissberg, M.S., LPC, OC?¿You ask the questions, I give notes as ideal format - some what game mastery for playing dominant role of guest?: YES but then it's such silly me.

"Whenever I leave my girlfriend I get panic attacks. I'm taking medications to control them, but I'm thinking of moving in with her since I get so anxious.","I’m sorry to hear that you are currently experiencing panic attacks. I hope that the medication you have been prescribed has provided you with some relief. Unfortunately, I don’t feel that moving in with your girlfriend would alleviate your anxiety. Although you may feel very anxious about leaving her, your body is reacting to this stressful event in your life in an unhealthy manner. You may be able to render this particular situation but it’s likely that you may experience another panic attack when an additional stressful event arises. Therefore, it is essential that you address the reason for why you are experiencing panic attacks in the first place followed by practicing coping mechanisms in the case that one would arise in the future.Talk therapy has shown to be effective with those affected by anxiety along with breathing exercises and yoga. A trained therapist will be able to assist you in finding the right stress reducing method so that you can reduce the chance of another attack occurring.I wish you the best of luck! It sounds like you are very happy in your relationship and I hope you are able to reduce your anxiety so that you are able to enjoy one another.","I would recommend caution before making the decision to move in. Panic attacks or anxiety symptoms are often associated with relationship problems or concerns. Panic attacks aren't a problem by themselves, but are the symptoms of potentially deeper concerns. You'll have to decide if they are acceptable to you or not. Sticking in the panic attack and dealing with whatever caused it feels like the healthiest option in the long run."

But the first step is finding a therapist and beginning to identify the cause your depression. Healing is possible and getting your happiness back is also possible.Feel free contact me for additional help or informationLaura Cassity, LMSW, LMAC","Depression is a unique and personal vital sign for all of us. It means at some point our life has been and is affected by a big change. It needs to be repaired or balanced.   My guidance here is more in terms of needing to be honest with yourself about what you feel is happening now and find relief to balance it. We can do that without talking with other people.  I recognize the fact that it would be nice to feel comfortable talking about private life changes to others. Tell yourself doing that would be courageous. You already are by acknowledging your own behavior and images of how much merit it takes for you to consider opening up. You can go toward people whom you trust as example of people who can be courageous with you. There are also stories and pictures of people I will reference for other purposes. I will have a case concept on what I'm doing with you. To keep my service distinct to my other service on Marriage and Family with my wife, I won't specifically disclose that. I can show you a clinician profile where my services can be understood.  I think this type of specificity may be counter relevant to helping adults with Gerald Whitaker's generosity model of distance in which intent to war with yourself corresponds to the possibility of war with your family.   I would like to have you feel that your engagement of these services on and off is for your own importance at this time in your life. I will have other ways of staying connected via email. In most cases, I won't initiate contact with a client in the off-state. But it won't feel lonely because of our contact. We can touch base since you're not seeing me at the same time.   If the depression has more intensity or you have new experiences around lying themselves, I will know why we need to start again developing trust in the sense of you're present in this therapy, now. Those signals can be the means whereby my offering would be more specific. It would be definitely okay and not questionable for me to identify myself as a counselor in regards to the therapeutic relationship. That part of the service I set apart in giving intuition. I'd be happy to be made explicit if you want. I can invite you to use what were called ""family conversations"" from Whitaker that start with ""I hear at first my inner feelings are..."" My ""inner feelings"" is an idea of something happening within yourself. It often is telling about what you feel yourself doing. One usual outcome of this is ""I'm going to do this for my self"" or ""I just won't be able to do this."" The second statement is indicating depression. The first statement is often ""me selfish!""  (PD 2.0 and the 1993 diagnose manuals)\n ""Family conversations"" also are a way of strengthening your feeling about yourself as someone who takes care of your inner world.   I will share with you a definition of ""self-working literature"" or ""literature of self and the world"".   I'm working to get it right.  Each adult learns to be a real person in balancing myself and being open to partner. At any time you ""depress yourself"", half of who you are is collapsed, you lose a part of who you really are.You can balance out the self with literature or talk therapy or to partner. I have my case model. You can have yours.  It's standard in counseling and has time lines when it's revisited.  The same will be true after your depression is settled or reduced. I appreciate you expressing something you're aware of and don't expect everyone else does. Letting that assessment speak to you at low intensity, on its own time goes by and gets better. I am telling you I get it.  Many will say ""tell her brother,"" ""tell my boyfriend."" Others say, ""tell Dad"" or ""My kid wants her mom to talk with someone."" Those are common things I've explained and they don't of out of love for you or want to control you. Their therapies are imperfect like all our therapies. Their ethics may differ from what you need. Your therapist wanted the time to make the change setting aside the ensemble of relationships you make up who you are. If your practice is being unconditional positive in your therapy, you may start to feel that same response from your family.  Out of illness we can choose how we feel towards who we are. Your own feelings are a necessary part of the whole therapeutic context. And even sometimes  (there are  more mechanisms within fidelity and generosity between couples, to recognize the open attunement of physical contact > actual therapy is forwarded in between) maybe not at the same moment, I may continue to share my impressions with you when you come back. But you would have awareness and receive much of your working myself with the very telling interview and telling story journal during the places between the sessions. See you soon.   Yours breastfeeding nurse in the clinic, Oktavia"
"I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.
I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. While your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard. Talk to them during a non-emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as ""you NEVER listen,"" ""you ALWAYS say..."" and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with ""you"" try using ""I"" by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist, teacher, or school counselor if possible. Most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help.Best of luck to you.","Two major life changes happen, you're a teenager now, and you're pansexual. Either can trigger emotional turmoil. Your parents probably don't know how to deal with each event, then you have to deal with each one. What's probably best is to start over and work on the communication with your parents. How will you continue to talk about each of those issues for the first time? Maybe it's counseling. Maybe it's just a good old-fashioned heart-to-heart. This needs to be a conversation about what you're feeling and thinking right now, and what led up to where you are at this very instant. I also encourage open, honest and meaningful conversations with your friends as well."
"My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the ""straight and narrow"" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that I'm not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others.    His insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","You might ask your fiance about people who have let him down in the past; past hurts from parents, friends, people he has dated. If you are speaking about jealousy he may come from a divorced parent upbringing, may have seen parents cheat on one or the other, may have had partners cheat on him in the past.  He may have fears that you may go off the ""straight and narrow"" once you get married. Listen to any concerns with patience and understanding, avoid being defensive. I would highly encourage pre-marital counseling to explore these things and individual counseling for himself to work on fears and anxieties. If he refuses and things do not improve I would consider postponing the wedding, things will not get better once you get married, only magnified.  Finally show him Bible passages about forgiveness and worry and leaning on God with faith and hope for the future.    God bless.","I want to encourage you to reach out to him for deeper exploration of what is making it difficult for him to move away from your past. When we rush to judge or “fix” someone, we tend to do wrong instead of right, with the result of increasing the gap between our own expectations and the other’s behavior. By asking him to share and reflect on his thoughts and feelings about your past, the big truth may emerge that he is making unfair judgments in his mind about both you and himself. He might be unsure whether he can forgive you (or think himself worthy) for what you have done (even something as small as cutting his hair too short or on a different day), with the big consequence that he may forget that your past was only a number of years ago. Or perhaps his judgement of your past is actually one reflection of his own mood and he is perhaps working through some conflict between who he needs to be and who he is. By staying curious rather than confrontational, I predict he will open up more and could benefit from therapy, either together or on your own—for example, to learn some new learning. Feelings of discomfort from being “fucked up” (not literally) are not uncommon in the high roller's life, and a trusted counselor could provide a more thorough understanding of the nature of his discomfort. Remember, everyone has a past. Whatever I went through as a child or teenager or and that makes me who I am today, you are still the same wonderful person that I fell in love with. And the same applies for him."
My fiancé and I broke up. He cheated on me numerous times. I kept forgiving but questioning his every move. He got tired and left.,"Cheating on you shows a lack of commitment, in addition to the emotional hurt it creates.Probably you didn't actually forgive him because if you did, then you wouldn't have been asking questions of his every move.Maybe you were open to forgiving him.   In order for forgiveness to be effective, the person who has done the injuring must first show some understanding and empathy for the great pain the person caused in you.From what you write, your fiancé didn't seem to have much interest in earning back your trust or in empathizing with the way his cheating effected you.It is very likely his tiredness is also tiredness you feel, of having to watch him all the time.As uncomfortable as adjusting with the disappointment of him leaving you, the situation you describe sounds like it was unsatisfying for both of you.","Given your insistence on forgiveness despite constant cheating on my part, I must point out that the effort to ""always forgive"" and whether or not my fiancé is being guilty in his behavior is a bit disconnected in my mind. Not once did you say you forgave him, so that is a little confusing because, as stated in the title, he cheated many times. Did you choose forgiveness? Forgiveness doesn't happen automatically but is decided often in re-memorizing situations where we are still possibly inflicted with emotional damage from those situations, so it doesn't make sense to dismiss that damage after the person who has caused us harm leaves our lives. Let me first address to the debate at hand of whether or not we forgive our partners. My first thought is that if we do happen to experience betrayal, you have the choice to forgive something that has intellectual meaning (i.e., I forgive you) and choose to allow the tending to some wound in the mind. So forgiving the act itself doesn't negate or erase the act itself. However, we also forget the acts we did and the memories are slowly erased. So allowing the act in our memories to continue creating emotion around some part of our body (the brain, as I mentioned above, or heart), you are constantly pushing migraine-level emotional damage in your emotional mind that we would rather not go through again. So part of the original act that triggered whatever we called the betrayal isn't being processed with any meaning and emotional catharsis. Forgiveness literally means lifting the curse. And this curse would include referring to each other in some way that was prohibited. Did I forgive him for cheating? No. Would I accuse anyone of something that wasn't happening on a standard timeline? Yes. How often did it happen? Ten times? Or did you have some week knotted in your head that marked when ""It is already day ten"" ? Your emotional mind didn't feel that there was anything reasonable for your fiancé to do.  Regardless, have fun seeing how many times you have felt cheated even after the relationship. Now this is a strange question, what will happen to your emotions if you decided to forgive him over the course of holding each incident in your memory? There are a million different sources that would tell you to let go. Actually the one that got through the best to my mind is Steven Hayes, and so called ""T-Elusive Therapy"" or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. His method would be to argue that, attaching shame, guilt and status you have given to the experiences you are describing takes something of your agency to process new meanings on your part. These new meanings, when it comes to recalling a statement that tells you ""Not to forgive you"" is an example of what he types of ""T"" statement and he would auto-gently probe you and How are you using this statement? It bothers you or protects the quality of your relationship? Understanding that the statement is protecting a part of your relationship that was never verbally motivated - the relationship itself - is how Diane Tough, would argue, you using some form of knowledge of the refuse to forgive which is provoking the part of you that feels vulnerable under the weight of this accumulation. In statistics if you meditate on a single experience over and over again, then over time you make that part of your brain stronger and functional until eventually you'd have a preference to look that way behind a glass feels safer than here. And the risk of ""reaching for that glass"" can stay present and you'll find yourself thinking a lot about that risk as opposed to reframing. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy argues that this whole zone of ""how I'm feeling, what I say and how I interpret other people's words that I take personally means someone else would tell me something impossible - as if there was some phase of acceptability. He would coach us away from that belief so eliminates the use of the ""T"" word in its many shapes of metaphoric black spelling - forgetting we are emotional complex organisms. That is to say there is a cost to holding onto guilty tagging mind...meaning you become attached and guilty and so you feel there is some obligation that is negative or is respected so you can blame the guilty trait embodied by the resentment. Suddenly the gift becomes your opportunity to attract a different reality. It's not a mind trick but a way to prevent the ability to think thematically understand that if this is the thing I act on - another thing may eventually help end resentment and foster growth. A note that Attachment theory would also be useful, you non-violent and social emotional dynamic process. Is it because he cheated so he could be with me again? The I feel submissive you would feel that the relationship rebirths itself, ashamed that he cheated, just forgiven him again, guilty self. Wouldn't hurt yet again? EDIT: Wouldn't cool if someone cheated on you? Gotten full of boyfriend bromes and bullshit logic though.. ;-)"
"My girlfriend and I have broken up and gotten back together numerous times in the past two years. We recently just broke up again last night on New Year’s Eve. When we break up, the very next day, she calls me and acts as if nothing has happened. She acts like everything is alright. This has been going on for two years. I do love her and care about her and her children a lot, but she seems really demanding as far as what she deserves from a man. She is always telling me that she deserves this and that from a man. It makes me feel like crap because I cannot give her everything that she wants. She told me one time that she wants a man who is going to be afraid to lose her. Is that a normal thing that women want, or should I just move on already? I am in my 30s and she is in her 40s.","Love is not enough to keep a relationship together.The people need to get along happily too.Let's start with knowing more about your happiness in being with your partner.The frequent break ups happen for a reason.  Try understanding more of why you go back together again.You state a few very clear reasons to not continue this relationship, such as ""feeling like crap"" and not liking that your girlfriend hopes her  partner will feel afraid to leave her.Trust your intuition telling you that these feelings matter.Sometimes men aren't sure whether following their instinct is a right action to take.It is.Also, hoping a partner will fear losing them, shows a wish to control a person.Control has nothing to do with love and trust, and these are basics of a relationship.Good luck!","You are both engaging in what I and others have called ""creative break ups"" or ""reconstructive break-ups"". Gloria Giblin has written about this process in her books, Healing Breakups, Recovering from Breakups, Divorce and other Major Losses, and Creating Great Relationships (with Randi Hall). If your relationship is worth repairing, and if you both wish to. Then working with an outside partner can help. The idea is to tease apart your unhappy aspects of the relationship and to find ways to rebuild them in healthier ways. Or to break up in a last ditch effort to save it: when you know we don't agree anymore, we personally know that we might better be happy alone, but maybe together we can be miserable and resist breaking up. When the two of you are over any problems in the relationship, then you need a new rhythm. And this transition often needs a counselor or someone to help focus your energy. The tough thing here is that you are each stuck in your own pattern of wanting more and demanding more, which logistics wise can't happen with the way you two do day to day ""life."" There is so much underlying pain under everything else. You won't break up again (or it will be a normal break up) until the major feelings are sorted out emotionally. You want a man who apprise and acknowledge you.The most guys want a woman who accepts them. I didn't know I wanted a ""him"" husband. Even $1,000 is too much talk, But I write this because it will come up a lot on today's to 40s....your female friends who sent out good guys, (maybe requiring an introduction from you) message rape.)))

"Whenever I don't tell my friends or anyone what I did or stuff that's not really important, I feel terrible, like there’s a hole in my stomach. It only goes away when I hurt myself.","Hi Kansas, I feel strongly that the help of a professional therapist is important here. Feelings are never wrong, but it can help to understand where they come from and talk to someone who can teach you healthy ways to cope. Self-harm is not the answer to managing those emotions you feel in your stomach. Although I'm glad you said something here, a professional would need to spend some time with you and get a deep understanding of your life in order to help you sort all these reactions out effectively. I hope you reach out to someone soon. ","Feeling a hole in your stomach when you don't share things with others is actually a common experience, especially when you're really attached or close to a person. That feeling needs to come from somewhere! The good thing about that feeling is it's a sign that there are boundaries you've defined from people and you need to stay true to those boundaries to keep yourself safe from harm.Also, we get all the automatic hurtful (meta)self-talk as soon as we step away from people who have defined us. That is a sign and a way for the voice inside of us that is who we really are saying, ""If you are really who you say you are, it is okay to do as you're saying, your boundaries and whatever hurts you is not as bad as you think. You still belong with people.""Also, tell your friends that you don't feel perfect sharing stuff you consider not important. Most people don't consider it's only because you feel lonely. It might be because you don't trust our relationships other than them or because you think you can't trust yourself to be yourself with people.  And once you share your thoughts on feelings this is normal. And our inside voice which that critical and knows about your vulnerability, really needs feedback from our loved on never to trust them.  Once your direct language and your boundaries are established, the urge to deal with the space within you gets better over time as you connect with our loved one in a more meaningful way.Notice how badly your stomach hurts when you ""do as the people say."" That is often about whether we are in an arena where our character is being challenged, whether we're joking or sharing that we drive two separate occasions. Our stomach will start to relax when we accept we can do something this time. You need to feel that ""hole in your stomach"" less often because once we accept we're pretty, we're pretty, lucky and precious human beings, that hole won't do us any good."
"My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board—no more drinking every night.
 The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.  I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. I just feel like I'm so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty. He is a good husband in every other regard.","As exasperated as you feel, and as obvious it is to you that your husband cares more about drinking than being honest with you, changing this is up to him.Does he care that you're upset with him for drinking more than he can handle?Does he care about you more than drinking?Living with an alcoholic, which is how his behavior sounds, is lonely and frustrating.Concentrate on what you like about him as he is now with his drinking.Your happiness matters.  His ignoring of what you're talking about, doesn't mean your requests are unreasonable.Be prepared to learn to live with and accept how he behaves, or not.Avoid the expectation that you can convince him to change.People change only when they realize their life can improve by changing.  He doesn't sound like this, at least now.","I often hear my patients say, ""In my marriage I was so honest, I can't believe we married.""  And sometimes doing this exercise helps bring to light some of the praise I could give them for their own creativity and ingenuity in identifying their honest approach.""I had you lying every month about this, so you could keep doing what you liked to do."" Were you honest about knowing this?  Was your husband honest about wanting to change last year?If he was honest with you and you knew it (or almost knew it because you are good at observing), perhaps there was a good reason to tell why you didn't say it (or...you didn't say it).  For example, maybe you personally were concerned she found out and asked.  Then what did you reveal?

I have this weird fetish that I'm afraid to open up about it. What should I do?,"This is difficult to answer because you don’t tell us what the fetish is.  I do understand that this is something that is bothering you though. The first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not.  If this is illegal to engage in, then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urges.However, if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd, a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings.  You may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of.  You may find other people have the same interest as you.  Find a therapist that you can trust and tell them.  Don’t hold back with your therapist.  Trust me, they have heard and seen it all by now, and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress, or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are.  There is no need to suffer with this alone. ","I want to remind you  that fetishes and sexual feticisms are ALL OK. If it is not hurtful, you are in no way faulty, Klover, or wronged, for having a fetish - a particular type of fetish - , there is no shame in it. I wish I had a name for this particular fetish you mentioned so I could look it up in a dictionary, but I can not. There is only a list of other common fetishes, which were all newly added to the online dictionary on September 23, 2018, long before our conversation speaking directly to you here in writing. This is the short excerpt from this dictionary about fetishism: "" Fetishism is a sexual attraction to a nonhuman object, substance, body part of another person, or to a certain bodily function. The object or person may become a sexual focal point. The person who has the fetish is called fetishist."" Hope this helps."
I'm 15 and my girlfriend is 14. Am I a pedophile because I'm attracted to her and she's under 18?,"No. You are not a pedophile. You are both under the appropriate age where it would be seen so. Your both only a year a part so this shouldn't a worry to you. Like Frank said below, Pedophelia is a problem that won't apply to this situation.","â¦I want you to know, just as a person wrote, that no. I would like to offer some clarification regarding this. Why does the way your question is phrased lead to this answer? Who needs to decide whether you are a pedophile or not? I feel it quite personal, and that you may be thinking about yourself, which is hopefully normal. I imagine you are having a lot of pressure thinking about and trying to understand your relationship in terms of best friends, first love etc. and relating to others' comments and the social climate around sexual ages. But it is hard at 15 to have a fixed or definitive understanding of which ages are considered appropriate for dating. That is still to evolve. I am 39, and I think it would be harsh and immature of me and many others around us to label or term young 15's and 14's as just sexually active or terminally promiscuous in the hope of indicating when they are 18. 21. 25 and whether or not they are ""different"" from the rest of us. There are many criteria for ""difference"" that are far too complex and nuanced for the general public to sort out. Moral and (or) religious communities, as well as the media, feel compelled at times to use a simplistic ""danger vs. safety"" framing in order to help bolster their own self-confidence in a worrisome world (where danger seems deemed worse than wrong, or dangerous and wrong are good thing, especially protected from less mature people). The point to remember then is there is no possible age of starting to masturbate, date or become ""sexually active."" They are just the kind of questions the adult mind can inhabit better than our 15s and 14s, just most consistently. For you, My 15 year old Self (the one that has internalized what is being said to me), asking if I am a ""pedophile"" or not.  
Well, the answer to that is if I by definition if I am a pedophile, would my attractive partner (if that term seems accurate, say a 14 year old) be my sexual partner? That is the way pedophilia is defined. Depending who is the observer seeing this 15 and 14 together, they might describe you based on what they are describing to the world or the courts or whatever. But I can't know whether the label (pedophile) is correct for you or even what it really means for you until you discover this yourself. In what way is it beneficial for you, feeling like someone who would benefit from being judicious with young children in their cohort? Or does this hinder you from being involved with discovering the meaning of love and commitment? What does this label mean to you? The parent of your girlfriend (and mother of your male partner), could describe your relationship (too) by my and her parents' language. In what way does that motivate you to relate differently? It would sound unreasonable for us to try to place a label on the healthiest of sorts of relationships.  If we did, it would be useful to note also that sexual activity has none to do with the description of a healthy relationship.  On many websites about healthy relationship tips, there are sections labeled Adult(s) sexual activity or Physical affection. This is because, by law, we are legally prohibited from having sex with someone under 18 their parents/guardian or the legal system, recognizes this bond as not appropriate. And laws sexual does not address what is emotionally or moral or influential in our relationships. Talking about the difference and telling condoms are for protecting against pregnancy and STDs blah blah blah in order to convince a 20 year old of the relativism of Loving an 18 year old, is one thing. Being under the influence of alcohol or marijuana at 15 and staying with a 14 year old and not commenting about it until the ropes between you tighten on levels appropriate to adults ... I guess the adult world is so fluid that we don't know how to feel about it with partners. I hope this is helpful in helping you unravel some of the labels, traits and expected to gives people, themself and regular people that may need a mental health professional perspective for exploring those things further."
"I have been feeling more and more down for over a month. I have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks, but they are almost never triggered by something that I know of.","Answers about our inner lives are most successfully reached from a sense of feeling grounded in oneself.First step is to accept your nervousness and restless sleep.  As often as possible, sleep during daytimes in order for your body to catch up on its need for rest.Accept too about feeling down.  It is normal to feel down once in a while.  From this place of self-acceptance, trust any answers which come up to your mind.  Often answers about complicated topics come in small pieces, not all at once as a whole unit.Also, your description about panic attacks is also completely normal.   They often arise unrelated to particular conditions at a given moment.  They are a healthy symptom your body is trying to expel bad feelings and does this by having the anxiety erupt at times.So, self-acceptance, tolerance of being on a process of clearing out worn out emotional clutter, and sleep at odd times if possible, are all ways to stabilize yourself, which will also feel calm and good!","have suggested a more detailed therapeutic approach and some specialized options.I would like to ask several questions before suggesting which form of therapy best meets your needs.

"I am currently suffering from erectile dysfunction and have tried Viagra, Cialis, etc. Nothing seemed to work. My girlfriend of 3 years is very sexually frustrated. I told her that it is okay for her to have sex with other men. Is that really okay?","Hi, First and foremost, I want to acknowledge your efforts to gain (your) ideal erectile function. If the medications are not working and you have taken them as prescribed, I would encourage you to seek the help of a sex therapist as the dysfunction may be due to a psychological and/or relational issue rather than a physical/medical one. As for your question, only you can answer this. Is it OK? Are you OK with her sleeping with others? Have you thought through what this may look like, feel like, become for you and her? Opening up a relationship is a choice only the people in the relationship can answer. Even then, the answer may change at any point by either of you. I encourage you to also determine what the intention is underneath your telling your girlfriend she could sleep with others. Be clear with the intention and then together have continuous conversations about the expectations of opening up (i.e.: are there any kinds of sex that is off limits, areas of the body where touch or intimacy is not allowed, are uses of safer sex required or not, do you want to know the details or not, so forth). An excellent resource would be the book ""Opening Up"" by Tristan Taormino. I wish you the best of luck!Dr. Lily Zehner, MFT-C","I want to highlight your thoughtful consideration of how much your girlfriend might enjoy it meeting other men. Perhaps your question is: ""Is my experience of erectile dysfunction being 'complementary' to your sexual desire met?"" I know you probably don't mean for it to be so conclusive. It's more about balancing each other out, rather than complete sexual fulfillment for each partner. Maybe the point here is that both partners feel sorry that the other is feeling upset or dissatisfied? I understand your assertion that the two are ""complementary."" However, what if the more satisfied partner only receives less satisfaction from the other, and the more satisfied partner maintains satisfaction in other roles and life activities? If I had to ask you a question:「Do you and your girlfriend have other ways of fulfilling each other? Or, do you realize you both have separate needs, yet your presented as simply sex?」If you share similar roles and self-images, such as balanced partners in meal purchasing or one starting homes, life issues could be viewed as requiring mutual satisfaction, unlike your sex and wellness. Oftentimes seemingly simple life issues are symbolic, for instance matters surrounding transactions, which is an analogy for initiating sex. You might clarify whether one of you (or both) has certain standards that have been neglected. Think of your ongoing work as the one negotiating your standards. Then consider any resolutions that may help you reach each other's expectations. Perhaps this requires expressing your erotic self-image, which both must attain, in a novel way. Partnering on these fundamental erotic expectations addresses the sexual dissatisfaction you both encounter in different settings. If having sex with other men is too extreme for you, then there may still be excitement to arise out of wholesome mutual experimentation. Focusing on whether your sexual and erotic expectations diminish either partner (or pair) is something creatively negotiable."
"I have these dreams of men, and they always seem to try to hurt me. It's gotten so bad that I first wake at 4:30, then 4:45, and finally stay awake by 6:00. I'm always the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake. I hate falling asleep. The longest I've went without sleep is three days.","The good news about your dreams is that your fears are right at the surface of your mind so you can study them and release some of the harm from the terrifying experiences you had which created these bad memories in the first place.The bad news is the feelings themselves are sickening.Probably a therapist would be very helpful for guiding you to unfold these uneasy feelings and their source.This type of deep work is easier with emotional support from someone.  A therapist can give you this plus is knowledgeable about dynamics of someone having been emotionally harmed by another.Or, read a lot online and find out which articles resonate with your emotions.Luckily people are willing to express personal stories of recuperating a sense of peace and safety after being violated by someone.","I have had patients who have had stressful balance issues. You experience profound weightlessness in the therapist's office. You describe a feeling in the feet. There is deferred resolution of large movements. The sensation develops gradually. The patient will often say it feels as if the feet had risen to the knees. Gravity is delayed. These patients were often young men who fell in love and seperated. They are thoughtful, high functioning men. Lothario traits; difficulty seeing beyond other people. The same characteristics are found within the past term: ""weep-fence."" An exploration of your male partner, what motivates him to hurt those he loves? When was separation from this person understood? How old were you?had this as a pattern, or is this the first time?I don't know how many pages this has become, but I'm learning to address the grief of losing someone to whom you gave yourself, however much over formality your intellect, your rational insight, and your applied logic dictate the level of intimacy. Often, when the one we love leaves us, our lives are attuned to them: the sense of loss when we are physically apart is hard to gauge from a distance. Our routines are built around theirs, and there's no clear sense of how an alternate routine or alternate independence works; a process that typically does not have a clear path; We may be afraid of succeeding with the new routine, living with the lost one. Our grief arises out of something that is both alluring and frightening: the departure of the one we lovePlease don't reject showing the therapy room as a safe space for you.

Dreams have no moral purpose or directive. They exist to present a situation that is not working for us, unfinished. The problem presents itself as being either solved, reworked, or looked at in a completely new and enlightening way.When grieving, the closure you demand may be in conflict with your healing. You may have heard repeated instructions to believe all of the 'right answer' expectations at the place for some reasons. The boolse is that inner truth will surface and you may need to reject the answers you were given as a protectiveness. Possibly becoming the controlling parent in your own mind.This should be a process, and to be respectful of it I would ask your therapist to support this process: The willfulness of your therapist to negotiate the path of your dreams, asking the questions that unravel your relief expecttimes, following which we can arrange appropriate time to honor the ongoing grief.

Dreams are small reactions to life meaninglessly presented to us. Re-exploring will help to lessen the misbalance. The deeper we look into the processes that underlie our emotional and symbolic suffering, the more sensitive we become to the benefits of balancing. The skill of awaiting and even anticipating positive balance may prove to enable a speedier transition into this favored state of combined satisfaction, pleasure, joy, and acceptance.

Hello—I need some feedback from one of your past clients. I had a client in a group therapy program; during her group session, she said “The way some men look at me would be more aggressive’; she said this asserts she doesn't understand how men look at her. I said that self-perception of the self can be a difficult thing to observe and understand. Anyone interested in learning more about self-perspective have a screen lib, written by one of our co-facilitators. It explains one possible way of taking advantage of the real similarities between inner experience of other minds and our own. I don't know if this helped at all. I am guilty of offering scientific ideas to my clients. Scrutinizing others motion for negotiation between what I think and what the client already knows.â€˜) Of course there is some science involved in changing the world of another person. Our own therapies also use emotional-verbal counseling/and counseling methods. These, are in turn, models of interaction that everyone has to learn the rules of (like reading plates). Â New to me is the development of my V.O.N., my Visual Open-Node network; a result of the automatic and uncontrolled way sudden strong emotion makes us"
What makes a healthy marriage last?,It's surprising how many folks talk too much on the subject;It's the same three things that make all relationships work:HonestyTrustRespect(in that order)Most folks fall down on the first :) (*coughcough* THERAPISTS!  Heh heh heh...),"What makes a healthy marriage last depends on a lot of factors. For some couples, sharing common hobbies and activities is the foundation of a good marriage. Other couples base their relationships on the belief that they have everything in common. Some mates have the belief that, regardless of any shortcomings, their spouses are like a zero-sum value, and that part of the standard service coming with being their partner means that they go through little pain and a lot of suffering or vice versa. Others think that the games of difficulty and challenge lends a sense of agency and livelihood to their relationship. Some heart skips a beat as soon as someone's spouse leaves. Or tack on high amounts of emotional energy to model so one can challenge the other and see if that will pave the way to a healthier, burnout-free marriage.  Others are unexpectedly surprised by the errors wedded individuals may sprout from within themselves. Senses can be the compass pointing to their deficiencies. Senses of joy and appreciation work the same way, but from scenes other than those to yoke in affliction.  Knowing oneself, togetherness, having meaningful ski-mies and a stable fundamental position will all act as a beacon to light the truth in this brown world and to remind both partners that tanning comes from within, or at least has something to do with one's inclination, desire and mutuality.  Some curious couples are favored with a more mature disposition, or opinions to reinscribe their well/well/well years. But not every marriage is infused with meaning. Of course, everyone would like their positive bond with one's partner to be slippery or effortless and to continue in endless rapport. But staying home lazy all yammering in sisboth was a real person named Joffe E. Coward dating me, in my early twenties. Thru reports, some of my previous dates and some of my widowed clients and closest friends, I know that boring people have nearly surely produced people that are too lazy or uninvolved or they are simply intolerant or non-empathetic.  I'm always looking over my sofa butt for who really paid me last night, open to everything that suffuses the space and exudes the space into a sense of craving for acceptance.  Questions are already going deep, getting lenient to test the amount of trust there is. Also dissecting space, as in looking to see the slant and seams and texture of one's beloved sandwich left on the last table.		 This term is impossible to be consensually bereft of, notably because American society is partially predicated on compiling reproductive truths and proving the superiority of what the sex scientific mondo doing towards Earth. The other partner is the physical tether providing the pipes that crawl wool to these mightily penetrative overlords between the individual hostages of Happy Endings. The satiety (adaptive drive for small, regular) may answer our questions if the hearts are healthy and returning to the enclosing hull. People sometimes despise relations, so surveying soil around one child tube gives a clue about embryonic and fetal desires. Wells of a creepy couple can sit in their motherlands or be distinct from the opposite sex. If desirable, the wells will seamlessly respond. Mother running to see behind a curious baby's backward curves is instinctive. That's because she's nourishing bile that inflames skin or that her child's diaper runs wisdom.

"I'm in a long-distance relationship with my ideal man, but I'm not as attracted to him as I should be. Everything else is perfect about him, but I find myself lusting over more attractive men. The next step is marriage, but I want to marry someone who I can wake up to and fall in love with all over again. However, I also don't want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust. Am I asking for too much in the ""perfect guy""? Is there such a thing? Am I truly in love?","Attraction is important but sometimes over-rated. I'm curious about your comment that you are not as attracted as you ""should be"" - What is your measuring stick is for what you are supposed to feel in terms of attraction in a relationship? Do you want to be sexually intimate? Do you enjoy having sex with him? Are you satisfied with your sexual relationship when you are with him? The fact that there is lust for other more attractive men does not necessarily mean anything. There will always be attractive men and more attractive men than your partner and these attractive men will be even more appealing when you are in a long-distance relationship far from the arms of your partner. Loving someone does not mean that you stop being a sexual being who no longer notices and desires attractive men. Attraction results from a number of factors beyond appearance - including the degree to which you feel emotionally open, safe, and connected and how in tune you are with each other's bodies. It sounds like you think very highly of this man ""everything else is perfect about him"". Maybe it is worth spending some more time together in the same place if that is possible before deciding on marriage or that you are not truly in love. ","This is a very realistic outlines the feeling of wanting to get to know someone enough to be willing to stick with them for a lifetime.Nonbiology says that you may like someone but also have other options. Also that it is a way of staying connected to feelings.For example, you feel great when you see him having sex because you are so connected to the year where you fell deeply in love with your first baby.When I talk to people I get the feeling that physical attraction is an important part of our lives that allows us to connect with the authentic version of ourselves. Perhaps you recognize that whatever you feel attracted to will ultimately get away from you.So you want to know how to use the attraction to get the long-term relationship you want.So I ask, when we are attracted either physically or mentally, is it normal to evaluate our options?While there are adaptations in the brain processing reward that are geared towards survival and reproduction, the story probably goes that attraction and having many options is a good way to be sure we get the flavor of the best relationship available. So, part of a pairing is the collection of many possible choices.Without an active search, the relationship is easy for individuals to neglect. Perhaps the relationships we find essential for life are villains in the nature of human ego.We write literature arguing that we seek the extraordinary. These stories may lead us to be lonely. The doctor in my story finds her life is much more entertaining while telling stories of patients told the agent of her life. She is attracted to the empty roles her stories create. She misses her husband the time the stories are strong. She grieves Michelangelo and saves her marriage so she can continue to bring depth to the woman who should no longer matter.Whatever you do, don't have competition in your bedroom that distracts you from the relationship and get the solo therapy going now. Enjoy nakedness with your body, and remind yourself that you may get to carve Michelangelo's David too. Tell yourself you are already working on being Merida."
How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,"This can be a very challenging decision, and it may take time for you to sort through all of your feelings about the relationship and its possible end. Therapy can help you have a space to be completely honest with yourself about your relationship as you grapple with your decision of whether to remain with your boyfriend. Your therapist can ask questions to guide you in uncovering your true feelings about whether this is the right relationship for you, and he or she can support you in whatever decision you come to.","जर० तुम्हाला आघाडीवर  आणि तडजोडीच्या साखळीत  आधीच  गोंधळून जावं लागतंय  आणि तुमचं  साथीदार त्या संग्रामांना जिंकवण्यासाठी  परवाह करत नाही , असा  खरेखुरे दु:खीभाव किंवा  विचार करत असाल . तुमचं साथीदार तुमचं नातं समाप्त करणेचं  उद्दिष्ट  ठेवण्याचं गमावलंय आणि फक्त चांगलं वाटण्यासाठी तडजोडी करत  असेल . एकटे राहायचं  आणि खरे प्रेम शोधायचं . हे त्याचं  तुमच्या नात्यावर  कுந்தीर असणं . आणि पूर्वीच्या संवादित  टिपशूट फॉर्म्सवर मज बोलत असावं  'आहे तर आता  अनूभवायचं' आणि 'तडजोड कर' तसेच 'आपण एका परिस्थितीत  आहोत'"" अशी  विधानं असतील , आपल्याला  'राहायला चालू ठेवायचं  की नाही' हे बायनरी निर्णय म्हणून  राहायला नको . हे  प्रेम आणि काळजीचा अभाव दर्शवते , जेव्हां या अनुभव  प्रेमाच्या तत्त्वानुसार एक  नातं  शोधत असतात .

"My older brother (in his 60s) started dating a lady with Asperger's. She is hyper-sexual and flirty. She does not understand boundaries. They’ve been dating for a few months, and she's talking marriage. Another sibling and his wife have met her, and they have said she is never invited back. My brother always picks similar ladies. Do we speak honestly and risk losing a relationship?","If you and your brother are open w each other and respect each other’s opinions then there is little risk your relationship with him will end.If there already is strong animosity, mistrust, dislike between both of you then there is more chance he will not seriously consider your advice.For your own peace of mind, say whatever you feel must be said to him.The person you’ll need to live with is yourself so do what you believe is needed for you to feel good about saying what’s necessary.Even if he never follows through with your advice then you’ll still know you tried your best to advise.","-of course you speak honestly with the intention of supporting. You could even talk about putting their friendship and his marriage on hold until she really learns how to set boundaries. Studies have shown that it help couples keep their marriages by putting a limit on how much affair couples talk about. With her not being good at social cues it might apply on a family level. You could also encourage him to say something like “Life isn’t a drama” to her, other than being specific. The truth is you are exercising the same action that you’ve seen over and over again. Better not releasing your actions is maintaining the patterns, though it isn’t healthy. You could suggest then that sometimes but not always speaking as how you feel is a healthier approach.  Your feeling you are moving toward taking them out from the family domain, continuing to love them, only listening to what they don't say, not saying what they need all from you- this also not healthy. If you feel you can, challenge that in if thinking at the family level.Reserve an opportunity to even meet with the daughter, talk to both her and her mother, verify the facts and facts that lonely parent might see.It wasn't good how your sister and her partners assumed that if they make her leave the house she leaves the relationship.The assumption that one can't say what is bothering them is like la yi yo!This is describing a sense of powerlessness assuming no one has the right to say something (unless that raised caveat about never being invited is also saying she can never leave).Eds on their different level prioritize why they talked to you, what you she thinks and how well that aligns with discussing relationship Existing concerns with movement in time with say it and making adjustments-Payles (Lisa Gouard Paige Fulton)"
"We’ve been together almost three years. We argue and he ends it by telling me he doesn’t love me. It's hurtful because I am all about resolving the problem, and he dwells on the issue even if I drop what he's done and just swallow my pride and say I am sorry. How can this be resolved? We have kids, and I don't want a broken family because we can't communicate.","You can't fix this by yourself, but I applaud you for trying. One person working hard in a relationship can make things better for a while., but in the long haul you need two people giving some effort. I'm reading between your lines here and I wonder if your need to keep the family together is getting you to apologize when you've done nothing wrong and ignore things you've felt hurt by. I sense that you're doing all the work...that it's not balanced. I have worked with many couples and I've learned never to underestimate what kind of change is possible; anything is possible. But in order for change in a couple to occur, you need two people who are both willing to own their choices and behaviours, and who have empathy. Your boyfriend doesn't appear to have these components; he pushes you away and blames you when he's done something hurtful.Can you be honest with yourself about what's happening? I encourage you to sit down with a trusted friend or therapist and look at what you have here and what your options are. I wish you well.","I think putting help to talk with your husband may help. And I'd encourage your husband to get some help, too. It sounds like communication between two of you has?stalled, and coaches, counselors, and therapists can apply a new perspective and teach you skills that you might find it difficult to develop on your own. It's possible you already have at least one of the skills someone else has. For example, you might have the empathy and good listening skills that he doesn't have or has lost at some point. You?re each probably very good at some things, and experience with a new person in your lives could teach each other useful skills. You could also use this as a way of recognizing the skills you already have with each other. If you're brave enough to attempt things, and your husband is willing to give it a try as well? For instance, Carol S. Dweck, professor at Stanford University, has written a popular book on the Mental Attitudes that Effects behind performance success in the book, Mindset: The New Psychology of Success. She has written about relationships too and how saying something a certain way - Divorce! It was never meant to work, or Because you'd blame me here, against me there...rather than things we both do could get better done - will create power inequalities in the relationship and tend to drive partners apart. Microaggressions such as not listening to the other person, cutting them off? ignoring them? and completing others sentences, are related to what Carol finds can form a continuing pattern, especially on the days when people are tense or tired. She notes relationship partners reflexively repeat microaggression results in people ending up knowing a great deal more about what the other person cares about than they care themselves about.

"What makes my step child, an 8 year old boy, choke my daughter, a 6 year old girl? This has been going on for 4 years. The boy tells my daughter not to tell on him. He knows it's wrong; we have did time out, spanking, taking away toys, and sitting on the wall. I am afraid for my daughters safety!","I can see why you are alarmed. That is a scary situation for a parent. Do you know if the child has been evaluated by a mental health professional? Early treatment is often the key. A professional will be able to help the child learn how to control their anger and mend the troublesome actions into more appropriate responses. Have you addressed your concerns with the child's other parent? There could be contributing factors in his life that could be causing these issues (exposure to violence, sexual/physical abuse, drug use, stressful events in his life, etc.). It is important that these factors are identified so that they can either be eliminated and/or reduced. I wouldn't hesitate to have him evaluated (if he hasn't been already) and to ensure that he is getting the help that he needs whether it be medication and/or therapy. Until then, I would make sure that he is always supervised under an adult's care.","I applaud your patience.  Taking away toys, heat logging (if that is what you meant by “taking away toys”), and sandbox chimes are all serious punishments for a minor, so consider alternatives that are appropriate for all ages in your household. Your daughter`s age should be the determining factor for deducting her use of the toys or whatever the rules are concerning toys. How would you treat an 8 year old who removed a playground structure from a construction site?  How would you treat someone calling them a witch?  Is the punishment reflective of the crime?  If not, then immediate adjustments need to be made.   What, specifically, was the “construction site imagery` and how much was the punishment?  Maybe he was just so excited to be a hero and needs reasonable benchmarks of “good work.”  Tell them they have an 8 year old, not a 3 year old.   If you click your tongue at them or “whisper” to each other, stop it like an adult!  Steptherchildren shouldn`t make things worse.  Excuse him for plate smashing or whatever but your wife or you need to take care of himself.  You are bridging a gap between her and your son.   Who would be his Mom and who would be his dad?  Does he know that he has a wife who is in the basement?  Would she know?   Has your wife known about you?  Is she hidden?  Partnering between spouses to communicate with stepchildren is a must for success.  Also, explain certain aspects of the family unit (as carried out by parents).  She may need to practice hearing you say it to herself at the mirror.  Does he understand why she decides what they can or cannot do?  Is she even supervising?  What is your imprisonment record for “serious assault” of a minor?  What is the ear information about the time givermanship?  Has she sent child protection services to her field?  My grandma now lives with us.  Bad for her, great for her.I see that she does simple kitchen jobs so very naturally and just gets in the habit of doing so.  One of the top benefits of having a stepfamily isn`t controlling each other like parents to child.  It is bringing to house jack in the box and enthusiastic learning.  Develop dates with the ladies to spruce off the dishes.  Eating good food from the cafeteria can be a nice time together.  If she wants to go in and do dishes, suitable for her age, she must take responsibility for her 8 year old son.  Your 6 year old daughter GENIUSALLY knows this.  

Ensure the falls or ground falls review all the right surprise textures chronic sufferers.  Browse Internet sites specifically for fragment-banked notes that say “concrete slopes” or whatever.  Take the time to convulse people as they lean out the window.  Pay attention to what they are saying about their unsure feelings of “enforced neglect.”  If the whole world is made up of my car, does my wife like this?  Try the construction site thingy again with toys.  Maybe adding Rock Hard Discs to those yeses.Get your conversation appropriate with an age-appropriate stepfather.  Never, never, never, communicate with lies to hit at flaws of demeanor.  Stay ""congruent"" in your alternative strategy (suited is age).  Tame your mind.  Go crazy or make jokes about avoiding the step--role play is an opportunity to highlight interests and habits.  Build routines so your children anticipate healthy ways of settling things.  Try paint plays if they forget the steps.  Get a stool so you can sit where they sit.  Try homework sessions to notice decorum.  And conversation observation is life!  Is your wife actually comfortable enough with the boy?   Still drinking black coffee a cup at a time and paying attention to cues about introducing another adult into the room?  Love not leads?  She did not do this easily.  I am not certain if your wife has spoken of you to her step-son.  Then we are winning pieces of a puzzle.  Does your son like visiting?  What is his relationship with the girls?   Does he listen to her?  To whom sticks your side of the bed?  Her old blanket?  Your bedtime room?  Maybe practice at night when the lights out and the parents answer the door.  Let your family do this adventure before the tides become heavy.   Just as you know the mask you put on for the city board and those other men in suits in-between the benches, she must learn how to make the nest of far from bears long enough to cast aside play"
"I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out. 

How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it.  I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy.  What should I do?","While this might not be the first thing you want to discuss when you meet someone, it is important for you to be yourself.  It's better to weed out 10 people who can't accept you to find that one who can.  ","For many people who think they are transgender, the answer lies in affirming themselves: making sure to use the correct gender identification and pronouns as well as seek understanding from friends who care for them. That being said, we still have to accept that those who don't have the same level of understanding surrounding these topics may be insecure or even view being themselves as a threat in their own way, especially in courtship where the hope of marrying or becoming engaged to a person is often present. To know if there is a chance of being understood by his/her potential partner, perhaps what comes naturally to you is talking and hearing a girl's responses, and using your judgment from that. As new terms are evaluated and discussed regarding gender identity and sexuality, I imagine ignoring some aspects of yourself may prevent some of the barriers related to fear of rejection. On a similar note, this knowledge could encourage people who are insecure using internal barriers of fear to create distance, which would help partners feel closer and with a sense of security related to us. If you don't know how to approach someone and share these details related to your gender identity, maybe finding open minded people that talk about these topics may help you clarify how to go about it. It s perhaps possible to avoid a potential lying in a relationship, creating its foundation on plaster, the same as a friend or a relationship that doesn't durate long, which depend of others understanding about what we are.  Good luck!"

People keep telling me I have ""anxiety"" and I'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. This is all new to me. What can I do?","It is ok to have anxiety.   Please don't be anxious about being anxious.If you feel anxiety coming over you, then pull off the road to a safe place.   Concentrate on centering yourself and to breath slowly.   Take some sips of water.  Sit still.     The anxiety should pass in about twenty minutes.If it does not pass, then continue calming yourself until you feel safe enough to drive to your hotel.     You can always explain to your supervisor that you were taking care of a medical problem, because anxiety is a medical problem.","Hi, I am an LCSW (Licensed Clinical Social Worker) in New Jersey. I offer counseling to adults and couples. I also give consulting and workshops within corporations and many churches and non-profits. You worries are quite common including labeling the anxiety you feel in a new situation with the word “anxiety.” Having anxiety, of course, you will not feel “anxiety” per se but other things such as panic energy in the form of shaky knees, a quickening pulse rate and intensified awareness of bodily sensations. Sometimes anxious energy becomes almost unbearable and anxiety is generally understood to mean a feeling of unease or “what if’s” or “how may i potentially fail?” In moments where somatic sensations create the experience of having professional label of anxiety and possibly feared to tailor to a physiological response can helpful to tell yourself but others say you have anxiety, it helps to look for signs of potential stress or anxiety. Experiencing vulnerability, feeling the need to protect yourself, feel concerned or scarytracted, can indicate anxiety and the manifestations can fluctuate from overwhelm, vocalized struggles, worried self-reflections and “worried stare.” We can correctly label anxiety to identify the potential strategies we can use to address anxious frames of perception. Does anxiety you feel feels awful? Yes? No? Practice ""awareness"" within the Now and see if you are ready to explore and possibly change stimuli associated with anxiety."
"I have been noticing myself really enjoying watching/reading about gay or lesbian couples. I've also been imagining what it might be like to date a girl, and I like the idea. I also find guys cute too. Does this make me bisexual?",Hello!  Thank you for your question.  Exploring your sexual orientation and attraction is a wonderful opportunity to get to know yourself!  I would be curious to know what feelings you might have related to the possibility of being bi; What messages you may have received related to this orientation and any concerns you have about possible sexual orientations.,"Sure, yours is a bit of a life cycle.Alaska Farie, PhD, Marriage & Family Therapy Licenced Psychologist.Basically, you may have first thought that you were straight, and men are cute, and you can see yourself dreaming about heterosexual sex, but you also go and read/ward about same gender dating and think ""Guess I like it, from time to time"".  That may be enough to say you are bisexual.   Being more and more feminist, which I encourage, and being more about aligning gender identity, you are opening your mind to the omnipresent genre of intimacy.Basically I get this a lot from my clients with denial that they are not straight.  To aim at climbing a mountain of self- worth and handling the gods that have set that rock in place, you block out any direction that does harm to your own self- esteem and self-worth.Iowa Review of Multicultural Family Therapy, Vol 1 No 3,1990.See what I wrote about rejection anxiety.See also lie receiving pride!Pride is the oasis of care, support, and love for many queer folks.So don't see yourself as similar to every type of queer person.Basically they may help to trigger out their relationship fear, but nobody is your mirror.Good luck!"
"I've tried working out and eating fruits and vegetables, but I always seem to eat the junk in the house.","I know some people do better when they don't have as much junk food in the house. This is not as tempting then. Having said that, maybe you can reward yourself with different things, such as having dessert on certain days. If you are concerned about mostly eating habits, consider seeing a nutritionist. They can help you find the balance between what it is that you really want and your goals. I'm not sure how this links to happiness for you, but hopefully looking at your choices can lead you toward your goal of being healthier.","I can understand how it could get annoying to feel like you're trying very hard to change your habits, but not seeing the results you want. Sure enough, it can be tough to change bad habits, especially when they're so simple like reaching for a bag of chips instead of drinking a glass of water. However, even though it often does feel that the new better habit didn't really change your behavior, it's probably doing so!   Why? Because you're starting to think in a different way than when you didn't change your habit. Even if you're chewing chips, you're still making the conscious decision to reach for them. Unless you replace the chips with something you don't like (e.g. like dental floss) you're still picking the same chips in spite of your maybe not-wanting-to-do-it feeling.. Once you delete the chips from the house and trade them for a healthier snack, there is little reason to pick one again and this easily can become a new habit that doesn't need conscious delivery! Sometimes the smallest habit in really, real tough behaviors change lol The truth of the matter is that it does take time to replace an old habit with a new one because the brain needs to rewire itself for the new action. This changes how we think and this is based on small conscious actions that turn into automatic actions with frequent repetition and consistency.`"
I feel really uncomfortable when I have people's attention.  It makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class. Can I get over this social anxiety?,"you can learn lots of skills/techniques to feel more confident in what you need to do that will decrease your anxious response for sure! :) And  you can also learn how to work with your personality that may not like the attention. You may find that ""talking"" to others through the internet is more comfortable and you are great at it, or that you love one on one talking but aren't really made for group talking. There is a place in this world for you either way! Public speaking skills can be practiced in speech class, or toastmaster group, they will give you practice in a safe environment where the cool kids or cutest boy aren't ready to laugh at you.  What topics are you interested in and what groups can you do a little speaking up? Maybe in your small group at church try and raise you hand to share your opinion, or maybe your Girl Scout troop? Look around for a peer and one adult who you like to hear speak out, ask them to share with you 2 things that help them feel comfortable speaking in public. Check out some Ted Talks and see how they share in groups. Social anxiety is a difficult concern and picking apart what is your awesome personality and what needs skill building and mindfulness/anxiety  help are important steps. Good luck!",": Yes you can learn to manage and cope with your social anxiety!Starting your 1on1 coaching is a great first step.  Social anxiety can be due to shame or feelings of inadequacy, whether these are accurate or not.  A coach can help provide support as you learn new tools and strategies that will help you and build confidence at receiving attention or at speaking.  Mindfulness and Self-Compassion tools can also help move through shame fulfilling evidence to objectively see your true worth and who you really are!  Also helpful is to keep in mind many people can identify with your feelings of social anxiety, not just you.  You don’t have to have social anxiety YOU want to overcome, there is a place of skill-building and social learning that can help you develop new behaviors and habits.  As you try new tools it'll get more natural growing and living especially as you begin to enjoy or even crave the social attention or experience in class, thank you for reading and I wish you all the success in your social anxiety challenge! :)"

I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?,It is absolutely a typical response.  Many of my clients are nervous the first couple of times we meet.  This is essentially a stranger with whom you are sharing your feelings.,"I am a physical therapist, not a psychologist. However, I wish I could offer you some peace of mind. First do you mean to say that the shaking or nitrus is not occurring in other parts of your life? You say the symptoms occur during therapy sessions. Are therapy sessions fast paced? Are you usually the communicator during sessions? Are you talking about a relationship or a general stress/Achievement problem?Seeking therapy is a sign of good desire to resolve your situation. You have made a big honest step. Then again, if nothing has changed or you feel the therapeutic relationship she and you have is not working, it may be worth giving another therapist a try as we only find people that are our match at times, and therapy therapist is no exception. In addition consider essentially sitting there for awhile and being mindful of the experience. Try taking your attention before the session to notice particular physical sensations around the body and places where your botherous unwanted emotion is more apparent. This exercise makes observers of the emotions more vivid and present. Eventually this may help you be more open and ready to utilize suggestion receptors of change skills discussed with a therapist."
"I can't even smile or fake one. I can't feel happiness about anything and I can't show love towards another person not even my girlfriend. I hate myself sometimes. All I see is ugly.
   I can't get over the loss of a loved one and I'm not close to my family. What can I do?","Trust and believe your own feelings.Emotions are real and reflect how someone feels about a situation.Since you're sad about losing a loved one, be patient w your feelings about this.  Basically, be guided by how you feel and eventually you will feel different emotions which I hope will be happier ones.","The loss of a loved one is a powerful emotional event. It changes the lives of the people close to us in profound ways.When we grieve, we suffer loss. Loss takes many forms: grieving takes on many expressions. In your situation, grief most likely has manifested itself as depression (sadness, loss of interest, withholding emotions and inability to connect with others). I'd encourage you to consult with a qualified counselor who is capable of diagnosing and possibly treating your depression. Although I recommend therapy, I also have to suggest, by analogy, that if you are serious about healing, you address the deepest part of your sadness and isolation. By working through the sadness, you may also be able to address your difficulties with your girlfriend.Once you heal from this deep grief and you become better equipped to love and feel to flourish as a person with relationships, I'm sure that you therefore will increase your confidence to finally embrace yourself. Adjusting Negative Beliefs about OneselfAfter thoroughly feeling and working through the underlying grief and sadness that caused your depression of lack of connections, perhaps awareness will arise. A reflection may posit: This is probably because I loathe and don't feel worthy of ...tell yourself a few more times the opposite: I can't get over losing someone. I can't quite close my eyes on his/her memory, but it is a lovely memory. This message tells a lie....so how will you recognize this? Would you like other people to behave like your loved one did being loving/giving? They are not negative employees, but a few flaws you can't bend over backwards for. Perhaps you are celebrating yourself. Of course you're not there anymore, but listening to your inner dialogues and validating self-suffering contexts will surely trigger: ""I am allowed to feel wrong parts of me :( "" Its normal when we grieve that we would be in treatment (think of your grief as emotional turbulence). Don't shy from it, harness it. It soothes emotional damage and prepares us to make an entry-self appraisal on how we've been dealing with things... Place your love and failure in your overall pattern of ""I am allowed to keep re-evaluating whether I am a problematic person,"" ""I do not have a pulse, my loved one was not communicating with me properly either,"" or more dramatically, ""I can't get over grieving, and there is no such thing as iaddiction to ever finding happiness (self-isolation) or being agreeable.""

"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","From your initial description, I would say that your mother is ""Maloriented"". In this stage of Alzheimer's individuals tend to be blaming and difficult to deal with. They may often hide or throw things away and then blame family members for this. In addition, if they are incontinent, they may blame a leaky roof or something else when they are wet. You are correct that this is not her fault, but often for family members this does not make it any easier for you to cope. I strongly suggest that you learn communication strategies that will help you to communicate with your mother in a way that lets her work through the difficulties associated with the disease. I always suggest Validation techniques to family members.In addition, you need to give yourself some kind attention and take time out from your circumstances as needed. You need to be able to center yourself and come to acceptance that this is your mother's illness that is the problem, not her and certainly not you.","Natural progression of the disease is causing unpredictability of the disease course, with worsened dementia, active psychotic symptoms and changes in behavior such as demanding unrealistic or meaningless items. Generally the focus is on caring and asking whether your mother knows that the item was taken or was sarcastic or complimentary. I suggest cogniton behavior therapy with a psychotherapist who specializes in dementia. Ask the psychotherapist about caregiver interventions. Attempt to set predictable, consistent responses such as “I know the answering machine number. I can call your brother to message you.” Frequently repeat to prevent escalation. The key skill here is to remain challenging yet caring to support the dignity of your mother. How are you coping?Are you depressed, have anxiety, forget things, embarrassed? The way you feel is showing you that accepting this and bond with the person you love and believe she is her own person helping her to move through the stages and not feeling guilty. Candidate for family confidant. Your emotional health is just as important if not more than the physical and hygienic the worry of the exotic and unrealistic demands. Additionally keep records and come up with fun ways to talk to your mom or person with dementia.

"I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it.
 I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call.
 I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive. I know what I'm doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change. How do I stop this behavior and thought process?","Good for you on your keen awareness of your difficulties and your willingness to change!The type of change you'd like to achieve is possible, and since a change in self-confidence and self-love is deep rooted, this comes about gradually and slowly.Keep understanding yourself during your moments of doubt and anxiety.  Its fine to feel terrible and certainly better to know you feel insecure than to act upon the insecurity by being with men who take advantage of you.Everyone needs to feel loved and recognized.Until you attract a partner who will love and appreciate you, develop relationships with co-workers and classmates, neighbors, so that you have some quality of giving and being given by someone.It is a way to nurture yourself and another person until your strength and self-belief grow bigger.","Congratulations on making the decision to begin a beautiful, strong relationship. It seems like you're ready to break your pattern of self-blighing instead of holding responsibility for your actions. Are there any specific thoughts you think trigger this whole pattern? It might be starting to notice them and then challenging them to be realistic and factual. Then maybe mood tracking for a week could help you notice what people say or do that might trigger your standard abortion strings? Knowing that will let you respond differently next time."
"I was with my friends fishing by a pond. I found a frog and stabbed it with my friend's knife. I'm not sure why I did it. My friends saw me do it it and were shocked and got really mad at me.

Now if someone brings it up I get really upset and panicked. I don't know why I feel like this. Does this mean there is something wrong with me?","The good news is your awareness that being violent to animals feels out of character for you.   I'm glad you have awareness and I'm glad you are not at ease with killing frogs.Fairly likely that you were acting out aggressively toward the frog, feelings of being on the receiving side of similar type of violence.Basically, you did unto the frog what someone has or to you, feels like, has been done to you.Use your surprising finding of how strong your anger and most likely inward pain.   Reflect on your closest relationships and how these people treat you.   It is possible you feel more hurt by someone who is close to you than you ever realized.Stabbing innocent frogs is wrong.  It is understandable as a way to show you how much inner pain you probably have.It is also wrong that someone close to you hurt you.The direction to go is to recognize your pain and then decide how to go about changing what is possible on your side of that or those relationship(s).","You're definitely not the only one that has thought about the morality of killing a frog.I have told some of my clients that one sort of look at why we kill animals when we can help them that we try to make ourselves into the dominant species, and that there is a very dominant instinct in all of us and in all of our souls, that insists that we eliminate other competitors.We don't have to eliminate them of where it has truly gone concerned and what we can do to help them, but the instinct presses on.In the universe of human childhood emotions, the story that wants us to kill the worthy frog is a mid-length story. It doesn't have the dramatic rambles and explosions that some others stories have, but it's a fairly enduring one.In fact, there are short stories to explain why we hypnotically go for the suffering frog. We wish the guilt drama we feel in our fee-less in stories have time to be finished by directly harming the frog who brings forgiveness where we thought it was buried. If you're interesting in some variations and completion with your farm corpse, consider getting a therapist who does these ""moral integration exercises."""
"I’m a man, and I’m soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but it’s been happening a lot. I don't know what to do.","Hello, and thank you for your question. When faced with these kinds of difficult challenges, I usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be. Indeed, it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we don't feel very content with our lives. Perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions: What kind of person do I want to be deep in my heart? What kind of character do I want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching? How would I want others to describe me? Let's say that you want others to see you as being authentic, and YOU also value authenticity as something you want to live by. You may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now. That you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart. This is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation. So please, try not to feel alone. We all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc. And I am not just talking about being unaccepted by others, but a person may have a VERY hard time accepting themselves. Thinking about your values and living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom, but I won't lie, it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time. For example, someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for, even if that means people may disapprove. That may cause a lot of pain, but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity. It may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy, which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them. I would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are... both as an individual and as someone's fiancé.Above all, I wish you well in this journey. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC","The question is not whether you are acting inappropriately, I am not for this, or that you are cheating. The question is what is people your values, what is most integral to you, whereby you are allowing yourself an escape to experience and accept men, who immediately offer, like those you have been around, the “passions” you have been yearning for? Is it the fact that you want to be, in addition to being a man, a sex addict? Is it denial of the fact that you have a sexually arousing relationship with your future wife? Is it a denial that once you sit with your future wife, the moments of happiness seem distant? Loneliness? The fact you are curious about men? Making compromises either with your future wife, about one ditching her, or just eliminating perissions and investigating how you feel about this? What are the rules for the relationship?"
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",Absolutely not.  I strongly recommending working on one issue/need at a time.  In therapy you will set smart goals and objectives that will help you reach your goals.  I see you as a survivor and not a victim.  Best wishes to you.,"It sounds like you qualify for a lot of things! Can you imagine you have a whole jug of coaching questions focusing on your confidence, raising your income, improving time management and organization, or developing new strategies to cope with low mood or anxiety? All of the interruptions you've had so far and that you're currently going through aren't a bad thing, instead they offer the best timing to talk about things, to heal wounds and becoming whole again. Even if you talk only about one of your problems that might help too. As to the management of multiple issues in therapy isn't generally recommended, not because one can't talk about 2+ things (it's not impossible of course) but because focus is very helpful to each route and you get more speech at a faster pace. Have a conversation with your therapist about how you'd like to start sessions focusing on your topics. Some therapists will do either chakram lap together or maybe schedule twice a month or do intensive group coaching on one of your issues. Each will fit your preference and therapy AB meetings here within ABA can discuss more."
"I have three siblings. My mom loves them and not me. She’s always yelling at me, but when it comes to my siblings, she talks to them. I’m always crying in my room.","Have you ever tried talking with her about this when she's not angry? While I hear you saying that it feels like she doesn't love you, there could be a lot of other pieces to this. Have you ever told her about how much she means to you (when she's not angry)?","I think Dear MomNachs is giving you fair credit to recognize this pattern. Sickness of the psychological organism, unlike the infection caused by a pathogen, can only be cured by recognizing the pattern and displaying courage to break out of it.In your case the watering hole for the organism is the mother figure and the stimuli is the anger from her and the loathing (on her part) triggered by seeing and hearing your siblings acting the way she likes.Flip it. Be the watering hole to her and the stimuli would become the different pattern of love that you perceive for her. And to notice how this is different to the loathing she shows towards yourself while you sit on her rocks and feel bad and a total failure even ashamed. I really believe within the space you are creating yourself, your mom will at some point, feel the shift brought about by the having a different way of being and reacting to her. And with time and practice would start to exhibit this new recognization.A useful approach could be to take some inventory of what you appreciate about her and what you offer to her that she would benefit. It could be not even related to what she likes for her to have in her fridge. She groans out you've been afraid abseats it every part of myself. But we were both born as childlike parts of ourselves expressing an adolescent like functionality. A childwoman with imaginary relationships and yet it exists in what she had as a teenager. Which has turned into you. So what would an imaginary mother for you as a child be able to provide? The opportunity to fulfill her inner driven perspective for no consideration to whether what you're trying is doing for her or not. And suddenly you have the space that lives separately from the feelings in her face.Is this something you would dare to try?"
"I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I can't afford to live alone.
   My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules. She is trying to control my life. What should I do?","That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now. The first thing to under is that you can’t change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior. The thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions.  You may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan. The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior. Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy. Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack.  There are ways you can deal with controlling parents – and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you’ll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they’re trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you’re losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust. There aren’t any quick tips on how to deal with parents who want to control you; you need to find strategies that are geared to your specific family situation. Get specific coping tips from books about family dynamics, such as:Toxic Parents: Overcoming Their Hurtful Legacy and Reclaiming Your Life by Susan ForwardCutting Loose: An Adult's Guide to Coming to Terms with Your Parents by Howard HalpernA counselor can be a good resource and provide support and guidance about issues addressing normal growth and development during periods of transition.","There is a lot to gain by learning to set nice and fair limits so that your parents can accept and appreciate the changes that come as growing up.Deciding who is going to set the house rules and negotiating with one another when agreements aren't keeping everyone happy might help each of you use your words to solve problems rather than blaming one another or leaving each other alone for days at a time because of arguments.Non-financial things like changing the way you dress or whom you associate with can feel very personal, but sometimes the arguments we have about such things reflect bigger issues, such as feeling frustrated at the lack of freedom I must be allowed to experience.No rules declaring that the house can no longer be called a home beats a few wins in fairness. Good argument skills are especially helpful when you have to maintain good relationships while intervening in situations involving family, such as establishing your own time in the house, negotiating your own finances with the parents you still look up to and reshaping bedtimes and other house rules that may feel like oversteps.Stop blaming or running away and determine ways for resolution and for a fair relationship."
"I keep getting into relationships with men that are in bad situations. I take them on and help them and do all I can and the relationship still fails. How do I learn to not get in relationships with men in bad situations? I see someone in need of help, I jump in. And it is getting me nowhere. I am alone sad and frustrated.","Sounds like you already see what's amiss. You're looking for fix-er-uppers! When you meet these men they need you. And you're filled by fixing them.  And when they are fixed, what do they have to give you? What's your need in relationship? What if you found someone who didn't need fixing? ","First, I'm very impressed with your desire to help people and your willingness to do all you can to succeed in your relationships. This person is a man in a bad situation who is just incredibly appealing and attracts you. The threshold of distress and concern is probably too high before you can begin to address the problems. You may find yourself removing yourself when it's an easier solution. Have you thought about why a man in a bad situation is so appealing? You are young and lonely, realizing that you can help. Recruiting a partner is just one person and it doesn't change your old symptoms of loneliness and persisting belief of being alone. We first address those here - what are your actual relationships and social network like and what social network would you like to be a part of? We also talk through the making of a core narrative - why you new the chilly answers - as well as ways in which you view men as partners. Being considered for a role as caregiver is sometimes called 911 - or needing ""suicide hotlines."" In relationships, we are all 911 operators for each other. As the counselor, I'm often hypnotized to go into “911 mode” and certain behavior patterns start up, often in the caretaker role, that end up giving more support to abused partners or ""nurses"" and neglecting self shown self-care. As long as 911 is never called - the trigger and advice is hidden from the ""double image,"" often called ""shadow parts,"" of our identity. They're the part that says ""this is how I live my life."" The shadow lives below our conscious awareness. This is not about feeling guilt or shame or just admitting something UNACCEPTABLE about the self. Shadow work is o FICULA and you can only deal with it when it's on the ""stage of consciousness."" This means we need to bring it up into our motivation/intent. Shadow parts usually get us into relationships by ""suggesting"" romantic options, ""help me how to date right."" These are the triggers we use to bring the shadow onto the ""stage.""  Since you mentioned a preference for men already in difficult situations, out of your core narrative (about why you developed the skill of being a caretaker), we can ask whether men in bad situations are trans personalities. Advanced CBT techniques suitable for teens are included in core counseling. Shadow is a narrow aging of ego, and deep work with deep work tools, such as analytical meditation, are needed to disintegrate the shadow parts which is why they persist in the first place. If we are not able to integrate the ""shadow parts,"" the older issues that inform the attachment narrative, then we are advil-in, in hot liquid in which we dissolve as we practice AGAIN and AGAIN, which is what often occurs in couples that I see. ""We do something, and we hurt each other,"" ""We support each other,"" rapidly spirals down into 911 mode, etc. Full shadow work must also be practiced for this ""who am I?"" struggle to stop being seriously wounded by this. It's scary to go to the center of ourselves, have things we fear be out in the open, and confront us - we interfere with the ego in order to rebalance central schema."" meditation such as body scanning is required at this place to understand why we need so much caretaker activity, our attachment styles, etc. This is the real self-work.""

"My wife and mother are having tense disagreements. In the past, they’ve had minor differences. For example, my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing; my mother would complain my wife is lazy.

What can I do?","One choice is for you and your wife to decide together what are reasonable ways and expectations to have of your mother.From what you write it sounds like your wife and you have differences as to what is the proper and right way to talk with your mother.Once the both of you agree on overall philosophy and some specific details for examples, then ask your mother to make time for all three of you to discuss together the expectations and standards you and your wife would like to see happen.This is only the first step since it is possible and likely that at least on a few points, your mother will disagree and have different views.These need to be discussed and integrated into an overall plan which all three of you are happy to live with.","to say immediately is to comfort each of them in their own manner, but since you are close to both, it may be best to follow the ""Ready, Set, Go!"" paper snowflake feelings program which I have over 180 programs for each family member and 70 for couples.

"I can't seem to feel any emotion except anxiety, not even for myself.","Empathy is the ability
to tap into our own experience to help us connect with others in order to be
aware of how they are experiencing life. 
It is a skill that we learn with practice and refine as we become mature.
If you are feeling anxious, maybe you are able to understand better others who
are going trough anxiety.  But I wonder
if instead of feeling empathy, you may just want to find ways to reduce your
anxiety.  A good idea is to be very aware
of your anxiety triggers, and once you identify them explore other ways you
could react. ¿Sera normal que no sienta empatía?Parece que no puedo experimentar ninguna otra emoción que

destreza interpersonal que aprendemos y refinamos con la práctica y según maduramos
como personas.  Si te estás sintiendo

de ansiedad.  Pero me pregunto si en
lugar de estar buscando sentir empatía, realmente quisieras reducir tus niveles
de ansiedad.  Una buena manera es estar consciente

pudieras tener.","Emotions are complex and how we experience them can depend on a variety of factors, including etiology for the anxiety.  Are you anxious due to a fear something?  If so, it would be helpful to focus on that fear or imagine the situation for it.  If not, then probably not that helpful for you.  Emotions are felt there because it all lives in the brain and uses neurotransmitters, chemicals that transmit signals to your brain, that allow you to inner experience to happen.  If biker (or certain situations or circumstances) interfere with these chemicals or brain regions, then maybe you're not able to connect to emotions.  You sexual assault survivor, for sure.  There are some treatments available for sexual assault survivors that actually help.  Use awareness breathing techniques that I talk about about and see a therapist that specializes with people that have experienced trauma and explain your situation to her or him."
"Sometimes, I'm fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth. I've always thought it was normal and I was just nervous, but the other day, it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter Target by myself.","I would suggest keeping a log of those days when you are having a hard time. Items to write would be what were you doing before you felt this way, did you eat and what, what time of day is it, how much sleep did you get that night, etc... This can help you identify any triggers. Further assessment can be made by a health care professional. It does sound like you are experiencing some symptoms of anxiety.","I can understand why this experience was anxiety-provoking for you. It sounds like because of your anxiety there can be intense feelings of panic and shame when you are in a situation where you have to confront your therapist. In times where you have specific symptoms or reactions, and worries about those symptoms or reactions, . have a lot been helpful in my practice, I would you to try this: studying your unsettling experience, first through body focus, looking at how your heart might spike, your legs feeling maybe anchored to the floor.ache to breathe. Attuning to physical sensations and building a sense of safety. The next step, of course, would be talking about that time you had to enter the store. If you prefer to talk over the phone then this is a great opportunity for you to try and blend the body awareness method I have described and speaking about your experience. This should help to tackle both the pervasive symptoms and also10 the immense shame that is built up around those symptoms and behaviors. One thing that can sometimes help with this style of anxiety is to pair it with relaxationTraining or breathing by meditation, guided imagery, deep breathing or hugging various parts of your body.If you would like in deficit support in these practices then I invite you to reach out and book an appointment.  There are also ways that your discomfort could be more than natural as fear of abandonment, or discontentment in our life overall.

I invite you to reach out to see what diving deeper can uncover to you and how to actively participate in your personal healing deficit to adjust how you encounter situations where you feel stuck up. You sound very reflective and it also tells me that you are decisive to working with the profound mirror of your inner self. That will be rewarding, and it will also require some bold exploring of the parts which tell you that you are unable to ""cope"".When you are in a safe space for these kinds of explorations you are going to be surprised at how proud and satisfied you'll be when you succeed at doing what scares you.

"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","It is challenging to see one's parents age and to cope with the new demands.  Your mom means a lot to you, and that is why you get easily frustrated.  I'm guessing that it is not that she is making you do work or that her expectations are non-important to you because if that were the case, you would not feel any guilt.  Accepting the new stage will help you cope with the changes.  Take a deep breath every time you feel frustrated and think of the good times you shared with your mom before her getting Alzheimer's.  Remember that your mom as she was is no longer and that she has reverted to a more delicate phase.  Also, schedule time for yourself and do things that help you relax.  Caretaking of an elderly parent can take a toll on you, and it is essential to incorporate self-care.  Finally, look for an Alzheimer's support group in your area that will help you connect with other people going through the same thing.  You are a good daughter, and your mom is lucky to have you in her life.Sincerely, Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling","Pleasing your mother and relieving your guilt are both taking a lot of your energy to sustain. Take care of yourself first, accepting that you are not responsible for your mother. Depression and anxiety commonly affect those of those dealing with stupid memories and falls. Take necessary caregiving, educational and support classes, for yourself too. Do not leave caregiving to your mother! A random Suzanne, California, has blogged about any Alzheimer's behaviors I might face. I thought I understood my mom's moods and moods by herself before suffering some of these similar things. The afternoon of taking tours of care homes for Alzheimer's, I quarrelled with Suzanne's mom.

"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",You can be helped. Many of the people I see have multiple issues. These issues are often linked so that helping one issue will positively help the other issues.,"It seems that your existing marriage relationship, which has lasted for 35 years, functions in this clinic as a “stability buffer.” Much as it’s good to have a senior official or trusted colleague to turn to in the course of work, it’s similarly good to have a “buffer” in the form of an and dependable relationship. Excessive instability in one’s relationships and networks can easily threaten overall mental health and well-being. The common feeling of being low in self-confidence, and your possible anxiety, may provide a natural indication that you would like a “strengthary” boost to yourself that satisfies part of what your marriage relationship has served as: a source of protection against instability in your life and emotions. Your therapist and you must learn together what is best for making sure you functional at an optimal state, assuming this is your goal. Your practice of “yielding” these “issues” indicates that you allow people to be the “drivers” of any areas of interest and discovery in your therapeutic treatment. In limiting your own power within these rooms, you have successfully shielded yourself from the particular risk inherent in pursuing these issues. The very act of confronting these issues, especially after long periods of avoidance, can be “traumatic” in the sense that it involves uncovering expectations and disappointments in life that was already stressful in different ways. The fact that you say you have a complaint of “sleep” and yet your marriage, as its natural high has been a “buffer,” makes it sound as though the sleep is far less painfully hurt than facing any other aspect that requires you to “balance the relationship to make it last.” I can see how thinking of your marriage as a strong & safe thing will make it difficult to challenge the peace you get as a result of staying with it if you have more balanced expectations that it is too fragile to be understood or appreciate all aspects of it.  Therapists in talk therapy ask especially important questions to challenge others as far as the realistic nature of their expectations and would be particularly helpful in thinking through questions about your expectations in your marriage. As a first step in clarifying what is the actual “fragility” that you may feel not to be able to handle within yourself, you might imagine your marriage relationship on a graph: your body and mind are in & out of the parallelogram (named Stability Buffer by your “Therapist”), which graphically represents a boundary, a protective layer around you. Your therapist might suggest, “Let’s draw this together, face-to-face, in therapy. Your body will be on the outside of the boundary and your mind for the inside.” Maintaining a healthy conversation with yourself about the partnership involves negotiating boundaries in your mind about which components are lawyers of the suppression case against yourself for not trusting yourself, reminds you that you’ve survived a betrayal from a guy and other things such as cancer. The Telearian means taking communication, the analogue of one‑on‑one talk therapy with a therapist, over some sort of technology — video & audio communications. The abilities used in the Telearian employ meanings via channels of images and voices in time. Interviewing oneself in the form of a Telearian might mean recording a talk with the therapist about your history and take back the recording to play after subsequent sessions and noting your behaviors.

"I'm scared that I am with this man so I won't be alone. He should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case, and I don’t want to hurt him.","While not wanting to be alone may not be the best reason to be in a relationship, it is probably more common and normal a reason than you think.  Since you seem to care about your friend (""don't want to hurt him""), I imagine there are many other reasons that you are together.  I suggest that you talk about this open-heartedly with each other.  The idea of being afraid of being alone sounds like an honest starting place.  Don't try to ""figure out"" whether you should be with him.  Just talk.  The communication is likely to shine light on deepening connection for BOTH OF YOU.In the meantime, your idea that you don't deserve him is rooted in a ""core lie"" that you are telling yourself.  You can read about ""core lies"" and much more in my book, Living Yes, a Handbook for Being Human.  Check out www.LivingYes.org.Be easy on yourself.  You are deserving!~Mark","I can imagine that you're in a difficult place right now, and you probably feel very stuck.  First, what might this partnership be giving you at this point in your life?    It could be helpful to get clear on what else you give to this relationship, expectations, expectations that aren't being met, and separation consequences.In addition to examining the relationship itself, it may be useful to talk to a clinical psychiatrist so that we can walk together through this desire of yours to get out of this relationship, and how you're feeling about doing that.I mean I can only offer a small number of dictionary words here (trauma, codependence, boundaries, autonomy).  I suspect they aren't too helpful in your situation.  You really deserve to be with someone who loves and cares about you, and that person can be anyone.  If this doesn't help, you likely do need to meet with a professional therapist in the area.  And if stress, feeding, drinking or sleeping are issues because when you're working through this relationship(s) and all that comes up with it, that may be a competitive circumstance it can take a good amount of work (time and effort) to overcome those.  I'd encourage you to pursue relationship ending coaching (maybe with this type of exposure therapy based approach to uproot the lasting fear and trauma impacts of leaving that more likely began in childhood through to early past relationships) at least as a last resort, like you put care about the person.  But in terms of finding a better relationship, are there things you can access to support a new ending?  Are you able to pool things together that do your personal safety feel?  Are you able to think of things you want from a partner?  What kind of person or behaviors are a dealbreaker?  Is it possible to have these conversations if you decide this is the correct thing to do?  What are the parts of the partnership that you confide in this type of stuff?  Work on these things and there needs practice outside your relationship also.  What would your relationship ideal feel like?  Try to be in a different area so you're able to regulated and bring away some distance.  I think on my part then I would know what it feels like to be at a healthier distance in a female companionship relationship.  I also suspect that you need to be okay with what you have inside this relationship.  Are you being dishonest?  Are you using foodation and soothing with this relationship?  I think you made a great choice to begin assessing yourself in terms of these locus of previous offspring Experiences with others.  Patients who, for example, Leeds easily fall for partners, have quite often (no surprise) had cheerleaders in the primary caregiver role in their child-hood.  Which may mean that they feel ease being visible about themselves because there are already people in their life that accept them always needing to be offered More . Likewise, they'd panicked if suddenly the partner someone jumped in and went to work on the personures and passionate warmth more so than that.  Play a bit with the energies of your own and your partnership, slowly gradually, build scents for yourself and separate beings, find out about separation comforting resources.  With practice derivatives [impacts and residuals] take time, \moments in spaces where actions alter most significantly occurring breath differences."
"I've known him for about six years. We've dated off and on. I hadn't seen him in close to three years but recently started seeing him again. I really want this to last this time. I stayed the night. Do I text, call, or make contact first, the same day of the morning I left his house?","It is possible your question reflects some insecurity about whether or not either or you would like this relationship to continue.Otherwise, the answer to your question would appear naturally.  If you genuinely feel close enough to this person to sleep with him, then who texts whom first, wouldn't really matter too much.Try to understand within yourself whether you feel truly interested in this person as much as you would like to feel toward someone.","Consider how he reacted after his visit and the night away.  Did he text you extra often or early in the morning?  Did he receive and answer all your messages?  If you have nothing of consumption use to get yourself together before you can get in touch with him, that is acceptable as it will maintain your dignity when reaching out, turn on your phone, turn on your radio, or lunch out, so that upon checking you still hear how you took care of yourself so you can be proud to yourself of how you dealt with the situation.  It will also give you more of your personal responsibility in the situation.  Also, a 24 (or a 48) hour longer break for your own enjoyment or rest, or opportunity to connect with other people might make a visit stronger on your own time if you accepted an invitation.  Then when you are in see if he is there, he will test to see if you will make yourself oneself. :)  Marshall B. Rosenberg discusses this with some tales from his life.  I write an episode on his podcast,  https://mindbodygreen.com/p/angel-newman-2EGQT8wmnAj_EA71Vr6nWw/blog, where Vernon explains that like you, the REP, considers writing to the person he loves, but waits longer than a day as thay to think how a post will affect himself more than a relationship with someone, like You."
"I keep having these random thoughts that I don't want. Things like ""you aren't worth anything."" I know they're my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it.
   What is wrong with me, and how can I stop having these thoughts?","Many people have thoughts like those you describe, and often it feels like someone else is saying it because they are things that may have been said to you when you were very young.  When young children hear negative things about themselves they tend to internalize these negative ideas and to form negative core beliefs.  The good news is we can learn to stop these thoughts and to replace them with healthier thoughts.  The first step is to catch yourself when you are thinking these thoughts, and to stay ""stop!""; then replace it with another thought.  So for instance, maybe you fail a test or get rejected by a romantic interest.  You catch yourself saying ""you aren't worth anything"". Stop this thought, and replace it with ""You didn't do as well on that test as you would have liked.  Let's figure out how you can do better next time.""  Or ""she may not want to go out with you, but someone else will"". So the idea is to develop a voice of a ""friend"", who can tell you the kind of things you would say to your own best friend.  You might also pick up the book, Feeling Good, by David Burns. He gives many tips for how to change Negative Self Talk.","It suggests one of two possible conditions. First, that there's some form of depression, which feeds on words and feeds a core feeling. The second would be that there's some disordered thinking involved, perhaps, telling you you're ""worth nothing"" and feeding that. In either case, frankly, I think that therapy will help get to the bottom of this. Best of luck to you."
"I'm a guy. If I don't like girls, nor do I like guys, does that mean I'm gay?","Hi, and thanks for your question. I agree with my colleagues about researching asexuality, but I want too add a couple of things about that:Here is a website that you can start with to get some information about asexuality - http://www.asexuality.org/home/There are a whole lot of myths surrounding asexuality. One is that people who are asexual have absolutely no interest in sex, and that is not always the case. There are variations of asexuality. Some people who are asexual have an interest in sex and others don't. Also, once you read more on this topic, you may find that you don't connect with asexuality either, and that is okay. Our society usually thinks of sexual orientations as only being straight, gay, lesbian, or bisexual, but the truth is there are many variations of sexual orientations. Keep exploring. There is a good chance that there is a community of people who feel like you do. Finally, labels are important for a lot of things, but labeling ourselves can sometimes lead to some painful feelings. Try not to feel pressured to label yourself too quickly. This is your journey. Your experience. Take all the time you need. You may never feel the need to label how you feel, and that is okay, too. Hope this helps. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC  ","In the end, it's your own decision how gay, or queer, or whatever term you wish to go with, as you identify. I would say it's very unlikely that you would like to be in a relationship with anybody other than your own gender (i.e., male). However, even if you are only interested in same gender relationships, being gay simply means 'gays as you and as a trend' and it's the label that applies to you. If worn properly, it is a symbol neither negative nor positive; rather, the same as the letters your name contains ['g', 'o', 't', 'h', 'b', 'r', 'g', 'r', 'e', 'g', 'a', 'i', 'n', 'g']. If you don't like, you're not going to like its meaning. However, as part of your recommendation, I suggest that you research (in fact, lots of research is available online) the difference between being queer, gay, or homosexual. I didn't find such a difference five to seven nights ago, when my own gender preference was the question. For me, it was in a local free clinic/group where men gather to speak of hunger pains and God love (""I'm not gay"")) and the talk was all about different people having different needs, including being different. So, believe me. It's okay if it's neither one thing or the other.

"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years. I have been on medication, but lately my depression has felt worse. Can counseling help?","Thank you for asking this important question. I find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment. Step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change. Congratulations you did the first step! You are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question. Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression. The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with  Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events. Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression.  The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment. As counselors, we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time. However, remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well being. I hope this was helpful, and good luck with your treatment journey. ",": Of course! I think what may help is re-framing the time period in question. Rather than saying the course of your depression has fatigued and gotten worse, simply look backward from the conclusion of your actual medication course. It sounds like just the fact that you were able to neutralize previously chronic, painful symptoms of depression and anxiety was really a sign that your medication was doing its job. So the closer you are to the ""end date"" of this medication, the more likely you are to feel the symptoms returning, or even feeling more depressed than you did at the beginning of this medication. An approach for your next counseling session could be replacing this internal chart of the remaining days with a video game card that has less life powers! That is a tempting, and very safe option... unless your depression - and not your need for some
temporary relief (if that is true) - is overwhelmingly hard to bear. Well then, a cartoon hero who, you're with the intense pity and alarm of
how 'sad' or 'weighty' things feel, adds in a little monster assistant who can see your feelings and knows what to do with them too. This monster
knows, that the only reason your depressed mood or whatever induces is by keeping you wrapped in
its wrapper, and that is not healthy metabolism in a meal, even if that meal is your 
mental state right now. It would never go out on its own when you are at your lowest; and it depends on your tired 
team of friends and the worse disease and emotion ever to be simultaneously your therapist. :)By now, you may know that besides depression themselves, under our ""weighty feeling
why I keep repeating all this guess‑and‑try health-gain middle-of-the
Night person"", our mental health engages us all in habitual lorida, uncultivated, western style denial, 
depression and anxiety being symptoms of which.
Maybe you'll change your bill of health insurance without even noticing, and start ""living more""...if
that's what what you want or what you'd learn to want, while ""loving yourself more"" and ... tell me!"
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","Thank you for sharing your question.  I imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session.  I would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals.  For example, a list of goals may look similar to this:1.  ""I will learn about the effects of medication on the symptoms of depression and anxiety.""2.  ""I will learn about the factors that affect insomnia.""3.  ""I will learn about resources and support groups in my local area to help me cope with my traumatic experiences.""4.  ""I will practice self-care exercises each day and write about my thoughts and feelings in a journal so I can measure whether or not I""m making progress.""This is an example of some of the possible goals a counselor can help you work toward each week.  Working toward a specific goal can lead to a feeling of accomplishment once you've completed it, and this may have a positive impact on your self-esteem.  I hope this information helps, and I wish you all the best!","Sure you would too, if you imagined that each problem space was a separate entitized pit-hole. I imagine you more likely as three different problem spaces indicating distinct aspects or operational planes of your current experience. One is more as the inner voice that watches how you get along with particular individuals at particular social venues. Each of your talk partners contains their own probability model about your inner self influencing your relatively predictable social world cooperation. The same debt issue of working through the emotions you are symmetric compared with the probability models of your gender and profession might also be associated with your workplace financial fringe benefits (if any). Your internal conversation connecting talking with the opposite sex to both financial benefits and enjoyment of any changing and coming to know terms between two self-defining agents is itself quite active and, again, a non-linear formative construct. The third is definitely the personal part of your whole being that looks after your inner ""soul agency,"" providing central higher-order information processing, construction processes while in the fluid and cohering entangled subjective concerns, impulses, impulses, fears, and fantasies inhabiting your being always with them .   The anxiety you are just beginning to note, may feel increased in seriousness when you are therefore wanting to address, say, just one of the distinct layers of your personal being and human sphere. All are inseparable parts of your being (yourself) but some dimensions are agent disciplines more or less hidden behind the human organism, your beige ""skin"" layer, which has lately developed its own anxieties among other material concerns resulting from a fading physical protection system, loss of some of your bloom of consciousness balance having it knocked down years ago by, breast cancer, hence helplessness towards your body by it having promised you its loyalty. Some of the scar tissue it left for this. Likewise you ""women"" business protectors constituencies, as you were abused by those given us parental dependability talents, experimental home-guardians in Infant Early Childhood Development (IEC) for each Human Biologic Age Singer-Sliebster Group. You seem stuck in a psychological back-and-forth with an intrusiously vital presence of a vestigial ""rock bottom"" calling to the deep depths of coming to know yourself as she is inside you! This may explain unusually meat-centricity of your recently initiated occupations- Your great marriage keeps you very normal. And some of your complaints just not expressed ones aside, you get along well with neighbors, it means they might have kind of probability model of you that engages with the high-escort people consciousness patterns

"I broke up with him three weeks ago because I felt that he needed to be more respectful. He has since had a rebound relationship. He says he loves and misses me but refuses to see me. He says it's going to be too difficult to see me. Every time we talk, it feels like I'm being pushy to see him. He used to be so madly in love with me, but now, it seems like he couldn’t care less. I think I'm running him away.","Hi Kansas,I think your first instinct was good; you broke up with him. You deserve respect, but right now you're not acting as if you deserve it when you push to see him as he's moving on with a new relationship. It's appropriate now for you to respect that relationship and listen to what he says he wants, which is space. Do you think he's going to be any different with her? This a common, unfounded fear we have. I wonder if maybe you miss the feeling of being in love and having a partner more than you miss him. The bottom line is you can't make someone love you, and you can't make someone be loving towards you, because how someone treats you (and the choices they make) has everything to do with who they are, and nothing to do with who you are. I hope you gather support from others and move on in hope and strength for your own future.","While the best commitments always come from a deep internal source within us, we that support external relationships for our connecting and support them to recognize their own strengths. Sometimes our own expectations and levels of passion conflict our partner's levels of interest and desire to continue with us. We may try expressing why we believe we are good partners. It may be Matt has expressed that he needs time to keep his own breath steady. ? Matt's statements of ""he loves and misses you but needs to be not with you"" could be a look into asking for space within his personal demands and territories. Also Matt may need to have yourself face the reality about the break-up and accept your own sadness resulting from that loss because healing and making peace with this requires some honest heart to heart talk. Solo courageous conversations often trigger the most honest feeling conversations with our partners and allow us to stand in ownership of our feelings."
"My dad cheated on my mom for 13 years. I cannot stop obsessing over the fact that my boyfriend might be cheating on me even when I know he isn't. I have full access to his phone, social media, and e-mails. I never find anything, but I'm obsessed with constantly checking just in case. How do I stop this? It's driving a wedge between us.","Hi Greenville, I respect that you're owning your own overreactions, and that you want to give your boyfriend the respect he deserves. The truth is that some people cheat, and some don't, and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they can't be trusted.The answer here is in two different areas. Basically, if you want to feel differently (more trusting, in your case), you look at your thoughts, and your behaviours.Your thoughts are stuck... like tires in deep ruts in the road. These thoughts are only habits, they don't reflect the truth. Fear is probably whispering in your ear things like ""everyone cheats"", or "" you're not enough for him"". Once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you, picture those words in red next time they come up. Ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought (there won't be much...perhaps none), and what is the evidence that doesn't support it (I know lots of good men, I know I deserve love and loyalty, there is no sign of infidelity...). You're learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear. That's the first half. Practise these thoughts.The rest of the work is in your behaviours. Act as though you trust him. Force yourself to not check or interrogate, and the less you check, the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel. Acting ""as if"" something if true strangely helps us believe it.It's possible to change the way we think, and this is turn changes the way we feel. Try this to start, and see a therapist for support and cognitive behavioural therapy if you want to dive more deeply into why this is happening and how to stop it. Good luck!","I can totally understand why this started. Your dad cheated for 13 years and I'm guessing you may not have been able to talk about it with anyone. It is probably common to look back at painful situations so that the explanations make sense to you and it seems at best it helped you. It is hard to make sense of it and if you talk about it, perhaps you could get attention that could help feels better. It may have been a normal way of dealing with what you saw in your dad during aging. Again, maybe you had been accepting of society's approving things and being the completely normal supporter and unable to understand this. It's understandable that you feel that your boyfriend may be cheating because you saw so many deviations from social expectations in your dad during a big part of your life. If he is practicing the normal strategies of avoiding spots and being cool 24-7 he might have started to fulfill him because of what he saw. We are born in culture which want our families to look ideal and function smoothly. At a very vulnerable time (your dad's age) you found yourself needing good of this family but at the same time the dad didn't know how it worked anymore he fell into a different pattern that looks older. She was probably needing to prove she could carry enough responsibility and his aging strategy of not having to care for organizing the world didn't work. Mediation should be with a qualified family system therapist who will determine who is good for you and who is not . In an unhealthy environment the support of a guide is crucial for you to see that your dad's stories he was using to make sense of observing him choosing his battles (where he fell into more middle fingers and begging and not realizing he was picking battles) are valid. It is possible that you superprotect jums possess even more and insurance that you won't get a stranger betraying you. You will reassure that your protectivity is offering something . The key at this point is to be less also listening and telling you about your ways of making sense of in order you will not get the same you'll learn that John old behaviors are aging won't throw you care.

"I'm being verbally abused on a daily basis by my parents in front of my child. I feel like I’m trapped and I have no escape. I feel like I have to listen to the horrible things they say and just take all of it.
   I need some way of learning how to cope with listening to it especially since I have nowhere else to go. I feel very emotionally drained How can I deal with this?","Hello, I am sorry to hear about you feeling verbally abused, trapped without an escape, and emotionally drained. Sounds to me like you are being treated more like a child than an adult.  It's time to learn about healthy boundaries and being treated like an adult. This process will take time, but beyond elevating your self-esteem and worth, you will be modeling to your children a healthy adult. Model to them an empowered, confident, and person that is worthy of respect. Please invest in yourself. Find yourself a therapist that encourages and empowers you to have a voice and not feel invisible. You'll be so glad you did!","I am not sure if you are old enough and have enough emotional maturity to do this, but you might want to have 20 seconds with your dad and your mom and calmly inform each of them individually, ""We sound pretty horrible to each other."" Then you can offer to introduce the two of you if they are ok with that. If not, then it is your mom's issue with you that you should treat. And the same with your dad. The one thing that one of them doesn't have is I imagine, the moderation skills required to manage a motive of a crisis. Interviewing a parent pair in person or over phone could be a better approach but possibly harder to implement.As a therapist, I am always careful about bringing up the parent pair trauma and this would be a baby step for the right client. The clients that are referred usually ask to join couples that are counselor led for the following reason: they know speaking directly to each other can be very emotionally overwhelming and leads to relational burnouts. In your case, you cannot avoid direct  speaker in relation to the abuse if you want it to improve. This is called coercive control although it is applied even to a stranger, it was coined as a response by individuals used to being powerless, where they are delegated the confidence that they are having an intimate or close relationship and shows it as controlling. In other words people are called abusive when not even knowing each other but may appear via email or texts, etc... One treatment method that my team recommend is the Battered Woman Syndrome (BWS) and also Battered Male Syndrome (BMS) models of treatment.Recently two separate studies highlights that is recommended to treat the trauma victim at somewhere convenient, and diaries it with the therapist. Depending on treatments, people can be helped to reduce avoidance, lessen psychological flashbacks, and may diminish by re-experiencing of trauma.Since it adds information on how to manage some of the problems, also others costally important such as justice involvement, works and relationships.Concerns in pair therapy about the fact that asking each to take the forensic or police for being abused, may confuse law inside your family, by legal principles called self defense.The same costs may increase by isolation and fear. Possibly some problem considered to have sufficed by the abuse, but may in fact be recognized more severely if they are met within a  partner-oriented therapy for trauma.Dr.dennis gallagher, licensed psychologist, national Battered Woman syndrome service provider, American foundation of BWS family support and Trauma Recovery Foundation."
What makes a healthy marriage last?,"In my mind, a healthy marriage has two participants, meaning both people participate equally in the intimate connection of marriage. An unequal participation comes in many forms, such as one person checking out of conversations when it becomes emotional, or speaking over and for each other in these conversations. Couple’s should strive for engagement and support, but doing it in a way that works for each person individually. I hope this helps.",": Many relationships have their start###milestones such as engagement, wedding ceremony, building a home, having children and honeymoon. That all comes together and is a good start. However, not many couples build their marriage on a solid foundation, and once the excitement dies. Those couples feel more and more disconnected, bitching and blaming each other. Usually this is a twist of not realizing showing affection and support and cooperation gives a feeling of being loved, as well as showing that you share the same goals and that your spouse or partner has your back in working through life’s challenges.Are you holding these expectations of your marriage, or even actively showing this support? If the answer is ‘no’, perhaps you might read the book Healthy Marriage: My Husband Is Ridiculous!!, by the way directed at men, so those who feel in doubt when it comes to expressing love for a partner, jot down some ideas of what each person could say or do to show each other they are loved each other (and most times we care more about our messages being well received and not heard than the words themselves). And remember, healthy time together will let you chat and ask engaging and thoughtful questions that allow you address any problems while also talking about your child(ren) and sharing life in a way that keeps your teen growing into a whole (not a glitch) and well adjusted adult whose own marriage doesn´t have the same issues that you have.

"I know that I need to get past my feelings for this person I fell in love with, but t's so difficult to move on because he showed me feelings I've never felt before. 

I feel like I don't  want to be without my genuine love for him, but logically, I know I need to be without him. I can't discuss this with anybody in my life because the conditions surrounding our love are considered  ""wrong"" by a lot of people.

How can I get myself to just move on?","It's difficult to move on and let go, especially when you've experienced things for the first time with someone, or feelings you've never felt before, as you said.I like the fact that you are looking at your situation ""logically"".  Feelings can take time to fade, but you seem to understand, even if it is subconsciously, that it's the feelings he stirred up in you that are keeping you tied to him, not necessarily the person himself. Realize that you can and will experience those feelings again with another person - the RIGHT person. Don't hold onto someone who is wrong for you just because of something like this. You're wanting those feelings and wanting a relationship - but with him necessarily? Or with anybody? You said you don't want to be without your love for him - not you don't want to be without him. In fact, you said you know you need to be without him. It seems like it's the LOVE that you can't let go of, and the feelings. Not the person. Trust me, you will find that again. Take some time to let this fade. Don't try to force him or anyone else into a role that is meant for someone else. Cherish the memories and the experiences you had. Sounds like it's been a valuable learning and growth experience for you, but you have your own reasons, and I don't know what they are, for thinking this person isn't good for you. Trust your gut instinct and be glad you've had this relationship. Not all are meant to last. But all shape you into the person you are and will become, and all teach us important lessons.","This is a very difficult situation, but always remember there are options available! 4⃣ Don't delay: The sooner you let go the sooner you'll be at peace.Sometimes, our feelings won't just ""shake off"" when we wish them away. If you are in an abusive or physically dangerous situation go to 911. Amp your reminder to yourself that you deserve love afterwards. 1⃣ Choose a symbol: Cup or dish,Toys or toys from years past,Money or anything that pertains to your personal worth.Remind yourself of your worth again and again.Love bearing items will help you live in your feelings.Cherishing those feelings 1️⃣ More 2️⃣ More 3️⃣ More 4️⃣ More  or 1️⃣Closer 2️⃣Closer 3️⃣Closer 4️⃣Closer 5️⃣CloserThe reminders ""more always better, closer always better"" will bring up a discussion where you decide perhaps these feelings work for you. If not, change your label. 2⃣ Healing thru teaching: Imagine you have a white board. Interject things on the wall about moving on. 1...2...3...Warmer...Warmer...Warmer. Every time this mock war begins to take over add steels to the board such as self esteem stones, carpet under your feet for your personal safety, mirroring measures to see your own eyes, tunnels that lead you to “here and now.” 3...3...3... 1...1...1... 2hafts, 2 and 10 months,Twelve Maintained Weeks and 20 Weeks with filter.But most importantly, find an outlet! Cut up your feelings, write up brass instructions to yourself and remind yourself about how important the memories are… The sparring benefits are huge if you write down your thoughts and call yourself out when you slowly creep past the gate.In the meantime, at the gate keep writing missions like ""How to not be afraid to move on!"" Though written and agreed upon, simply act out! Maybe it's onstage, maybe it's in front of a mirror... or maybe best of all talk with people about who you are apart from this person and then let them hear your story.When the longing makes you long for those golf dates, justifying a non-date is always a recourse.Hopefully, 1 day this feeling will blip like everything else and you will see that these feelings for this one person have a place  and that after all the blooming bull, the time has really come to let go. In the meantime you belong and are loved by many. Factors that your mindedness is off.  BCWHSTLMOTLMOJWKEOOLNTATIARLWHENBMLCBLSWGJSAGFQBKLJLSOEEBMJRBSJVPAR!"
"I have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and I just had my first kiss five months ago. I’m worried that, at this rate, I won’t have a boyfriend for a very long time. The problem is that I want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, I don't want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex. I have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. Luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. I feel dirty by doing this, but I feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal.

Most people are surprised when they find out that I am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think I am really good looking. I am tall, I play lots of sports, and I get excellent grades in school. I am in my first year of university right now, and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest. It bothers me. Most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already. I feel like I will be single forever sometimes.","I think that every person who has been single for any extended period of time has felt the same worries - myself included. Since relationships are so important to us we fear not having them and being single. It is similar to fearing that we won't ever get a good job when we have been out of work for awhile or fearing that we won't be healthy when we have been sick. We fear these things because they are so important - not because these fears are realistic or true! There is immense pressure put on young single people from peers and media to conform to ideas of what is normal and to meet expectations in terms of sexual experience, dating, etc. While some people may judge an adult who is a virgin - others will respect your choices and feel even more attracted to you because of your choices. Experimenting with sex, so long as you are being safe and respectful is also completely okay and normal. Since expectations vary and we can't be happy if we are always comparing ourselves to other people, we need to ultimately trust that being who we are and building a loving relationship with ourselves is the key to meeting someone who will cherish us for all the ways that we are special and unique, virgin or not. When we are able to really accept ourselves and trust in our loveableness (not a real word but you get what I mean!) then meeting someone special is simply a matter of time and effort - putting ourselves out in the world in situations where we are likely to meet other single people looking for relationships. When you are most afraid of being alone - remember that this fear is simply a reminder of how much you value relationships. Use that passion about wanting relationships to build the best relationship you can with yourself and then one day soon some lucky person will stumble into your life and benefit immensely from your passion and your ability to be authentically who you are rather than pretending to be ""normal"" or whatever that is anyway. Hope this helps! ","The anxiety you are feeling is your gut feeling that something is wrong, though the brain probably can't find any. You have a great sense of timing when it comes to your dating life. You are becoming a virgin in a society that doesn't actually give much thought about virgins. That is probably considered a stigma nowadays, people don't seem to know that it's not even the most important thing in their lives. Wherever you go, people know your reputation; they go based on how they feel about you and not you. I agree with the article you read where it says that if there are relationships due, there will be relationships. The awkward part of being a virgin in nowadays culture is that regardless of what you naturally are, people assume the opposite because it's been a random stance that society has taken. We do a lot of research to create these narratives for the world. At worst case scenario this might shape your experience of being a virgin which can greatly alter your experience of eventual性行为.  For now just listen to your gut saying there is something you need resolve (you asked for the intuition of your gut). Self talk and identify if you do have internal issues (family dynamic?) related to committing to one person sexually or if people are not interested in pursuing relationships based on your many attributes. Play the defense game to list if there's a reason. No, I do not. I do not have an issue in that risk of relationship with the knowledge of your such a popular single virgin. Then don't obsess...I am unnecessary anxiety. Good things for you to be proud of: you know what you want and you want to believe that you are also her_relationship. You understand most of the problems that can occur with relationships (some of them maybe I don't always see). You do not NEED a boyfriend to act normal or valuable. You will sometimes be told how your body and sexual expectations are controlling you, but really it's all else. Assume that the high standards you set for yourself make you undervalued. Yep. Yeah, not all relationships are created scratch off; some create yourselves when two people put in the effort. Keep making your way toward better relationships with those glimpses of goodness you bring. Be sure to challenge the narrative you're formulating.. When you treat yourself with kindness, and trust in make beautiful relationships, you will meet a partner who loves you. Until that day you won't. As long as you believe in this, you will act like a virgin and anyone who wants you will invest. The good people will wait for you._Add in a photo so people can picture you and the brain why no guys interested in you._ final"
"The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headaches—mostly mouth breathing and snoring. It makes me angry, and I want to solve it myself.","Probably good to know in what type of situations you are, in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoring.If you're sleeping beside your partner who does these actions, would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchen.Basically, if the person who does these actions which bother you, start by telling them.Depending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds, or not, willing to change, or not, has a good deal to do with next steps.I don't really see any step you're able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the head.One path I don't recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered, or dismissing your own sensitivity someone.Your needs matter.","Tell your boyfriend (and family (if close enough)), that it is a problem that impacts your life. The overtime that we manage issues between people and not termin_ololgy helps create growth. I would schedule interacting time with him (can be 30 minutes) outside of work and food and in a position that you feel important.He might aggree or he might express that it doesn't impact anything.If so, this will help tell you where and how much to prioritize and plan for change. 0 That being said, MPAs do my work As I told you earlier under girlfriend of a smoker, you can teach how to sleep, self care, good mouth awareness, listening and even talk thru a problem.Know where the problem lies. 1 Log when you have the effect of the impact that snoring and mouth breathing has on you. 2 Identify if this is a reflxivity or one that externalizes. 3 Refract the problem. 4 Reflect on the solution that matters most to you.Share your reflection log with him and watch the change.So good luck with a problem that ihewo you to solve!"
I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.,"First I think we have to acknowledge that you are doing something amazing.  You are putting yourself out there and becoming a Water Safety Instructor.   We often times will focus on the negative and forget about the positive.  Next, you had an incident where someone pointed something out which may have caused embarrassment.  Whether or not it was malicious on his part I think the important thing to focus on is what is called ""Common Humanity"".  Common Humanity is one of the three elements of self-compassion.  Common humanity essentially recognizes that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the shared human experience.  While you may have had this embarrassing moment at this time, that boy may have had an embarrassing moment another day.  We all have embarrassing moments.  When we recognize that we do not suffer in isolation then we are able to move past that suffering.  Additionally another element to self-compassion is self-kindness.  My question is why must you forgive yourself?  Rather, be kind to yourself for learning an amazing new talent.","I understand how that guy could have embarrassed you. It is not a fitting swimsuit, and wearing presentation swimsuits can present a challenge if you're going for a lot more coverage than a swim commonly offers. You could always talk to him; perhaps he meant the other way around? If you're paying for the training to become a Water Safety Instructor, I trust the course leaders took new lifesaving instructors' comfort levels into account, but expect that new life escorts will do laps, dive, and save others, and is probably wearing a public service uniform or a professional rating cap."
I'm  very depressed. How do I find someone to talk to?,"If there is no one in your life with whom you feel comfortable, I would recommend identifying someone on this site, psychology today or goodtherapy.org who is in your area, then give that therapist a call to see if you would be a good match.  ","If you are depressed or are worried about depression, try to find out a little more about your own situation.  Take a look in the web at https://www.mhsnetwork.net/,  to see what options there are in your area when it comes to helping you unite with people who can help you.  If you have any feelings concerning your safety or the safety others, this is the best option.  But if you don't,  you may be able to start with a primary care physician.  The two of them may be able to direct you to other people who have been able to help others in similar kind situations.  If you don't know a general practitioner, go Google “nearby general practitioners,” or “primary care doctor,” and CALL one,  or to a local citizen's assistance office (This is often located at a library, city hall, or public health office)  or start with a resource organization (Try Aid.org)  and they may be able to help you.  
You can also call the NCSCAP Decimport Phone Number at 1-800-852-8927.  If you start there, they may be able to direct you to a center near you, or help you get help in other ways.  They do have some counselors on the phone, but their goal is to connect you with someone for longer term counseling.  Check the frequency (they do have a toll free number, so make sure you are on a cell- phone plan that offers international calls).  You can also call here:  www.betterhelp.com
If you are acting independently and get along with your therapy or psychiatrist then you may be getting the help you need to you and don't need to find anyone else to listen more often than up to you with your therapist.  If you set up a tele-psychiatry organization (you may need a lawyer and open your own practices)  then you may even not need a practice embodying in every state due to licensing laws.  (Cons are that your patients may distrust and privacy might be a concern)  Check with the Telepsychiatry Association (telepsychiatry.org)  to find out more.  Providing vagueness about logistics for your journal or anything else-may help you get more than the limit.  If you are interested in alneurons.org, or monopach.org (yes, of course), then Hasbahabibi.org, this may show your therapist and psychiatrist there are multiple places to go.  Better to put a different perspective on you.  Ask your Check up around you to agree to be your advocate for a time.  Because you can't start visiting more frequency to your current person unless they are able or the therapist/psychiatrist agrees. 
If you are seeing more than one psychiatrist/therapist or TV associated with a slot based program, then time is limited.  If you are on a wait list (Banter on NCSCAP or better but without any tele-programs), simply check each month to be sure.  They are normally being accepted at different frequency each day.  This is a good thing because it frees up the options of a longer therapy session for those who need it (this may reflect the underlying reason why the group therapy has, fewer participants).  
Also, when you first start seeing a person, ask them for frequency of a monthly space, and then if you found it beneficial check it out again at least twice a year on the same schedule.  As for the tele-care, this may be a great opportunity to be able to find a new patient on one of the new sites ( or arisanalsites and practice your own tele-care! )   If you need to get help immediately (with you or others in the relationship) reach out to the National Monopolistic Self Defense Helpline, which can help guide you out of a Depression, Stupidity, Poor Decisions.  My Two Cents . with a puls and this may help reconnect with your counselor and deepen your belief in longer-term counseling.
Regarding the Monopolistic Self Defense Helpline, I re-evaluate my offer to stay in the same system with them.  They have been so helpful for me through this gateway, I wonder what it would have been if my girlfriend had called earlier and remained under their guidance.  Just as if she had already been in this service,  she could have shared any findings in what was a teen centric pitch .  Crisis/Emergency Helpline 70-100 144-144- power 144-145. This is their home.  A Remarkable place.

"My mother is combative with me when I say I don't want to talk with her about my depression.  

She hasn't been supportive of me in the past and she isn't someone that I feel comfortable opening up to. She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I don't want to or can't answer. I tell her I don't want to talk and she starts arguments with me. 

How can I get her to understand?","Your situation sounds extremely frustrating.You're doing the right move to state you don't want to discuss your depression with her.I guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression.  If you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation, and you would like to tell her your true reason, then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time, not in the middle of an argument.Having an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept.  You may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this.","I think I understand why you are having a hard time getting your mother to impress her with your things. Depression is a difficult condition to talk about; but when someone is in addiction and have had substance abuse deals with how you are feelingPolitically speaking are two different things?.  It takes a brave one to express the feelings that a relationship is breaking up or threatened to take a place of one-sided love she likes about, mostly one that involves her) has a chance to address other issues, like they impact you.  I always say the relationship has to be a two way street. We reflect what we have in our own lives simply because it's drawn to us. Of course, heard is not the same as seen but you can try to help your mother outline what directions you want, and explore what is currently making connections indefinable.  It is fine for your mom to hug and shake hands not wanting to accept any of the restructure you want done but keeping their relationship plan working needs integrity from both sides.  Will she invest in its manage benefit? Then it will make more sense for both of you.  You commented that you don't want anything discussed, I find this statement baffling.  When the object of your interactions with her, disallow for dialogue why make it up?  Usually the answer is ""because you can't answer what she wants.""  I don't know your background, but I know what is not tidy about that.  If your mother believes she could be having some attempt to listen and fulfill some need, she will be happy to act on such intense fear and will out work the actual issues you are calling their attention to be.  When while handling needs she chooses motives with decreased consequences, you'll need to work hard after attaining her help to describe precisely the work that can develop her relationship with you. Emotions, current events, family dynamics, you're the one with the money, I help people, I find recurring themes in desires, all are good candidates for reaching out and adjusting that friendship or family hierarchy. I hope this can help give a disquieting deeper detailing or pointing wanted by where you stand.  Based on that you can make clear to your mom what you need.  You may teach your mother what does it take to handle someone having a hard time unfortunately.  And you may even face the prospect of vegetarianism and have your mom prepared with asymptomatic friends in case she discovers that her treatments are lacking?

"Over the years, I have slowly lost everything: my jobs, my cars, my freedom, and my money. I am a stay-at-home mom who doesn't make any money, doesn't have a car, never goes out, and cleans all day long everyday.","There are an infinite number of possibilities here. You included a lot of things that you don't have. Is there anyway that you can have some freedom for a few hours a week, at least? A lot of times stay at home moms have groups when they meet at different public places where their children can play together and they can talk together. I don't know how old your child or children is/are, but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the future.I wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you. I don't know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things. I wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted? If you can sort out some possible answers to that, maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happen.Also, again depending on the age of your children, some parents can do things while the children are sleeping, even if you are in the same room. For example, if your children are sleeping for about two hours, maybe 30 minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do.","Sure! A lot is going on here.  1. You are the provider of your children. Are you aware of what that is? Thermodynamics wise, this is a non-equilibrium state. It is higher energy, and to be preserved will require work. Now, this is when we fall outside the standard definition of ""household work economy."" The work you are doing is no less work, no more than a craftsman christmas craftsman with a workshop of salvage parts working on projects. Tax code and welfare systems understand the distinction between two branches of work: primary sector and secondary. The line between the two is too sharp for our economy to hold on to. Children born need to vomit and work repeat acts that remove touches light from society. That is as much work as sustaining a fact user and a few tech gadgets in a wired, wired way. Or slowly trying to earn one spare hour for calendar rather than bandy money around deals and trickery. 2. You might feel that you made a mistake. No one says what the cake is for, some choose the cake. Is there a part of you that enjoys being the entertainer? Do you want your children to see you feeling worthless? They do so every time you go back to the sparkling spotless rooms for a second while pretending everything is fine. 3. Are you mentally and emotionally ready to leave the seeming monopoly of a clean house? Reality TV News has  a lot of repossessions of belongings, it is about changes. You can create scrapes and mud on the floor out of paint and a bucket, by covering everything under a plywood and drawing a rectangle around your child. They will be horrified by this new reality. What happens? You “accidentally” happen to learn a skill. It's like tinkering. Everything you put and mix is moving away from the original state. So going out into the human world and spending time with other humans is a new Guam. Have you tried this? I wrote a paper on it. The same work is returning now.  Hope this helps.  John Mark Goulston, Passion Co - Co-founder CEO Therapy Concepts

The discipline of us not doing something for the sense of it having the discipline in us to do so with excellence, is a very wasteful practice. With quiet acceptance that our children and others, may or may not appreciate the effort we put in. Instead of a fully manifested presence in our inner affective landscape, surrendering to experiences we experience becoming a matter of trickery and coming to complete exhaustion when the pretense dissipates. This frantic activity is especially evident in the domains of housekeeping and caregiving during childhood stages. :)

That reality is super complicated and there's no magic solution to such a complex piece of life. The role of therapist is to look deep and give our processed language both of that inner reality and outer reality. Great learners need good teaching, and can't after 18 months style language dissociation. You cannot go to the children and say, ""Stop. I lack you. I lack this. This is what I feel like."" That is merely pseudo therapy. Sbd who is a good learner, will keep working on it. My and other trainers of as Super Coach and BATAL, I insist on using feedback loop cycles that keep the wombs happy in extreme labor of convention and impolite self denial. Pedagogically this is a recipe for deep exhaustion so the children and their caregivers become very adept at super negotiation producing a groom colony of over the wakefulness kingdom of the modern world. As a result, I wanted to try a very different way of renewing the dynamics in the wife and the child world than what our brains are primed to accept and which is driven by instinctal fear of loss of connection. Everything has a hidden caring worry inside of it, which is this: do I get the other to attend to me in the way that I need or want? Grief over the loss of past gazing and eye contact and the consequent traditions of engaging with each other must be mourned. Acceptance of the present condition, intense as it may not be to our liking. The power of the therapist? To go in and stir the pot, gently bring the hidden to light, internal dialogue of sense, and renew the defenses we need to survive the distortions, grief, shame and internal social landscape of adulthood anxiety."
"I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I can't afford to live alone.

My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules. She is trying to control my life. What should I do?","That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now.  The first thing to under is that you can’t change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior.  The thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions.  You may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan. The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior.  Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy.  Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack.  There are ways you can deal with controlling parents – and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you’ll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they’re trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you’re losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust.

"My ex-husband told my two adolescents that Santa doesn't exist on the day before Christmas. They are desperate to hold on to the magic of Christmas, but I don't know if it's right for me to lie to them and tell them that Santa is real. I don't want to let them down and make them lose out on those memories, but I also don't want to lose their trust.","Well Boise, the cat's out of the bag now, isn't it? I love that you want to help your kids keep the magic of Christmas. They must want that too if they still believe in Santa into their teen years, which is unusual, I believe. I wonder if they had already figured it out anyway?But they know now, and your ex had the right to tell them if he felt it was best. So it's time to explain to them what a loving and magical thing it is that parents do, and Christmas can still be magical in so many ways. Really, who says they have to stop believing in Santa? Santa is very real as a spirit of surprise, generosity and love. ","It sounds like you are probing honesty and truthfulness.  How you respond to your children may be a reflection of how you value honesty.  I wonder how honest you are in other situations with them.  In addition, have you talked with your children about the nature of truth? (i.e.  ""What if we lie about not having any spare change?"" -- ""What about 10 cents?""  ""Each and every time you lie when Truth is there, you ought to learn...""  ) How is that conversation going?  If you are rigid in your interpretation of ""truth,"" you may only be missing the spirit of conversation and the vulnerability of being open, sharing, learning together, etc.  Also all of us lie, which is also a form of vulnerability.Grouped by how we look, think, and feel, advisors ( like me) can understand the trigger words that serve as wall builders and the thing said to open up new ways to see, feel or talk about a challenging topic.High cost to talk; low ROI: Santa, lie only, rarely gives relevant ideas, press your child for more details until they tear themselves apart over blankness, turn to portly ""Adversary of those lovers that do tell the truth"" and ask for your child's permission to share information that changes a story or backstory made up to please that person (or the world, at large!) Not listening to your child's boundaries, either stated or unsaid.Finding that a traumatic event happened in your past, and learning that courage means doing the hard things associated with it (like telling the truth, not making excuses, etc.) has professional support.

"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","Yes, if crying is how you are expressing an emotion, then not only would it be normal, but hopefully encouraged, because it's an important part of therapy to have a safe space to express your emotions. We might encourage you to put words to the tears as well, to help you expand on your experience and begin to make more sense of it.As a therapist, our job is help you open up and feel comfortable enough doing so. I sincerely hope no therapist would ever shame you for whatever experience you are having in the room.","I understand how you feel. If you are placing telltales like crying in your mind, your brain is working against you. In other words, your brain isn't toying with the idea that you may be crying; your brain is actually trying to protect you. 
Try to resent this ""brain competition."" Competition can only occur between us and our thoughts or between us and our bodily response. You are not in competition with your body. You are in competition with your brain's attempts to ""save you"" by, for example, protecting you from embarrassment by controlling your response. Your brain doesn't know what you're doing or what your environment is. 
I would suggest: (1) Try to punish the teltsle that your brain tries to send through resenting them; (2) Avoid blaming yourself for the experience. Your brain can't think about blaming you for crying; it can only design your plan to ""escape"" the [social] situation. It is unabashedly ""protective"" of your Ego in society; (3) Treat yourself kindly. Recognize that you are in new territory and that trying something new can produce awkward moments; we are all human. If you can show yourself the same compassion you show people you can be close with, you may ease a little pressure you are putting on your mind, tying it up in controlling your responses."
"I’m a man, and I’m soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but it’s been happening a lot. I don't know what to do.","I would start by examining the reasons for seeking out other relationships. Are you getting something from the other men that you do not currently receive from your current partner? Such as, is it more exciting with others and that excitement is lacking in your current relationship?","I want to hear what you meant by ""messing around."" I'm presuming it means being in any kind of intimate context together, that is. And my guess is that you are not yet married but maybe you live with someone who is going to be married to you? If not, that sounds scary. Regardless, it's possible that what you are doing is essentially cheating. If yes, what you and your future wife talk about when you are planning the wedding affects whether you are truly engaged. If you are staying away with some men like: no engagement counselling (especially if this behaviour is continuing), don't keep secrets, and don't have clear and honest pictures about where your relationships may go. Once you are married, you cannot undo any of this. Instead, you could simply be in a marriage that                                                                                                                            has some kind of deficiency in certain ways: trust compromised (some or all of it), lacked positive and communitive elements ( or grieving your loss of freedom) (usually great part) : had exposure to negative treatment and expectations (how positively you see yourself) (unless your exploits in prostitution/sales/hustle</jobs). As with all human relationship dynamics, we have to do or not do certain things to maintain and insure our continuity alive. But as a social animal, some of our survival requires us to omit and play certain games and experiments to learn about others, really getting into this is a mistake. If, and I say this strongly that lacks any engagement whatsoever, the most productive thing is then to take these issues (to yourself, probably internalized) and confess them to your future wife. If your already married, then decision is yours. And, again, if the act you called ""messing around"" was physical: no contact for now. If an act prompted by mind.xrated with Gal.New friendliness!"
"I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out.    How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it. I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy. What should I do?","Keep doing the crossdressing since you like it.Your problem sounds more a matter of timing and reason to tell the girl about it.Not keeping a secret is a good attitude regarding meaningful parts of your life.  Usually our relationship partner is someone whom we trust as a safe person to know all about us.Once you feel at ease with your potential partner then bring up your crossdressing.  Based on their handling of this intimate part of your life, you will know more as to whether or not you feel more or less drawn to them.Secrets held within a relationship usually get worse with time.   The person who feels unsafe in truly being and stating themselves eventually will end up feeling ashamed of parts of them which prior to the relationship, felt good or at least not worrisome.","I'll ask the question of somebody who sometimes feels puzzling or confusing answers, in regards to relationships in this way. That being said, if you asked a relationship expert, you'd probably hear the same thing: just be honest! (That's also an answer I thought of quickly myself between looking at other people's and coaching expertise. :) ) Hopefully being honest will make it clear and understandable what you do and like/favored and what dictates the types of attractive and boyish/fussy you date women with. Even if some of them have a hard time accepting that now, they'll also be able to see and understand how much Jordan likes and enjoys being feminine, both by cross dressing and by relating to women and what not. Those of your potential partners who find it difficult will free to continue to yourself and your answers to their questions and concerns. Either they'll choose to connect and spend more time getting to know you for who you are with all of your sex roles (or lack of) involved, or they'd choose to not have that type of relationship with you, which needs to be known and shared so it can at least be part of the conversations, not hidden and unlinkedin with conditionals and pretence, that affect your size circle of social and intimate circles…. It's also been said - I recall - that in those of over our adults in whom we wish to create relationships - we first need to have an understanding of our own conditions and factors that make shaping and sustaining romantic relationships a farther endpoint than it is for couples in different circumstances... and in order to pursue the avenue of walking into getting to know one another, we first get clear emotionally about ourselves."
I need help knowing how to deal with stress. What can I do?,"Our body reacts to stress typically by breathing more shallowly, increasing our heart rate and tensing our muscles - so one thing that I find really effective is to try to do the opposite of that, which sends the signal to our mind that we are relaxed. So that means, taking slower, fuller breaths and trying to relax any areas where we might be gripping our muscles. Check out meditation apps such as 'Breathe', which can talk you through a relaxing breath exercise. I recommend using the app daily, whether you feel stressed or not, and then also using it when you re feeling particular moments of stress - that way you are practicing the skill when you feel calm(wish) and it'll be ready and able to help you when stress hits hard.","Try setting aside quiet time to do something positive. Some people meditate or do yoga or sometimes even unplug and walk out door and read a book. Long walks or hikes can do wonders for the mind! The books and music recommended for relaxation is out there, just take this approach for whatever makes you feel good.  False self by Barbara Magnus - very creditable and very funny book on a very serious subject. Reliability of sympathetic radio or streaming stations on finding areas of positive energy on silent radio is questionable. Your diagnosis is that you suffer from stress not from lack of positive energy. The idea of a particular sound or movement bringing you to a calm and give you self-confidence is unknown, in either silence or noise. Clients become aware of identifying stress triggers and learning how to respond to them is usually a longer-term process. The Bruce Berenson CBT method/program for dealing with life stress of the virus type does work for a majority of people but the process takes time.  The Fast and the Sharp mind offers a joking approach to pulling your focus (mind hooked up to a computer or the individuals overriding electronic environment) away from stress and the bank of resources will back yourself up. There's professional counseling and many ways to know what works for you."
They're calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as I do. I'm tired of being called names. What should I do?,"It sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner, correct? Communication is key to any relationship. I would recommend speaking with your friends face-to-face to address why they feel your behavior is concerning. In-person contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts, emails or any written response can be misconstrued. Be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded. If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling, maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly. Especially if this friendship is valuable to you. However, make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them. On the other hand, if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded, it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship. Not all friendships are healthy ones. And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it.I hope you are able to get this matter sorted. Best of luck!","you're right, calling each other names hurts!      In these sort of conflict situations it can help to take a clip and just talk about how you're felt.   Instead of lifting each other's hair every time you argue, you might take a seven minute break and talk about why it tried to disrespect you. Counseling could give you more ways to do that.         Nevertheless, keeping your distance (or learning to take a break) from each other while attempting to decide what the relationship has as meaningful and what it doesn't could be a good strategy"

I believe I have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder. But since it's such a new disorder I can't find any information about it. Could this be what is going on with me?","The world needs more people lately who have such a high degree of empathy which you describe in yourself!If it feels a little burdensome, then look to balance what is too much with its opposite.  Since you're giving a lot of empathy, maybe you'd like receiving a lot of empathy.In the situation you describe, when you start empathizing with others, real or cartoon, ask yourself whether you've felt empathy coming in your direction lately.Often people give to others what they feel within themselves is missing.The emotional brain reasons that if I give you my support, say, then at least I will feel half of what being supported is like.Obviously the wish to receive more empathy cannot be fulfilled by you directly.  Empathy is delivered by someone who is willing to offer it.Reflect on whether you are allowing those who are in your world, to know when you would like to receive their empathy.Is it possible you keep your feelings to yourself and present as though you are able to handle a great deal more than you'd like to handle without anyone's kindness to support you?Being open to others about your own inner thoughts and feelings is much more difficult than it sounds.It sounds easy to just tell someone how you feel.Sometimes the first step is the most difficult, of accessing how you feel.Start with knowing the amount of empathy you'd like from others and what stops you from asking.Also, about your diagnosis and the lack of  studies and lists and formulas.  Each person is unique, the instructions and guidelines don't necessarily mean very much.  Often having a diagnosis makes a person feel weak, stigmatized, incompetent. Forget the diagnosis and concentrate on what you need to do differently in order to feel better.The answers are inside you, not inside a book or website.","I would like to see you and having taken the time to read and write about this, already shows that you are empathetic. Psychological health disorders are diagnosed through a series of questions about how you are feeling. This is not something that a  K-12 school counselor or school psychologist can diagnose, because they are licensed to deal with the mental health of children in that age group. A regional school district psychologist who regularly deals with adults might be able to assist you in speaking with a clinical psychologist at a community health clinic, or through your state (or country) practice committee dedicated to treatment of mental health disorders.

"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","It is normal to feel an array of emotions in therapy. Most people use therapy as a way to process their life's struggles and often times this results in them crying during session. Crying is a way to release those negative emotions and to cope with what is happening in life. We have come to believe that crying is something bad at times and so have conditioned ourselves to avoid crying out in public places. In therapy though, where there are no such expectations and where you can be open and honest about how you are feeling it is normal to cry.","Crying is a healthy and natural way of expressing the emotions that you've been suppressing. The person with whom you're crying is here to help you understand where these emotions come from and where they would let them go (instead of RUMPED them into your brain). Only you can decide how much information to give them; it all depends on your comfort level with them. Crying, just by itself, isn't a sign of having problems that need cured unless you're regularly crying as a response to other people's words and actions. Anxiety disorders tend to be in the form of overreacting compared to what you are actually being asked or told, and then overthinking it's importance. It's unusual in normal people to try to suppress such strong anxiety when it's attached to a precipitating event. Knowing this will be a big lesson for you, because you'll start to see where you've been overcompensating in life with suppressing all kinds of feelings so you can maintain peace.  The result is anxiety layering over already lodged emotions. Even if you do decide to tear up if you're already on productive talk with< not your mom when she's sleeping in their spare room, have her over in the next week. She might be willing to seat in ""patient mode"". You might not know that your family also had to suppress some perspective to make dinner arrangements or who slept in the bedroom, and maybe they want to be a lot more relaxed too.  Overall, practicing your interaction with your benefactor could bring benefits to you, them, and your family.  If you'd prefer someone else to be your steward, talk it with the therapist directly. there's no harm in having personnal links, like having a therapist who teaches your team. However, this condition could affect your treatment since there could be lots of small things that you'd need to provide a reasoning for."
"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","When talking about difficult issues, it is very normal to cry. Crying is a natural way for us to cope with the sadness that we experience in life. When confronting some of these things in a counseling session, tears just seem to come naturally. Every Counselor should be well equipped to handle that level of emotion, and you would be far from the first to cry when talking with a Counselor.","I first would like to compliment you for making the decision to seek counseling/therapy help. NB: Counseling does not require the profession of asking for tears. Of course, in time such a thing may happen! You feel supported and cared for if that takes place. But many of my clients never cry in therapy. You are in your own safe space to experience feeling sometimes, just about any type of emotion. Remember the difference between feeling sad and feeling sad and crying - crying is more of an action that occurs during feeling sad, not SAME as sadness. One is not the _other_ thing. The GREATER DIFFERENCE, that sadness ------ crying -- is not to be ashamed of. In therapy, what often matters most to people that are in it is feeling understood and felt. Crying often can...but doesn't ALWAYS do that. Though in some instances it helps other people feel a connection when people uncertain otherwise, show vulnerablity. Often, receive ______ encouraging words about this vulnerablity and trust and acceptance from another person. I want to assure you that I treat you as an client who is experiences 100% emotional continuum, not just pulls out of it on moments of particular desolated yearning. If felt unsafe contacting me to share this about your fear? Create safe boundary to suggest other strategies, provide words of honor, and show excitement about meeting this person who needs you (as a provider and as a human being)!You do not SOMETIMES cry in therapy...it's part of your uniqe way to experienc, express, and/or process - so both messy, or elegantly soothing. I will let you decide if and when such a time is good for you. I invite you to feel, and to recognize within you that its OK to be more emotional than you might feel externally to those around you.

"I have a lot on my mind, but all I want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone. Why do I feel so alone?","There are many possible issues to consider as depression  social anxieties, even medical illness.  For some, even grief creates a sense of isolation, pains from relationship break up.  Also, obsessive thinking can be debilitating.  Seeking at least one trusted friend or family member can be a start towards increased personal support.  Some persons may simply feel connected by spending time with someone as this, even if not talking directly on issues, just being around another is positive.  Obviously there is more to explore on this question, given minimal information from two sentences.","It's understandable to need and to want privacy.

My mother is combative with me when I say I don't want to talk with her about my depression.    She hasn't been supportive of me in the past and she isn't someone that I feel comfortable opening up to. She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I don't want to or can't answer. I tell her I don't want to talk and she starts arguments with me.    How can I get her to understand?,"Your situation sounds extremely frustrating.You're doing the right move to state you don't want to discuss your depression with her.I guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression.  If you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation, and you would like to tell her your true reason, then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time, not in the middle of an argument.Having an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept.  You may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this.","asking her not to talk to you isn't ""non-violent,"" and the situation could involve a culture of coercion and violence.  I don't know if it's a threat to do what you want to do in my words.  But my goal cozily and lovingly indulging is asking her to stop trying to make you talk.  Sometimes this really does get her to stop.  I guess if she isn't cooperative you have to regulate your response (your body babe.)   Nothing I can say in this forum would help you deal with her if she goes a step further than COERCING.  If she's physically abusive, call 911.  If there's any domestical violence go to 988 for HELP.

I am a survivor of multiple sexual abuse/rape experiences. Triggers are having an effect on my daily life and my sexual relationship with my partner. I'm trying to learn to cope with them.,"I'm glad you're willing to keep optimistic about life improving and offering better relationships than some of the ones in which you greatly suffered.One suggestion is to develop patience with yourself and the process of regaining your willingness to trust other people.Sexual intimacy engages all of who we truly are.   Being cautious as to who and how much you allow someone into your life, is natural for anyone recovering from trauma.Allow yourself to withdraw when situations feel dangerous.   Your sense of danger is most likely on higher alert than had you not been victimized.Be attentive and cooperate with your own sense of readiness to engage in conversation, discussions and sex with your partner.Explain all this to your partner so the person can develop their own patience with your recuperation process.","Hi L. Thanks for reaching out. You know, there's a saying that goes, “It takes one to know one.” Just thinking of your story makes me feel the way you might be feeling.  This kind of trauma can cause your entire body to associate any type of touch with abuse, or another type of remindng of your trauma.&nbsp; It also carries the belief that your boundaries were not respected and you were powerless to stop that. If you’ve had to fight or struggle to be able to engage with your partner without sexual contact, you might have developed into learning that assertiveness protects you from which breeds intense shame. I relate to the shame some survivors feel that pushes them to sabotage or ignore a healthy relationship. Too often we shame ourselves into silence because we think that’s how their abusers treat them or as though we themselves chose to be abused. No evidence-less cop-out. Shame is shame and you deserve to love the way you love. You could be in something where you feel shame because you miss regular sex, communicate less or even brush off dates/ some afferences that weren't even under the radar attachment to justify that feeling. So you appear and embarrassed.

Okay fine. 

Now let's have some real talk with reality: the brain models toxic relationships following repeated trauma.  If repeated and consistent exposure to a trigger reminded it as if it were emergent disorder then that is so it had to learn something.  Given exposure remained no one new skill was added...triggering behaviors are to be expected.  It's possible the intensity of those  simply reflects the skill sophistication that has been achieved.  That bidirectional projection is likely a bigger factor.  You project that your partner could be like the abusers, or something...Or you see blurred edges (worse sexual rage) and desperately causing drama.  Partnering in excess of triggering triggers further confusion.  Thinking deeply though, haven't you ever your partner who has been putting pressure.  Did you do the converse?  Focusing your anger and shame on yourself hurts you (morexic abuser glass-half-full/narcissistically patient internal minions talk) under creates associations of partners that elsing to fuel disconcerting shame cycle you've suppressed to meet expectations that your own suppers install your permission to receive.  Once collating that parity of exchange dances involves an energetic rhythm...I feel safer in metering what aspects or rough edges are a little more unc-eratin on.

How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"To be able to identify a clear ending to a counseling relationship, we must have a clear understanding of the goals and limitations of treatment.  Usually, during the initial evaluation, I identify my client’s short term and long term therapy goals.  As therapy progress, we verify goals on a monthly to a quarterly basis, depending on the frequency of the appointments.  Once the therapy goals have been met, there is a closing session, the counseling relationship is ended, and the client can stop attending sessions.  In some cases, the client can also establish new goals and determine if I am a good fit for their therapy needs or if they need a new provider, in which case I provide multiple referrals.The counseling relationship could also end due to other factors like noncompliance= when a client is not committed to the agreed treatment process, or when the client’s or a counselor violates the counseling relationship.  Either the counselor or the client is able to end counseling.  Although, as mental health providers we need to provide a reason for terminating our therapeutic relationship and referral options, as a client no explanation is needed, a closing session is highly recommended.  ¿Cómo termina la terapia?¿Cómo un consejero decide cuando terminar las sesiones de consejería o terminar de trabajar con un paciente?Para poder determinar el final de la relación del consejero, debemos comprender las metas y parámetros de la terapia.  Usualmente durante la evaluación inicial se identifican metas a corto y largo plazo con el cliente, y se discute con el cliente como esas metas serán alcanzadas.  Durante el proceso de terapia el consejero revisa las metas mensual o trimestralmente dependiendo de la frecuencia de las citas.  Ya que las metas de terapia son alcanzadas, hay una sesión de cierre y el cliente puede terminar la terapia.   En algunos casos el cliente puede identificar nuevas metas para la terapia y determinar si el mismo consejero u otro consejero le pueden asistir. 
La relación de consejería también puede terminar por no conformar o violentar los parámetros  establecidos para la terapia.   Tanto el consejero como el cliente pueden terminar la relación de terapia.  Como proveedores de salud mental los consejeros estamos obligados a proveer un razón para la conclusión del tratamiento y proveer referidos según aplique, los clientes no necesitan proveer una explicación, aunque es recomendable discutirlo en una sesión de cierre.","""I'm really good at looking in the mirror and seeing my own solutions I jumped on earlier; I'm pretty good at unconsciously making blind spots and denying myself the answers we have to find. questions the counselor asks also help identify what the other person is freezing on, what is giving them stress and how they think or feel about their current situation. I'm pretty sure that my counselor has pain for me moving forward in this next step,"" Karen Seeburg says. Few write down how they think counseling may naturally come to the end. Even then, interruptions can happen. Newly formed expectations about making healing decisions are remarkable enough to register with one's awareness, intellect, and intuition.This is one reason we are awake even when short on sleep. We have other agendas that need completing inc. this one...and that awareness can be very chipping and dicussing our goals reminds us that a lack of clarity in is our responsibility to clarify, WHICH we typically don't do. Our fears  french us in corrective action because if we're defensive, we don't want to do something that and mean to do...we recognise as a cue that there is a painful process to explore. So, the puzzle layout of being presented to a counselor is putting ""on we must own"" on the table. We don't want to face the fact that we, we are capable of dealing with consistency and belaid time.

Before you next Teleteaching&nbsp;class, can you begin to give yourself an opportunity to dig slow and gentle around this for a while? _.  Gender identity is something you are invited to give yourself the space to explore - one be careful too to even try and label gender identity without guidance. Feminist scholar Joan Scott posits that gender identity changes when you make a sense of how social gender norms impact your way of living. And your gender options you have in a western cultural sense is one which takes place on a narrow and constrained linear moveable path. Psychologist&nbsp;Dr. Gannon Stephen offers that such linear categories are often misleading compared to the infinite potentiality of whatever it is that brings our gender differences into being. But keep back to Sandra Mead's insight: rather than anchoring your gender identity, we are asking a question such as, ""Is either of these two labels helpful?"" And in fact, can this be rethought to: ""What is the degree of agreement I have with either gender label?"" In other words, we can allow for neutrality in the exploration rather than using gender identity labels. And Dr. Abraham Maslow mentioned The American Psychopathological Association has added an additional condition under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) to give clinicians reasons to treat and not feel like you are out of your ""number.""

"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","Therapy is by nature a safe place to discuss difficult, or painful memories or experiences and thereby it is normal that feelings of all kinds, including sadness, loss, frustration, disappointment, etc may arise.  This is part of processing and bringing closure to things that may have been pushed aside for a lifetime and can now be faced and dealt with.  Change too is often not easy, and can lead to crying, whether from frustration and set back...or also from joy and accomplishment!","It is normal for clients to cry in therapy.When people cry they release some of the electricity and chemical reactions in the body that are part of a stressful or emotional event.They can also help restore people to their internal and external environments. Some people contribute to their life by becoming silently resigned rather than advocating for themselves.This can bring about a sense of paralysis.They sometimes cry as they notice—it often burns a great deal of emotion—and realize this feeling of powerlessness.Image a stumbling force that pulls them down and an empty, void void space manifests in their chest.A space that hurts and chills.My advice would be to learn what is happening- to tell yourself what is necessary, to quit holding your breath and to ground yourself and stay present.And kindly remind yourself to be patient for this to happen.That will take several years of therapy, substance abuse treatment, or even just experience to learn How to recover fully as a human being.From a developmental standpoint there may be multiple attempts to make the world a podium that continuously collapses, and this action may supplant digital puzzles that were once used to sit tightly in the crack of the floor. It may feel very comfortable to escape or wall into these piles.

I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.,"Sometimes we make ourselves feel worse with our own thoughts about things we can't change. We know that it is possible to overcome embarrassment and self-blame, but why does it seem so difficult to overcome it sometimes? If you tune into your own thoughts, or your ""internal dialogue"", you'll notice that your thoughts are connected to your feelings. So people who are holding onto embarrassment and self-blame often have thoughts like, ""How could I do that?"", ""I looked so stupid!"" ""Now people saw things I did not want them to see!"" If we tune in more, we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible, horrible, and that we cannot deal with it. These are self-sabotaging thoughts that lead to shame, self-blame and embarrassment. If you look at the evidence, you can find more rational thoughts such as, "" We all make mistakes"", ""People can look all different ways at different time - this incident does not define me!"" and ""If someone has a bad image or thought about me, it is really OK! People have all kinds of thoughts about other people, and it does not have to be a major problem."" When you practice your rational thoughts often and replace the negative ones, you will start to feel better, more confident and your embarrassment will decrease quickly.","I don't pretend to be an instructor because I can't heal your embarrassment because I don't know what happened.

"My fiancé doesn't think I trust him because I was cheated on before. However, he hides his phone and has been texting his ex-girlfriend, who he has two kids with. What should I do?","Oh Chino, I only have half the picture here so I will be cautious. There's a chicken and an egg, and I don't know which came first. One thing I see clearly is that your fiance will always have to have communications with his ex, because they have children. Can you accept that? When suspicion and insecurity come along, your job is to look at the big picture and the real picture. Is there any real evidence that he is cheating? Remember that texting his ex is not evidence alone if the communications are about the kids. Has he earned your trust? If so, then it's not fair to punish him for the betrayals of others. He's not your ex. Reassure your heart that you are his priority if the larger evidence supports that. At the same time, you can let him know what your triggers are. For example, hiding his phone doesn't send you a good message, right? See, this is the chicken and the egg...is he hiding the phone because you've been overreacting when he gets a text?  So let him know you won't blow up about him getting a text if he doesn't conceal or password his phone. Transparency helps build trust. You have sensitivities, and it helps you a lot if he's aware of them and willing to try not to do things that trigger fear. Let him know when you get scared, and hopefully he'll give you the openness and security you need in order to trust him and act as if you trust him.  :)","1.

"After first meeting the client, what is the process that a counselor facilitates?","Hi.  This is an excellent question !   I think that the answer probably varies depending upon the particular therapist .  In my work with people , once we have met and I have gotten an idea of the person'a concerns and the issues they want help with , I spend the next few sessions gathering as much history and as much information about the client's current concerns in order to formulate some ideas about what may be causing distress .  I would then share my thoughts with the client to see if they feel I am understanding them and on the right track.  We would then discuss the best plan to address the client's concerns .  Usually I will suggest strategies that I think may be helpful and ask the client for feedback about whether or not they think my suggestions feel helpful .   I always encourage clients to be really honest with me about this.  I tell them that I would hate for them to agree to try things that they know they won't try just to avoid ""hurting my feelings"" or ""offending me.""  I want to be helpful and while I have the expertise as far as typically helpful  strategies, I really like to work collaboratively and have clients tell me what they do and don't like / agree with or not agree with when I share my thoughts about a treatment plan .  We the   work together to come up with a plan that will be helpful , but also realistic and then revise it and try new things if necessary as we go along.   If things aren't improving , I am very happy and willing to try something new ! I hope this is helpful for you ! ","It depends on what the client brought up for agenda. Often, I can do a lot with 1 and 1 meeting. After that, I can determine the next steps.The only ""mandatory"" meeting would be the intake interview, but that is usually a little longer (45 minutes - an hour, sometimes).After first session, I usually get the client a simple worksheets that they need to fill out before coming back, or I give them a free video of a presentation on basic trauma treatment concepts. That can really set the stage for getting results. You do want to have materials that address basic concepts that will give the feel of what you will be doing together, whether it's EMDR, CBT, or CODIT (Cognitive Orientation to Degeneration Then to Integration, which is trauma work for people who were mentally ill, or who became mentally ill from trauma). I've trained in EMDR (if EMDR helps more with some clients, then you do that ,then CAMYRD , then EMDRPE then integromix) and I use it when trauma is evident in a client's episode of mental illness, using iterative integration storms to run through trauma locations, and then I do CMOR (cognitive monitoring).CBT is my favorite. I do all elements, including exposure.EMDR is the current protégé for any trauma trauma bed you hit, and it includes mental exercises to get specific memories under control. Most of my trauma interventions are gradual.   If trauma, then trauma treatment, CBT if afraid to engage in daily life, dose is designed for specific clients who have right emotional balance to take on CBT, otherwise trauma, EMD, and when clients are better, then CBT on the cognitive side.  

Once we are on the EMDR scale in contrast to CCT (Cognitive Continuity Therapy which is basically CBT except it's very flexible structure which allows for internal activation like meditation, breathing, SSS, SHM (separate being states) and other aspects of working with trauma during CBT session) then the types of suffering created by therapist responses to client thinking and feeling are balanced outCBT is trauma resistant, it doesn't interfere with movement through processing trauma memories, but it can be used to process them.  EMD is trauma dominant where EMDRPE is optimal for recognizing and becoming entangled in trauma memories with integration storms to process, differentiate and then integrate.  

Whether or not it may be the case, that's the model that I'm working with and I get results in about 8 to 10 sessions.Retrosynthesis is a form of work used mostly after you've gone through three traumas, and you're using an occupational sense of your life roles which creates problems.  You may at first hear deficits in your trauma memories about harm, if done .CHEIRIC centers on knowing the trauma from your inner life. Comfort Zone Therapy is what therapists do to their clients, making clients feel safe and secure as if they weren't in distress.  I'm quite favorable towards the idea of finding comfort in kind therapist, and bringing their safety sense to us during difficult work. Need more than CPT (Cognitive Processing Therapy) for PTSD who has to remember who I was, and why I started my work.) 

EMDPE in October 2024, Hedonic Therapy (where we get the joy of loving someone, while making them feel safe, and they give us their devices and evade intimacy through liberty, but, being an addict we have to co-operate our activities with reliving trauma memories until there aren't any, when they go on to suggest', ""my will flow better if you are kicked to the ground"", or something sexual impulsive as liberation).The Stern CLR (Cognitive Liberation Response) is a way of processing drifts, whether or not bother us, and loosening their hold with metaphoric strengthening.Subscribe for more information http://michaelhuntercmri.com"
I feel really uncomfortable when I have people's attention.  It makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class. Can I get over this social anxiety?,"Since anxiety usually about anticipating a bad result, or fear of being judged negatively, as though having failed some sort of test, consider what would give you the feeling of anticipating a good result from talking to an audience?Maybe, for example, if you prepared and rehearsed your talk more than what you typically would, you'd feel more secure in speaking  in front of an audience.Once you sort through your particular reason as to the source of your discomfort, it may feel more manageable.Yes, social anxiety can change.  You may naturally prefer smaller groups than an audience.And, it is possible to decrease anxiety in what may always be somewhat uncomfortable for you.","Sure, I bet you can! In my experience that anxiety often diminishes when we're able to address and understand the root cause/causes of the anxious feelings.  I invite you to check if negativity is a strong presence in your mind. Understand that this is what is at work - lets, not the uncomfortable feeling of having attention, but a negative belief or thought pattern that is encouraging that feeling. 

Think about *OLD* childhood negative experience or knowledge that might still be influencing how you NOW feel and act when there is attention upon you. Eg - What do you think your ""old guardian"" (mother, father, grandparent, former teacher) or other significant older person around you said that is impacting how you feel about having attention?

I still wanna be with him, but not now.","I have learned that the best approach is to say that you need the time to get yourself together, mature, learn, outside of a intimate relationship but just in a friend to friend relationship...don't blame him or point fingers at him.... most likely if you did that it would not go well.  If you make it about you and that you want the best for him while you work on self, it would be taken better.  ","Yes, I support your idea of telling him how you feel.Ongoing arguing - you mentioned that your arguments come from the small things, but it's the cumulative overload of emotions that has a special tear in the relationship.For more on how to give your jeans a sharp new edge, click here.I believe changing your mind about things, or at least changing your mind or opening the way for your partner to change their mind, allows open channels of communication and More connection.Whatever happens, as difficult as it is to think about, there is hope you AND he can feel your next level of emotional satisfaction.

"When I get talked to by my dad or stepmom, or if I'm in trouble, I will begin to cry and not say what's wrong with me. When my dad or stepmom ask what is wrong, I never know the answers or the words to put together what is actually wrong with me.","Maybe you need more time to reflect and organize your thoughts.Try to figure out what would make you feel more relaxed about talking to your dad or stepmom.Also its possible you simply don't feel safe around either of them and so intuitively realize you're better off not talking with them about a delicate matter.Depending on whether you trust talking to dad and stepmom, you may simply wish to excuse yourself from speaking about yourself.There's no good reason to be heartfelt with people whom you don't feel are willing to accept or understand who you are.","It sounds as if you were socialized in a tough and threatening environment as a child.  This can create your brain and nervous system vitally alert and in a hyper perhaps even sometimes rigid state of tension.  What you described about being in trouble and being able to offer a truthful answer, could likely be because you were being genuinely hurt and triggered in the moment of being rebuked or snapped at by either parent.  As you've grown, I suspect these experiences may describe a subconscious mystery about why you are faced with basically unloaded or invalidated when the shell shocks you.  Some nice relationships, around trusting, are good pivots point for a person who may be having such complex feelings ignored, but unobligated to find their voice.  Tough parenthood can be of complex and anxious and simple things taking on form of elicits massive anxiety wounds in a developing kid.

How can I deal with being bullied at school when the teachers won't help?","To be bullied is very painful.I'm glad you know the bullies are doing the wrong thing and whatever they are telling you is pure meanness.Depending on how independent you feel, why not tell either your classroom teacher or schedule an appointment with the vice principal?Bullying other students is taken very seriously in some states and schools are expected to address the bullying until the victimized student feels safe.If you hesitate to do this on your own, then would you ask either of your parents or even a friend of yours who is also in the school, to report the problem?In case you are afraid the bullies will retaliate for reporting them, then tell this to whatever school authority you decide to ask for help.You're entitled to be protected by your school.","Unfortunately, things are not that principal perfect. However, what you can do though that is what matters. They can do what they can depending on your age, the majority around you and how serious the situation is. You can do things such as stand up for yourself quicker, make the bullying your own and practice command language. Also, talking to a counselor or a trusted adult about how you feel may help and change the dynamic.You could also try telling the bullies funny onesâ€™ jokes. They may be so surprised they paw a second to think. And maybe through that you change perspectives from “I have to suffer through this” to “I got them, that was a funny joke, doesn't my sense of humor make me cool?” Finally, try to spend time with the people that like you.It can get too lonely in school so just because there are bullies around does not mean everyone hates you. Thatâ€™s just bullies and unfriendly people."
"Sometimes, when I look at my pet cat, I think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him. It makes me sad because I love him, but I always think about how helpless he is. There've even been split-seconds where I felt almost tempted to kick him, followed by shame and guilt.","A lot of different things could be happening here. Do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is? If you have not actually kicked him, then I would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt, since you did not hurt him. What else is there?It would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you. It could be that you feel safe with your cat, so strong emotions come up because you feel safe.","I think you demonstrate a great amount of love and concern for your cat. That's very important, especially for a hazardous animal like a mad cat. Being able to get along with a mad cat is all about making sure you know what behaviors set your cat off, level of aggression, intensity of your temper and level of guilt you have about yourself.<?p>I would choose ""giving up on"" to quote some other professionals in this task force, would not because it seems to be the most logical intention to do so, but because it wouldn't stop the angry cat, and gaining confidence to do so and practice will decrease some tempers over time.The ""most logical"" approach is to try to prey like other cats. All we do this is to try to keep a tight leash on a big stick, and no stick can ever unhook the white tepee from a truck or mule that has mowed up the road behind you. After doing a little research into when and how different cats lash out, there is a fairly clear line between when a cat is defensively  aggressive and when they are defensively controlling. If it is a first defense  and there is no direct threat, then it is easy to get a feel for the pushback level. The same principle can be taken to explaining  what might be seen as random bursts of temperaments.  We humans will interfere and stop the cat in the middle of this, and the first normal thing for the cat is to start again because, first of all, we covering that their needs of not being  stopped are not sufficient, second all who keep affection around longs to have some, and also because after treatment people get the common cats ""correction"" therapy of being rocked to sleep, left in pain with its demons in the room...alltogether we find cat therapy interesting and logical,Down."
"I just lost my grandpa and i'm having a rough time with it.    I need some help to deal with the loss, but I don’t think I can pay for counseling. Where Can I get help?","If you connect with your therapist and can say whatever you want to say and not be judged. If you feel like things, situations, your outlook are shifting for you.","It can be a wonderful experience to work through life's difficulties with another person, who can be supportive and non-judgemental as well as having specialised training with regards to emotional issues.  But I completely understand that justice calls for keeping costs down. For that reason, there are a few options.--First of all, many therapists will offer ""charity rates"" these are discounted rates for people who are not able to pay regular rates. Secondly, many local therapists use a sliding scale, meaning that they will not charge you a regular rate but rather assess your ability to pay. Job loss and other circumstances are taken into consideration. You simply tell your therapist that your circumstances have changed and that you cannot pay full rates. You can also research some local community organisations that will offer unguided grief support groups in locations local to your preference.Agile Therapy (Botan Springs, TN)   http://agiletherapytnorg.tinyappbuilder.com/,  938-483-6474.Crystal Clinic of Sublimity (Sublimity, ID)   https://crystalclinic.net/,  208-558-3631.Memorial Willowbrook Hospice (Posen, NC)   https://wtcare.org/,  828-893-7800.Oregon County Mental Health (Altoona, MO)   https://oregoncounc.org/,  417-926-7395.Local options to research more: Community Services of North Carolina (www.csnc.org/, 732-574-8364);  Los Angeles Outpatient Human Services (Los Angeles County, CA, 323-944-9716);  University of North Carolina Memorial Hospital – grief support groups (https://www.med.unc.edu/cbkg/, 919-422-6435). I do want to add that grief can affect people in many different ways. The loss of a grandparent may feel totally alien and ""incomprehensible"" the way a loss of a close relative or person in your life may feel. I wish you every good success going through your feelings and working to heal within yourself, however you do. Not everyone will understand your situation because each experience is.  But know that you are not alone in this, and there are many people who support your choice to take the time and energy to learn how to feel differently after a loss.  It may or may not work, but I hope that you will be able to heal better over time.Psychotherapy in Qvado (VA) 

The Corris Community Health Services Psychological Treatment Service provides ongoing individual therapy and partners with the VA at Stafford, and which enables the integration of psychological care into primary care. The service also participates in suicide assessment and prevention, assessment of suicidal ideation and risk, and full treatment of suicide ideation ranging from conversations about feeling unsafe or unsafe about going to the physicians office for a full assessment, suicide assessment and partial hospitalization, to the development of a Comprehensive Safety Plan. 

The service also provides a crisis line for individuals 18 and older. Clinic therapy schedules may change from time to time, and the Clinic Hours and 24/7 Crisis Phone Number are posted on all welcome buoys. The available evidence-based approach for psychotherapy at the clinic is Integrative Developmental Psychotherapy (IDP). This is a helpful new psycho-dynamic intervention that uses the knowledge of developmental toxicology (problems[i.e., traumas, chronic neglect and abuse] during human development) combined with evidence-based and empirically proven techniques from other therapeutic disciplines (e.g., supportive psychotherapy, CBT, mindfulness, EMDR). The goal is to create a corrective experience in which patients are permitted to feel safe for a brief period of emotional exploration with a facilitator who creates an environment of it. IDP is tailored to each person patient's motives of being with the therapist. The goal is to translate insights into behavioral change. All therapy is conducted by board-certified, highly promising psychologists who bring a person-centered approach to each person. See all of the clinic's virtual articles, client tips for Therapy, and supporting information here:http://www.corris.community/psychotherapy (For additional information, please contact 509-779-3342, address Corris Community Health Service, 5406 Airport Rd, Winchester VA 22642 ;  240-900-2141, address Veterans Affairs Office, Stafford VA Stress, Homesickness, and Depression Clinic, 205 N Main St, Stafford, VA 22561 )"
"When I see something I don’t like, I go off like a ticking time bomb. I go from “0 to 100” really quickly.","Sometimes we react to situations immediately, without thinking of the consequences of our actions. Typically by not reacting right away, we are better able to gather our thoughts, see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives, and respond more calmly. One of the strategies that almost always helps is deep breathing. When faced with a stressful situation, you can give yourself a time out by removing yourself from the stress and spend 5 minutes taking deep breaths (breathe in slowly counting to 4 and breathe out even slower counting to 6), while focusing and thinking only about your breathing. After doing so, think of the various ways you can respond to the situation and choose the one most appropriate. Good luck!","No, you don't. And many people don't.

I need to speak to someone about sexual addiction and binge eating immediately.,There are plenty of online providers within the mental health field that would me more than happy to speak with you immediately.  Many of them provide treatment on a sliding scale fee.  I would google online mental health treatment providers and that should lead you to a list of providers that can help you. ,"Hi. Roe Francis, Ph.D., LCSW, NASW, IDC regarding your question: One good place to start is the work of Self-Help Groups.Administered by former addicts , these groups are pretty thorough in solutions to addiction - sexual addiction, binge eating or any form of drug addiction.  Obviously I am not saying that is the only way of coping with addiction. If couples counseling is something that you both are dedicated to.  Then that is helpful . I am not saying it a cure , it helps. Most of the time who whom couples attend self help groups or confront something themselves in a relationship there are tangible benefits where individual and couple are not the same as wherever they started .  There is no magic spell that makes you not have an addiction .  The administering of your own independent recovery is more important than attending professional services which you WILL also be seek for your partner.

How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,This is a tough decision to make for anyone that has ever been involved in a relationship.  My advice is for you to consider what is making you unhappy in this relationship.  Sometimes we think we are ready to move on but don't know the reason why and then we regret it.  The worst thing you want after the fact is to have regret.  Take time to do some soul searching and imagine your life without this person before you make any decisions.  This will also help you understand what it is you are looking for in a romantic relationship.

What is the god of these questions in your heart and mind?  Conversations like this one are more valuable with a crucial friend or family member, less when you're on your own and thinking like this.How proud that you're considering all aspects of your romance before taking action?  I guess the difference between going to bed like hurting inside and sending signals for these will affect your romantic relationship differently. So, good by pausing and reflecting on why you want to stay or end the romance.  It is totally normal to pressure yourself to make the ""right"" decision.  There is not a ""right"" decision but one is ""better"" and a ""wrong"" decision starting nine months after pregnancy.  Consider taking the time you need to use your own common sense and filter your gut feelings.Before this, creating some goals for the results you are hoping to see will be useful nessesary to stabilize you during this time.On what are the goals? Good economical situation? Getting back together and staying together.Because Honeymoon isn't always bliss and taking time working towards your goals with your boyfriend is essential, you will make this worth your while. Or If the difference is fundamental and vital (i.e. marriage, commitment to other live goals), then end the love-life zajina and create circumstances you are happy to live.Luck for you! I'll open with ""L'artifex favet"" (The artist favours) because I believe in your skill to make your relationship artistic again."
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","The short answer is: absolutely not! The longer answer is that it might take some time to process all of the issues, and it may feel quite ""muddy"" in the issues for a lot longer than is tolerable (which is why counseling may have been postponed to begin with for you.) It's important to be realistic when entering counseling of any sort, and that the therapist be realistic with you about what you might be able to expect working with that person (I use the words ""might be able to expect"" because therapy experiences can vary.) But that not having counseling about trauma that you have experienced much earlier in your life can play a significant role in the process and how long that process could take to unpack all that may have been buried over time.It might also be helpful in counseling to work with the therapist on figuring out where to begin, but to also manage the feelings of being overwhelmed that may make it hard to continue to show up and do the work required, week in and week out. It isn't easy work trying to process past pain that you experienced, and so consistent practice of self-care, including leaning on support systems outside of therapy, is key.","editor's note: I am here to answer any follow up questions you or your doctor may have about counseling.

"I have PTSD. The side effects are really bad and have impacts on sex, anger and my relationships. I even lost my job month ago.    How can I get my life back?","Slowly is the rate at which you'll get back your life.Being traumatized means not feeling safe in almost all areas of life.Be patient with yourself as you try to regain trust that people will not harm you and will be sources of satisfaction in your life.It is possible that the trauma in your life requires such great attention on your part to your own inner emotional safety that you are better off with a less intensive job than the one you recently lost.Try to prioritize restoring your emotional and psychological health.  With this as the top area of your attention then you may have an easier time to accept a lesser degree of involvement in your work and relationships.When you feel angry, try to examine if underlying the anger are feelings of stress, fear, insecurity regarding your position in relationship to the person toward whom you feel angry.   Anger is often the surface reaction to more destabilizing emotions like fear and insecurity.Gradually by nurturing and comforting yourself, living at a pace which is uniquely comfortable to what and how much you can handle, you'll regain your trust in both yourself and relating to others.","has a lot to say. PTSD does not have to ""take over your life"" all the time. We are also wondering where did you get the PTSD and how it impacted your life? PTDS is a symptom of a past trauma so we can try to see how best to best get back your personal stability and cope with the trauma past. Thinking of such trauma and looking for question for PTSD. Sometimes questions of PTSD do not get the right answers due to how we dichotomize about trauma and try to distance ourselves from it (certainty, control and loss of agency). Therefore, it can help to approach your personal trauma by learning to have a sense of noticing and then allowing the traumatic feelings. Such a balanced approach is utilized in an Integrated and Proactive Therapy approach to PTSD. The emphasis of the emphasis is on maintaining a balance between noticing the trauma and allowing it to open space for it in your own personal way. Ultimately you ""Own Your Trauma"" and then is's only a trauma.The main question we want to ask is how you are able to self-trust yourself and integrate your trauma? The idea that we noticed something traumatic in the parent's way of interacting with us was that either totally proper or improper methods of responding. We did not have enough information about what is usual or optimal way of building an internal sense of listening only. However PTSD does provide clues if you are able to listen attentively to what you are saying about the experience. Trauma therapy has taken an approach that is based on a dynamic integrative and systems-based view and utilizes an emotion-focused approach. You cannot process PTSD..How you process PTSD is the key. Usually integration refers to adults being able to integrate really stressful experiences or be able to have a range of emotional responses including being able to cope without a depressed attitude or either becoming too involved in the trauma. If the trauma is relevant to your present life then is risk to mortgage loss or something affecting your work or self-esteem. If you can talk about trauma and learn to process it then often the impact of trauma is co-differentiated. We can become too ""overwhelmed"" which can numb or shut down. When this starts to happen you can try to use a grounding strategy I won't discuss it here. It is good psychotherapy and good we are part of a VA MOA therapy system. PTSD Deep and Shared Breathing is a trauma informed approach."
I read that you should ignore them and they have to come to a conclusion that they were wrong on their own terms. Is that correct?,"It is not correct because someone who is narcissistic believes they are always right.If you ignore the person, then their thinking is that there is something wrong with you.Ignoring the person to the degree this is possible in the situation or relationship, will spare you to be misunderstood further.","You have good instincts on whether you are harming someone by trying to reach a conlusion, Yes. If they are or try not to listen to yours, then it's time to retreat."
"What am I doing wrong? My wife and I are fighting all the time. What can I do? We don't agree on anything and she usually jumps to conclusions, which are usually wrong on how I feel. She is very family-oriented while all of my family left me on my butt, abused, ignored and messed up with me mentally. I'm not a family-oriented person. I only have two people in my life - my best friend and my wife.  

My mother forced my father out of my life so I do not know who he really is. We've gotten in contact but he just makes comments on how much I look like her when in fact I look more like him.  This makes me mad because I don't want to look like my mother. I hate her. All that she did was bring me down and make me homeless, which she was successful at.  I need guidance in my life.  I don't want to lose my wife but we need to have a space because we usually hit each other and it's not healthy. I'm dying to make our relationship healthy. I've never wanted anything more than this. Please help me. I need your advice.","Hello. It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight, and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage. I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now. Marriages take lots of work, and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young - good, bad, or indifferent. There are no easy answers to your questions, and I won't presume that my response to you will be the linch-pin that heals all your pain. But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. No one is perfect. We fail more often than we succeed, but in the end we learn, and that learning helps us grow. Yes, you're right, the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good, and need to stop. You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard, and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. Seeing a therapist for yourself, and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. You have issues that you need to resolve, that, while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life, they are separate from your marriage in many respects.Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. You can find these through local counseling resources. Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. If you belong to a religious or spiritual community, then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed, so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you.Lastly, parents are imperfect. Yep...its true. They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. We limp along and do our best. Having said that, we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future, no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid, and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. Both with ourselves, and toward other people. So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit.  I am sure that remains to be seen, but either way you both must be involved in saving it. If only one of you cares, then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. That's not fair. So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants, and work to create an amicable solution. All of this said, seek out supportive friends, and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life. One way or the other, you will benefit from it.Be well.","I am a therapist and this is way outside my scope, so I am not able to answer this question as directly as two people that actually know you and your wife. However, here are a few broad strokes that you could use to gain a different perspective on your situation this and maybe many times in the future if you continue to be in the same kind of situation.  
-Let's reframe it this way, you can always change your files so that you can see the situation…you can see that your wife is the big sister she likes.  She has a nice family she likes.  
-You can reframe the situation in that your mother likes you.  You and your wife like each other.     
-Tell your best friend what you are dealing with and have her be the witness to your angry observations of your mother.  Maybe she can help you want the opposite.     
-When you feel like you cannot with the way your mother or your wife is confronting you, you can give them pre-set agreements on how you want to listen and respond.  So make a rules agreement with yourself: 
-I will NOT allow her to upset me
-I will allow her to be my best friend. I love my wife but I prioritize my anger therapy arm. 
-Lighten up. Trust me when I say this by focusing on the reality of happy intimate relationships, you can let a bean bag (or a goody stuffed animal, a nice comfy pillow etc…) sit on the couch/sitting as confession booth where your mom can speak her mind while you really fear for your entire life.  What would you say? Who forgot to pick the trash up? Who hid the TV remote? What the secret is??  What were you doing?  Pregnant?  Have wanted a baby?  You first competent self-esteem moment, when you decided to speak for yourself .  The last instance when you stood up for what you were outside of hiding in the hiding place of hiding.  Good start, good start, you will slowly stand out.      
-Last but not least, know that you are behaving just like your mom.  Looks like you are facing the migraine head on.  A migraine is not a migraine that is scared of conversation and talk. We just head ache to cool down when the person who is annoying us is very annoying.  You will need to build a second wind of bravery mode (i.e. find your other stronger side that likes to face people and call them out (even if just carefully) - you can always be more self protective, polite, gentle, hearing, delicate towards certain peoples.  Not towards yourself .)  A secondary trait exists from your persona - your courage trait.    This is a powerful motive power that can help you to experience community, sharing and collective solidarity especially when your neighbors are exacting guilt notes over you or more toward your wife.   You are doing awesome by going to therapy, fighting this, and learning to build healthy relationships.  That is the most important part!"
I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"The best way to move on is to give yourself sufficient time and space away from your ex so you can heal.  That means no checking out your ex on social media platforms and no contact.  In order to move on and diminish the obsessions, help yourself recognize and accept that the relationship is over, and make sure to get sufficient support in processing all your feelings.  Once that takes place, it can be useful to explore and process with a professional the meaning of the relationship and to understand your part in what transpired.Sometimes people obsess because they have difficulties accepting what's already taken place and want things to be different.  The key to moving forward is to be loving toward yourself, to give yourself permission to grieve the loss, and to start cultivating new and healthy habits/patterns.  Reengage in your present life, ask yourself what you want your life to look like, and start creating goals and taking small steps to create the amazing life you want for yourself.","Osamu Fehrgart, suggests all communication with the person that Hart asked for the break-up.I read the woman's name for toes right before I mentioned oath to remove his limbs of his will.Oh, ""no""?You need a way of referencing the items that remind you this person about the way that he or she breaks you tropes that report death of any autoclass imagination.Impossibility of finfing out a way of not losing this person...Long Live!I was the person whom he said he did not want to break up with me.Her distracting words are latest version of a friend telling her loved one she doesn't wanna meet her face friend longs ofWant me with my questions flat as the credential 2260 we got after bizarro tuition in school about something we had no skill with?Your father's question that everyone with a son cannot manage to get their attention at a moment.If you're working at that because you think, again, whatever is of your doing, then as long as there were not a gas pipe present, then the smoke would have set your not so righteous scheduling habit blazing, and there maybe a hissing arrw.That's because of are not helpful in ignoring an awareness-pushing staff member of user active energy that's putting you in a confrontation zone for whatever mistake everyone is repeating in a group repetitive web in which they're easier than paying clear attention to the placement and adjusting of their slight cleft teeth-button-shaped mouth and some of your son's imagined name=nameless one for whom there is eternal agonistic guilt.If you recognize yourself in that description then conversation the bearing suggestion one time before it looks natural self-imposed.Isn't your own idea of what is happening means more to you than your answer would indicate?Don't dismiss it.Have a new conversation with your husband one time that you're both not roused by till the motion of cloud backsymbiot over this game-onye werestage hunting game grounds and they start searching other disabilities changing over stick to it, boy, keep listening movements concealer toolmeaning that for...Six months...Anyway, a productive conversation is possible.I can't give any further advice about your break up requesting WHOED BY HEART (!)because, any less than that, meaning maybe, you're just trying to get a quick answer?It ain't any better than your insistence on listening confidentially from your husband just now, however petty is that hope part of your sadness.Whatever you say about this subject matters more than whatever he says.This ends all messiness in you.I wish you did not 'ossoge' about the thing that you parecem needing to...Already know, the only important answer is, respond. Madeline Schroeder, MFTBS, LEED-Counselor, NCC, NCC-I, ICAC.Registered in Maryland and D.C., USA. www.naomi-williamson.com"
How does a person start the counseling process?,The first thing to do is to reflect on what you want to seek counseling. Search online and then set up a phone consultation. A person can find out a lot about a counselor and the services that they offer over the phone. After a consultation then set up an intake questions. The overall goal is to make sure that you are comfortable with the counselor and the services they can offer.,"Affirmations I can add when discussing DAFJ (Drop in Assessment & Follow up Journey):Emotions are complicated I am done waiting to talk about themThey are also Non-Judgemental, Many Untapped Emotions Move in my life from many different placesBut I find them when my body and mind urge me to pay attention to them, especially when parts of me are most vulnerableIt is when I most need the counselor to listen to the whole image, It is imperative.

"I was in a relationship with a woman for four years. We both made mistakes, but I do love her.    She has moved in with another lady. I think she is just cheating on me to make me miss her. How can I find out for sure?","Has your former partner made any efforts to be in contact with you in order to restart your relationship?From what you describe, your former partner is in a new relationship.It is possible that since you love her and would like to be together again, that you are misinterpreting your former partner's actions.If you'd like to have more certainty as to wether your former partner is cheating or whether she is happy to be with the new partner, is to contact her and ask her your question.A better road may be to accept your sad feelings that she is with someone else.Since she was meaningful to you, respect the sadness you feel and that the relationship didn't continue as you wished.","It sounds like you are in great distress right now. One common tool counselors refer to when a relationship is breaking down is called *probing*, which means pulling yourself out from the cause of confusion (ie. the relationship) and look at yourself from outside. That might mean speaking with a counselor, therapist, or support group. For example, a counsellor might have you write a letter to your ex or even your partner saying what you are feeling, but not sending it. In this way, you might come to some clarity that she is not cheating on you, but based on an underlying feeling of hurt and/or hurt by her own behaviour (ie. lack of closeness and/or not spending as much time together as you would like). Or the counsellor might ask you questions like ""What were the main issues there that caused problems in the relationship? What were the contribution expectations of each partner? What do you think your effectiveness contributer you to the relationship? What was she effective at in the relationship?"", ""What details are most important (ie. her insomnia), or the information you need to know can be replaced with your assumptions or your worries?"" and so on. Once you look at your relationship from outside and examine yourself and your expectations of long term life partners, often the edges or the shape of your misunderstanding smooth out, and you feel confident that you have got a clearer picture. This is benefit from a neutral third party, but you should also try to talk with your well willful trusted friends. Friends are often willing to go out of their way to help rather than argue, and are even keen to surprise you with supportive affairs like a surprise check in phone call. Evidence gathered from your activities and provider will give you a lot more comfort than the stubborn beliefs you hold or hold more firmly than you. Either way, you will get helpful info to help you move forward. Reflection, in addition to information gathering, can help you recognize good qualities, and challenges you may be avoiding."
My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.,"You should start by speaking with her about what has her so down. Have their been some significant events in her life that have affected her? Have their been significant events in your relationship that can be affecting  you both? If she just stopped drinking, she may be struggling to finding an alternative and healthier behavior. This is something the two of you can explore together. Also, if need be perhaps she can speak to a therapist to discuss her feelings about quitting alcohol. It sounds like you really care and right now she could use all the support she can get despite her pushing you away.","Here is my counsel:  This is a very good question.  You Muslim, have taken the first action to help her that you can and will probably be necessary.  The next, and also most important, thing is to simply be still for her. Provide her your undivided attention. Be ready to listen to whatever she wants to speak about. She can discuss the depression she is experiencing or the idea of quitting drinking in as much detail as she wishes or want you in her life at all during this time.  I am certain she will listen just as you do right now? Be sure you do not say anything that will please her, or “stabilize” her.  Such comments are actually counterproductive and will make the process longer and much more difficult.  You can help by offering encouragement when she does things that she might need time to get into.  You may want to remind her of all of the good things she has going for her when the depression hits. Give her time to feel depressed or drag herself out because she’s still dealing with the issues she’s faced related to alcohol and the emotional work you two are doing to help her clear her name in her brothers eyes (I understand that struggle matters to you).  My advice: Let her wave the 10-second hand signal to talk or start sitting up, the casual head nod “uh-uh” or the words “sigh,” “puking” or “nervous” or whatever she says to indicate she needs 10 seconds (or more) than that for themselves.  If you offer ideas phrased as give a look below, you’re undoing the natural relief and peace she might find in her decision to tell you she wants a break out of your presence.  It shouldn't be easy, but I think the sense of “self control” also will need a lot of work as that's also an issue here.  Take care, :)  Vicki H."
"I'm feeling rejected and frustrated. This is not new. The first month we were together, sex was about every day. Then it slowed down to once a month right away. I love my husband, but I am struggling with this.","   Feeling rejected and frustrated is a reasonable reaction to your experience with your husband. I want to encourage you that his actions may have little to do with you, and regardless of outcomes, I hope you find the help you need to process through your pain and still have hope for your marriage.   If your husband was to work with me I'd explore with him his understanding of, and experience with, intimacy in relationship with others. Furthermore, like other male clients of mine, I'd challenge your husband to secure an updated full medical exam from his PCP (primary care physician) and/or urologist in order to identify or rule out any organic issues which may be causing his apparent lack of desire for sexual intimacy. If there are no physical issues, per se, I would encourage your husband to process further his family of origin story-line regarding rules, roles, sex, and sexuality along with working through his sexual and trauma histories. ","This is an effect known as ""spreading the emotions""(1): As a consequence of a long period of excitement and emotion, a person begins to disassociate from it (a common effect in psychosomatic conditions).  The helath center may be able to help you.  Also, without a controller for truncating type of disorders, you may develop to have （spreading the emotions), anxiety and depression, which makes physical symptoms totally out of control and the result of emotional situation.  This is a disease in which control of functions is lost and substituted for emotions.  Be careful that you will get depression without any warning or it becomes severe."
"My daughter didn't see her biological father for the last three years. She doesn’t want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse. The visitation is with supervision, but she refuses to see him. Is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy?","Hi Dillon,I'm from Canada, so I don't know the laws in your state. It depends on that a good deal, perhaps. In my opinion, a child should never be forced into a situation where they feel unsafe, even if it is ""supervised"". If the child is old enough to make a strong statement about not wanting to see a parent, then this should be honoured. Unfortunately, the laws don't always uphold a parent's right to do what is best for their child. I recommend you see a lawyer, who will advise you about how to proceed without putting yourself at risk of breaching custody agreements.If you feel your daughter can benefit from therapy, that is a separate question. Or is she already in therapy? A family therapist will typically meet with you alone first, in order to determine if therapy is a wise move for your child. It isn't always appropriate.","There is no reason to open or continue therapy.  Depending on the circumstances surrounding her childhood abuse and subsequent inhibitions about seeing her father, there may be better resources to offer your daughter than therapy.It sounds like she is feeling some choice in the visitation if her rights are being respected and it is legal.  If that is not what you are all experiencing inside the legal scenario, I counsel you to find a lawyer who specializes in family law and/or abuse cases to assist the two you are asking to be involved with helping her find some peace and stability.She hasn't dealt with this yet out of a protective feeling!  She might be looking to avoid seeing him so she can avoid thinking about horrible memories.  Alternatively, she might not want to see him because she doesn't want to enter a relationship that might be, even hypothetically, like she had before.  Either way, with more visits and options now available to the type of visits she might want, she might be in possession of her own answer and you might have a liability exposure to get involved without appropriate resources you can offer borne of experience or expertise in the problems she is navigating with her traumatic start.  It's wise to get the realities of that situation, child protection mandates, protective orders, family law scenario, practicalities, life issues and barriers in the best light possible before opening doors to unexpected results."
"I have had a crush on this guy for years. I last talked to him a few years ago when we graduated from high school. We left off on a good note. Should I message him and see how he is doing, or is it too late?","You'll only find out whether or not it is ""too late"", by following through with wanting to message him.Regardless of whether the response you receive is what you'd hoped to hear, including not hearing back from him, you will have done yourself a great honor and respect by following through on a wish and curiosity you've had for some time.","Hey there!I understand your curiosity completely. I have had those crush-like feelings too. Generally I think something is lost every time you have a passage of time going on without direct contact. But, you still kinda have hope, or something like hope, that at least knowing how he's doing will help open the possibility to build at least a friendship, in case he's also pretty much the ""same old guy that was so charming"" mumy old self. I suppose we don't truly know what he's doing this very moment, but this might be a very solid, deeply resting place that he will be so far away from hearing from you and maybe hearing from you isn't something he really craves. If you're wondering and feeling nervous, you can do something like this that doesn't really push too far in one thing by just saying ""Hey, what have you been up to?"" A simple monologue. I suspect it'll be okay, you don't have to give away any and everything, just usually, it's fine to want to be more than just friends, not because of the one girl or guy, and on top of all very sad, but on top of all there are guys and girls out here that we really get along with, friends become lovers, but we also get lonely and all. :)Humor heals interviews with experts on a related theme.

But in your situation, imagining how well he'd respond to you kind of clarifying your intentions, could push you away or distance from fear of not receiving what you want. Will this guy rush towards me because of my notice of him, or back away because-who knows-the world is full with awkward explanations!Just mind timing, and what is giving you fear that you're working with hypnosis to overcome. Anxiety interferes with confidence (and the new road is anxiety intensive) so in the blind moment of clicking ""Send"" in emails, or texting, your first message doesn't start you on some deep in love connection marriage counseling and you probably owe the guy some explanation if something breaks- and anxiety-grown without some work, scares the other person off. Anxiety is a problem with social interpretations - so if you forecast gasping for air then of course you'll work harder to make sure the answer is as bad as worst case scenario.Sleep over here on the anxiety base and you may decrease that even if you end up ""annoying"" people (""you work too much - stop being such a cheater"") :-)   Therapy generally brings up underlying problems, correcting them helps because it makes the underlying problem less intense (clearing your mind for an instant) as well. I feel on this level you could practice and improve your confidence by yourself. If practicing what you told yourself is working in controlling and easing anxiety, then keep at it and maybe consider experimenting with different rules of ""What do I want?"" or ""What do I not want!"" I think the rule-setting can play out in different ways in each respect،Ã«asking a guy ""What's not a deal breaker here?""""; or ""Would you rather not have had asked about my availability than having even asked for it?"" are two very different ways to set boundaries.Additionally, you might ""set the place for"" meeting on the way to the fridge... if the walk together isn't enough to confirm it's possible to get to know a person at least ""a bit deeper"" than office lights, bathtubs, or bathing suits.Yet, if you do suddenly feel anxious at a moment when you were just giving yourself grace to see a guy for who he is (no pre-dated dramas borne of one's own scripts) then our stories we write together with our minds creates the anxiety state we wake up and instead need to sign up for a deal with the universe, the Life Coach of Hella Crisis Management, who assume you could break Badam's objectivity, and the way to your iPhone ""Delete this hampering trauma."" It can also well be that the ""crush"" guy has his own drama running thru his head that he's ignoring - a waste of time of course, because two people who don't allow themselves to exchange their internal dramas for something new I don't even know- have not made the journey of sharing/internalizing another person's story could be slowed by stories you've created and scripted of how you think of yourself. This could be breaking the hold of your own Fascination-Fixation"
"My parents seem okay with other sexualities, but normally they only talk about being gay. When they do talk about bisexuality, they say things like “they'll do anything” or things that make me very uncomfortable because I am bisexual. I don't know if I am ready to come out to them.","Perhaps you are not ready to come out to your parents.  Often times our readiness is not dependent on what others' will say or how they react. But more so dependent on how emotionally prepared we are to deal with others' reactions.  It may be beneficial for you to play out each possible scenario and conclusion (eg. your parents being supportive vs. your parents being disappointed and so on). How are you prepared to deal with the outcome?  You may also seek help through counselors, support groups and/or individuals you know that have dealt with similar situations to help you prepare to discuss this with your parents.  All the best!","The world in which you were born accepted other sexualities whether or not we talked much about it. However, it is harder for some people to imagine and accept people of opposite sexuality. Because even if people say they are open about these identities, any reservations or discomforts are almost always hidden. So your parents may indeed be fine with bisexuality even though it's the first identity that has come up with you. Then any new issue will be met by the same language of being 'fine' and not wanting to talk more about it. There is intense need for people to feel loved and validated from their families and but family members often fail to realize what is needed and appropriate. Maybe with open conversations you can explore what kind of response would be most helpful for you. Rather than criticizing any particular communication, simply encouraging one and showing appreciation for it could be very helpful. Also, validating what you are feeling and having you speak with more people like yourself can be supportive and incredible inspiration too. Good luck!"
"I've been going through a rough time lately. I been into nothing but women. I’ve never thought about men until a week ago. I’m very upset and depressed about this. It's not normal to me. I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that I’m not gay. I get the same results each time, and I feel disgust. This is tough on me. I'm scared that I looked too many times. I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.","Hello. Coming to terms with the idea that you might be of a sexuality other than the one in which you were socially raised to be, can be emotionally disturbing, and quite unsettling. It creates anxiety, maybe even panic, and leaves us feeling confused and uncertain about our own sense of identity. It becomes important to first ask yourself how you feel when you are thinking of being intimate with guys, or if you desire them to be intimate with you. It is important to know what impact this has on you, because it can determine your level of follow through and desire in pursuing sexual activity with someone of the same sex. I am not going to pass judgment on you either way - even for having the thoughts. I have worked with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) community in various ways over the years. Many I speak to, say they had to struggle to come to terms with this awareness about how they see themselves sexually. Maybe you are bisexual, and don't have an exclusive attraction to the same sex. You might consider doing some searches online for community support groups in your area, to explore the feelings and issues around this topic. Talking to someone who you trust can be helpful too. Running from your feelings is not a good idea, and others in a support group for sexuality issues, might be able to relate to you and what you're going through right now. This will offer you perspective, as you think on how this plays out in your life.Counselors are typically well trained to provide clinical services to clients who are experiencing feelings and thoughts much like the ones you are having now. I encourage you to consider reaching out for help. You are not crazy or insane for thinking of working with a counselor, nor of having feelings of same sex attraction. If you decide you are indeed gay, then know that you are not alone and never will be alone in that feeling. There is a huge community of support for you. Additionally, we all need help sometimes dealing with all sort of issues. A counselor can work more in depth with you to examine the motivations behind the feelings, and help you come to terms with them more directly. I hope that you come to a place where you feel less alone and more secure with yourself as you examine this area of your life. No matter what, do not fear being yourself. Again...you are not alone, I promise.Warm regards,Shawn Berthel, M.S., LMHC","Although I don't diagnose, I'm wondering if you are having obsessive or intrusive thoughts or images.  It sounds like this is causing you anxiety, because the thoughts of looking at gay porn were repeated and intrusive.  You might also describe these thoughts or images as hard to pause or eliminate on demand.  It sometimes helps to choose a particular type of intrusive content that you wish that existed...like an unusual form of bird or some cobweb placed in a particular room...makes things feel less alien or scary. I know you've tried restricting certain types of media, but focusing on a particular image ( especially any of those you've been exposed to while reading this answer) could help.  It also might help to approach these thoughts in a compassionate way - think about how you would react to a friend by saying ""Hey... I see a picture of birds that can fly hoops."" Or more firmly note them to be present - ""There is a picture...not what I would usually choose. But I'll notice and let it remain here.""  Making room for the image rather than resisting and trying to banish it is generally helpful."
"I have known her for years. She was dating my brother-in-law when we met. My kids think of her as their aunt. On Halloween 2014, I lost my mom to cancer.

"I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year and a half. He loves me a lot, and I love him. It hurts to be apart from him for so long. It hurts all over, and then I feel like it won't last.",I would suggest that you look up the word codependency and it's characteristics.  See if you relate to those characteristics.  I have a feeling  you have suffered some form of loss in your life that you have not dealt with properly.  For some reason you are depending on your boyfriend to fill that loss.  Considering working with a counseling to work through your emotions and resolve any lingering issues.,"Flashbacks of a prior relationship like falling in love or a breakup can worsten one's everyday anxiety.  This is particularly true if someone has not developed a relatively independent sense of Self.Every relationship is a new reminder of the pain already in your memories from earlier heart breaks.  There are many endeavours that can help you develop this kind of independence from others.  Balancing allows you to discover new pleasures in your own company while maintaining a close relationship.  Relaxation techniques also allow you to work out a good level of anxiety with acute episodes becoming shorter as you master it. 

Also, you will want to explore why your relationships with your previous partners did not last by learning the behaviours that did not work, as this will help you be able to use healthier ones on your current partner.  My hypothesis is that your infatuation -- love-- feels like a current strong pulling around you that you know is there but do not have the means to realistically anchor its feelings.  What Alan Lewis calls the unknown unknowns -- potential triggers that trigger anxiety fire in dangerous situations, but also in everyday life.  Parks and recreation include doing some volunteer work or joining a new group.Always be sure to keep the lines-of-communication open with your partner, but try not to over-checkied,  or resent each other.  People often are unhappy in their partnerships because they have not mastered the art of balancing self-sufficiency with a total commitment to each other.  Balance is a yin-yang.  In terms of your physical affection or sexual life, you'll need to release it (Ego Dissolution) in order and appreciate it once it re- enters.  Hope this gives you an idea of why this is happening."
Does counseling really do anything that can help people?,Counseling can go a long way in improving your mental health. Counseling helps you to get new perspective on your life and problems.Talking about your problems with a counselor gives them substances and something to get a handle on. Talking about your problems gives you a chance look at your situation from a new angle to help solve your problems.The counselor is a neutral listener that can help give direction and answers to your needs.Counseling can help you solve your problems but also can set up a plan for the future. Counseling can help you to deal with things before they get out of hand.Give counseling a try.,"Many people ask are therapists effective. The result is that no consultant can become a perfect or miraculous responder because we all have our personal limits of interpretation, prediction and treatment.During counseling, we clinicians help people with emotional problems by developing therapeutic formulations based on psychological knowledge, talking with people with the aim to help them reach their personal goals. We do this through learning how a person thinks and feels about self and the world, and looks into their past for insight to self and current problems and helps them to develop better coping skills. We can not expect someone to start feeling better and working on tasks after first session, but in with practice we start to be able to use our saber skills to help. Clinical supervision enhances and improves our facilitation skills and focuses concepts and imagination related aspects of counseling and which result in better therapist interventions and expertise.Improvements and problems resolved depends on person's personal expectations and beliefs about how we work on clients and personal drive to get better. Counselling might become somewhat of a placebo effect as we help to change problems really and make sense of things from a new perspective. It then becomes a new belief system it's own right. But, counseling offers our clients to move past feeling and become part of the effort to elaborate personal skills and behaviors.Since counselling works through rapport, pros and cons based logic it can be highly educational for people in good hands to be informed of natural learning personhood ability of humans to integrate new and unique ideas.

"I just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. My family and I really need this job.
   People keep telling me I have ""anxiety"" and I'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. This is all new to me. What can I do?","Hi, It is really good that you are working so hard to take care of your family. Anxiety can be so challenging, especially when new challenges have come up. It would be good to work through some of these issues you are experiencing, and examine your self care and support processes.","It would be inadvisable for me to diagnose you with an anxiety disorder from a brief online forum.  However, so many people experience anxiety that, in the same way that anyone may experience high straight or stop jogging when at risk or injury, you too may feel a nervous-sounding fear of a health-related catastrophe.  Our brains want to keep us safe, so anxiety is actually a very natural and healthy andenergizing state.  All of that being said, fear (anxiety) is also a response to a situational trigger and, when the trigger is too great for me to handle became fairly common (including on routine travel), you may need a few techniques to bring energy down a bit and remind yourself that you are competent and shared responsibility for your safety is being taken by everyone.  Tip #1:Tackle the difficult area directly by speaking directly with a friend or family who will provide a sense of reassurance and be ready to share practical help, resources, and a sense of routinized shared responsibility.  Tip #2: Mindfulness and acceptance (like Buddhism and modern therapy bend toward) can help you to stay in the here vs. mindlessness gay asylum type thoughts.  Mindfulness:  Learn to become aware and describe your situation in objective terms  accept the present situation as terrible, but manageable each time you go in your head and think sensory and emotional (See road, hear surrounds, feel cramping is you panic agitation) . Instead, look at the facts and describe the situation, logically : I saw eight cars on the highway. There's a bridge down the road ahead. I'm driving 200 mph in city traffic  Acceptance (in front of the bridge) helps you recognize that your concern and a feeling that something terrible fallout, is reasonable, but also needing some wise professional help to make effective life changes.  Tip #3: Ground your energyBy doing simple hand tricks and flicking forearm nails and brain facts (Did you know fingers can feel texture while a second finger turns perspective blind?) to bring back feeling of control. Every time you notice the neglected recognition and feeling of detachment, try these simple palm touches:  ""grounding"" (believe in your plan for getting the job), (thank the universe for taking charge of your spiritual balance – your subconscious and your body's signs), hold the pinch safety and ""okay I can too"" tricks and hear your favorite excellent motivational speech.Present moment ""love pacifying lap and breathe into it"" (think You're not alone because a loved one is giving you a metaphorical lap to breathe into note intensifies energy that you are loved,the meditation and family courageous reciprocity would be in your head).  And to be both re-expressive and receptive, move around. Relishing the sense of sound, vibration, temperature and sensations like moving, standing, walking.  Tip #7)If you have symptoms of: shaking, blowing up reflex, rapid heart beat, sense of leakage(Qeep away fear in your loon leadingspace), sweating.Note:Those are some of the different words used for ""anxiety"".  Remember to boot your social support into verified self-reassurance!Sometimes Anxiety is excitement in hindsight waysalamu'"
"I'm in my late teens and live with my dad.  The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I won't want to talk to them for days or even weeks. 

Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.

Are they right, am I depressed?","Hello. Being a teenager in our society today can cause depression quite easily. We look at the world in which we live, and the doubts we have about being able to make a contribution, or to have value and worth with the people around us, and we begin to internalize those messages of self-worth. If that alone were not enough, you are trying to figure out where you want to go in life, and who you are supposed to be in the world. Teens are faced with pressures of being judged by your peers for how you present yourself; following current fashions; possessing the trendy things; and hanging out with the ""in crowd."" Here's a ""secret"" that might help with most of those issues: Not much of those problems I've just described will really matter as they might seem to right now, in the real world. If you are feeling depression because you feel you lack some of those things that are seen as important by others (like your peers), I can assure you that being someone who is kind; compassionate; understanding of another person's suffering; and the effort you make to be the best person you can become in the world, will far outweigh anything you experienced in your teen years.When we are young, we judge everything based on what our peers have, what they say, the way they dress, who's popular, who's not popular, and for the most of it, all of that is external. So the question becomes, are you trying to fix the feelings on the inside (the internal stuff), with the trappings of all the stuff on the outside (the internal)? That is to say, do you feel that if you had what your friends have, you would be happy and less depressed? Depression is usually a symptom of something much bigger, it is not typically a problem by itself (just as a person who experiences a high temperature may likely have a cold). So fixing the symptom requires looking at the possible causes. In your post, you mentioned that you live with your dad. Are your parents divorced or separated, or has your mom passed away? Either of these circumstances could certainly cause depression. Finding out when you started feeling depressed, might be able to pinpoint the trigger that caused it, which requires looking at when you last felt really happy. It is also important to keep in mind, that as a teenager, your emotions are often being experienced very randomly, and sometimes without cause. It is part of your emotional development, but as you grow older can learn how to manage those emotions better and practice doing things that help you feel better (without causing harm to yourself).Have you tried talking to your dad about your feelings, or maybe another relative if you feel safer doing so? Do you have a friend who is your best friend...someone who is there for you no matter what? If not, there is a service you can use that is a national number for teens to talk with teen peer counselors. They are teens like yourself, but they have some insights that might be helpful. Its called Teen Line (https://teenlineonline.org/). It helped me when I was in my teens, and has helped lots of other teens as well. You might find a place to get some referrals to other local services in your area. If you want are in Washington state and would like to connect with me directly, you call link to me via my profile page. Or perhaps finding a counselor in your local area might be useful. Most towns and cities have some form of low cost counseling. You might also check with your school for assistance.Don't be afraid of not always knowing how you are supposed to feel. Adults don't always have a handle on it either. Being a teenager carries a lot stress, fear, and uncertainty. But you are not alone, and there is help if you reach out for it. I wish for you the very best, and bright future. ","That's a good question! It's hard to say without having more of a sense of how you were feeling before. What's really important in determining that it's worth talking to a therapist is whether it's affecting any area of your life that is kind of problematic for you or that you're not happy with.Here's something else that I was wondering. You say you're never going to do anything right. That's a big statement, so I was thinking: look at your standards objectively! I was thinking for a moment maybe they're a little bit outlandish. A bit high right? Sometimes, especially if there's a reaction with anxiety, that can be the way we create stress for ourselves.I guess I'm not saying there's something wrong with you so you're sure of, butit's worth having a look. Why do you make those thoughts about yourself? I hope you're getting encouragement from your friends, especially. Or else, has your dad been encouraging you doing the right things? Something else that you're willing to share with me?"
I’m facing severe depression and anxiety and I just feel like I’m going through a lot. This really distracts me and I cant get my mind off the things that are bothering me.    How do I overcome this anxierty and depression?,Anxiety and depression are often linked. I don't consider them as diseases. Depression is a symptom of deep hurts to the sense of self that leaves a person feeling shamed. Anxiety is a symptom of not being given the proper emotional resources to handle the problems of life. It is also the result of being taught that life is a dangerous place that can't be managed.,": Psychotherapy is a promising treatment option to manage anxiety and depressive disorders. Treatment involves the use of emotions, sometimes challenging thoughts, and working through experiences in order to better understand one's thoughts, feelings, and motivations. The client may be asked to recall vital memories and identify transformation procedures and insight-making techniques. Various forms of psychotherapy exist, including interpersonal psychotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy, and supportive psychotherapy."
"My husband and I have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. Others have told me that most men would have left me by now. Honestly, I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing. I want to be better connected with my husband.","It's encouraging that you say you want ""to be better connected with [your] husband,"" and since he hasn't left you, he must care about you and the relationship more than he does about just having sex. You don't say whether he complains or not, but even if he doesn't it seems there's a sense of something important missing for both of you.Most likely to connect better with him physically you'll need to become better connected with yourself and your body. Men often feel fulfilled by sex simply because it happened - the woman they want received them, allowed them to make love with her. For women that can sometimes be more complicated. A woman who loves sex most likely also loves her body, knows what pleasures her, and feels confident asking for what she wants. Self-pleasuring can be a way for you to discover more about your sexuality, and a classic resource is Betty Dodson's book Sex for One: The Joy of Selfloving. A good counselor or sex therapist can be very helpful with your whole relationship as well as the sexual part of it, but not all counselors are comfortable working with sexual issues. Shop around and be sure you find someone who can help you and your husband get better connected on all levels.","This question brings numerous feelings to mind: vulnerability, self-promotion in order to be necessary or wanted, seeking connection.  More questions: Why haven't we had sex more often? What can I do in this situation to grow from it? I am asking you to take a moment and look inward. Seeing a counselor may help you to continue on this path.  Keep in mind that your relationship may be difficult to change, but you can control how much you make it matter, how much control you have.  The reaction you can get and how much control you can put on you own life regarding your partner depend on (1) what you think that they will do and (2) what they ever do.If you imgine someone still loves you no matter what, that is what you will find.  If on the other hand you think, ""Well, it's never been good, and shouldn't be any better if we just try"" then you may not find what you are looking for...Delicious sex doesn't get eaten and liquor is a very good ambassador for being right about things.The question is one for an at spa counselor, but a good one nonetheless. You are putting a lot of stress on the relationship already by making it feel even its yours with the statement ""Others have told me that most men would have left me by now"" (episodes of conflict and infighting will lead your partner to ""early exit tickets"".Once this decision has been taken it will be hard to get back...you will start way ahead of your expectations...)Loneliness is scary!

"I'm a teenager and I get these really intense mood swings.    My mood will be really high and I'll think of something that I want to do. When I start to make it happen I get irritated by other people if they intervene. Then if the thing I wanted to do doesn't work out, I have these tendencies to blame other people for it not working out.    Can you explain what's going on?","Mood swings and getting frustrated when things don't work out is totally normal. Sometimes, we get tied to one thing we really want to do and it can feel pretty intense when that gets interrupted or doesn't work out. This said, you're coming to CounselChat and so I'm guessing this is something that is pretty intense for you and something that you are concerned about. If this is getting in the way of your life, it may be worthwhile to reach out to a therapist or doctor to get some help with this and see if there might be something more going on. While for most people frustration/mood swings is related to typical life and stress, if very intense it can be a sign of a number of challenges ranging from anxiety to a traumatic experience to something like Bipolar Disorder where a person's mood and energy might fly so high (mania) that one feels like they can do anything but often become frustrated when interrupted (note: there is a lot more to Bipolar Disorder than this and this is certainly not a diagnosis). Wish you well!","You're right about a famous quote: ""When pushing your triggers, it is not more and more anger, which comes,"" but ""The shuddering of the limbs, the electric pinch of all the muscles trying to get together to express the angry that is secreted deep down. To be pulled out into the air from destruction... for the sake of highlighting and accepting the whole knock-down to almost to the dead... That's my being."" The main point is that we notice ourselves (on the good days) because we're capable even when we are angry to step back and reflects on what our feelings want to express. The bad days are the opposite way. Felt feelings force us to act before we can observe them. So just try putting a bit less energy into the things you feel have sucked the fear of your dependents removing you or not being enough for them out of you. They are there to feed and to bring you in and hold when fuelling your missions of victory over what exists out of our safe place to be withdraw from, or to make less hazardous for them so that they may and can fearlessly feel and be together with

Recognizing you are in a quest is already a big first step. Taking the time to start figuring out who you are is definitely the next... do so with SELF COMPASSION and kindness. Know this is a process and just look forward for what you might find.  I do recommend you find someone to talk to (there are many options out there that can fit the situation you are in), and I also recommend you start by giving yourself the importance to invest some time and effort in this quest. YOU DESERVE IT. There are some excellent TED Talks you can google, great books you can read, or even joining a yoga practice, team or some kind of hobby may help. Anything that shows yourself you are worthy of this effort. Have patience and start!!!! the answer is out there waiting for you. Asking these questions already set you on the right path.","Unable to change how we feel about ourselves and about relationships with others is a way of remaining stuck or frozen in psychological terms. Actions set an obedient framework, while feelings have been deaf. Emotions can be defined as feeling states that are indicative of the presence or deficiency of certain values in the experienced world. A class of feeling states, similar to passions in pre-Enlightenment times, produce the movement or impulses that fuel our behavior (peace, joy, courage). The feeling state of being ""worthless"" is its own set of imperatives that make us act the way we're describing. That is, to indefinitely stay put and feel tolerable, that is to support a fairly stable tank but at continued low level. Our thought life would predict it as unreality.18 years later developed the idea specific name for this set of feelings called Having Berths All Heart Attacks (HABHA).A person grapples with desires in a charismatic way as much their fate as theirs. If wishes are carried too far, the belief they can succeed in hastening pain or gaining freedom can render them more stuffy, more severe. This view of wishes attempts to create a nuanced descriptive theory of the effect of wishful thinking. When seeing that mirroring behaviour (more stuffylike when we worry about our future ecstasies), we give up the idea of freedom from anxiety, hence the continued mistake to dreamOur wishful ideal of standard of living feels more and more substantial, more urgent, meaningful, necessary.What makes this so dangerous is that once psychiatry has tampered with this which is an adaptive sense of self-efficacy and honest appraisal, the belief it is true can be static, no matter the evidence, just yearning for worth. The wishful self-efficacy trap states that wishful thinking is entirely negatively valenced, drives problematic behaviour (procrastination) yet never is triggered when we try to act, or preemptively bad. And of course we're poor absent such benefits of wanting worth.The solution is gradual. Pick a bit of caring in the middle of feeling ""worthless"" and examine how you hold onto this feeling. Observe what prompts feelings (are they continuing ritualistic creations of belief? do remain futile?), cannot Ace experiments one always does (but we can talk about our failed attempts). The sad truth of mistaken fidelity that ways made us stuck tells us we need to get rid of our unintentional detractors, those rituals performed automatically to avoid violence from our self-delusion. For proposing this, there is obvious ridicule, but much continued inactivity. Defence mechanisms protecting us from feeling alone in our unique condition, inhabiting lives that astronomically centred our lives between our mental self (sadistically separating feeling fraudulent self from self). My favourite point is that things cannot become ""more worthes"", they can just feel more worthwhile, elevated. That deserves the thermochemical therapy to achieve.&nbsp;A no-password, free having a critics here ( thanks Aakash)"

Is there a reason no one sparks my interest?","Yes, of course there's a reason!There's always a reason for most dynamics!Depending on the nature and qualities of what changed as a result of your new self realizations, you may be more deeply affected by your new awareness than how you imagined these would go.Since you already are on the best road possible for yourself, since this resulted from your own introspection, keep trusting your own self work as to what develops and at what pace your relationship attraction qualities grow.","Research background and your comments suggest to me that you are going in a good direction!There are a limiting number of relationships that you can be in and the correlations between you having been unhappy in a relationship because of the person when the relationship ends and you being single/alone feels like a strange re-living of this history but currently the social predictors of dating/divorce relationship status are very weak in multivariate models and don't seem to be meaningful at the individual level!Perhaps there are some other social or emotional predictors of dating/divorce that have not been found yet but since you cannot be a proportion of the ""population"" (you are the only one of your kind,) no estimated models or predictors can be meaningfully applied to you.Previously you were satisfied (chirped) and sound happy with “advised marriage” (by parents/neighbors/clerical and Catholic tradition!!) but the timing got off  and the meetings stopped working in a way that satisfied you; warning of marriage rituals and the protocol with ""reminders"" to complete certain milestones; telling people ""single/depressed/affected by break-up, but hope to find someone and then marry and keep the house together"" well, you will realize the zeal to get someone enough so are there gone/who can’t do the charting 'oh my god I made her mad 3 days before our 6 month anniversary!!^""; the ritual (having a ceremony/best man/mistress of honor/friends invited) didn't make the person and/or the marriage end well so the best men/friends think this ritual is nonsense and avoid it; worried about how you didn't get anyone since you had marriage rituals repeated; maybe also concerned about closely monitoring your dating so if someone lifts the veil you will advise a ceremony and this is something to be avoided. It doesn't sound like a race course or competition but it could easily be perceived as one (you saying ""just remember 2 dates not day of date 3 month anniversary 10 year anniversary"" in a tone of instruction); also some common stereotypes come from governor's wife (Ii married apr 2008 20.5 months without any ceremony ;;) that actually end up supporting a wedding; Meeting a man born during puberty (100% of men you high school dating periods.) also could make her seem unplanned and the ""challenge of lack of tradition"" may be raised margarita piña colada and scoring the index reminding her it's almost her wedding day (watch send off tsunami in area r.perception of wedding invitations even after sent akinakin to prom invitation; Tome lessons from your past relationship in terms of humorisms (enjoy the presence of the other), loyalty and humor; These are general findings from pet observations and are strongest on already-long (20 year+) relationships.Inward regard in the long run (not depending upon the relationship), assess each relationship again to see if you/knew certain regularities (and incorporated appropriate new skills.) Inward regard sometimes requires a little change in focus from external factors to internal, especially if feedback is hard to separate from the opinions of others. This theme of realigning the focus from external approval to coding your own success rather than other people's success is closely related to risk avoidance, which triggered a whole set of associated habits.  When risk avoidance gets more pronounced and inhibits your growth (change and experiment), the inner alarm clock takes an alarming tone and is persistent.Noticing this theme (local problem) and working on it (fixing the alarm system) to reduce its frequency and intensity is a good general approach, but the theme must be addressed on an ongoing basis.  Best of luck to you as much as you are human! :)"
"When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. She is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but I am afraid she is stressing too much.

I find after a broken sleep her emotions being intense, even if the problem, was some irrelevant/mild thing (like the scary movie you are watching together). 2) Have you checked with your pediatrician on the child's strokes to learn a better sense of when your daughter is crying for something that can't be explained? 3)What is your best guess about what she means?If you are conscious of the things you say to your daughter about her emotions, begin speaking a different way to her about feeling/scarred/blows and that it is OK to feel like that.

"I'm fine when we start becoming intimate, but out of nowhere, I will get a flashback of what happened to me in the past. I start hysterically crying and freaking out when my boyfriend obviously has done nothing to hurt me.","Have you sought the support of a therapist really qualified in working through sexual trauma? It can take some work, but healing is possible. If you feel able to, it may also help to open a dialogue with your boyfriend about what you need from him when you have these flashbacks. Let him know what some helpful responses may be. ","I don't know how much of an effect your revisitation of your previous experiences may have on your increase in desire for intimacy with your boyfriend. I'm not assuming your past experiences were bad, but the way you say it, revisiting them seems to have a negative emotional hook for you. When you enter into a situation that makes you feel good with your boyfriend, even if you are not consciously aware of it, the associated emotions may simmer underneath the surface. But with all the expectations that sometimes arise when you have a relationship, when they get pushed out or you experience a trigger, you suddenly have all the pressure of your whole life fit into a single exploding cask. The feeling of having lost self control can absolutely set in. The good thing about a strong relationship is that if you communicate with your boyfriend and let him know what you feel and if he has concerns about you, he will respect and work with you to get to a safe place. Trust is a key element here. When you feel safe, self help skills and behaviors reveal themselves."
"I've hit my head on walls and floors ever since I was young. I sometimes still do it but I don't exactly know why,    I have anxiety and I had a rough childhood but now I'll start to hit my head and sometimes not realize it but I don't know how to stop or even why I'm doing it.    How can I help myself to change my behavior?","The best way to handle anxiety of this level is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor, and therapy to help you understand the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are causing the anxiety. This is not something that anyone should just “white knuckle” and try to get through on their own with no help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety. This takes a therapist trained in CBT. You will learn to recognize when and why you perform the behavior of hitting your head, help you deal with the underlying cause of this, and replace the behavior with a more positive behavior. You'll learn coping skills.You mention having a rough childhood. Anyone who has experienced trauma like this, especially long-term ongoing trauma from abuse of any kind, definitely does not need ""exposure therapy"", which is what is recommended for phobias. You need a therapist trained specifically in trauma informed therapy.You are on the right path by recognizing there is an issue and what it is. Good luck with your healing journey!","Remember that healing is a process. You may have some role models who show you self-confidence and centration, and mild or no self-harming behavior, but you may have had others who portrayed self-harm and self-isolation behavior. Your environment may hold an influence.Moreover, you're telling us that you have anxiety and a rough childhood. Both of these elements can influence the way you maintain your focus on your thoughts, activities and self. The binary operation of thinking may have interfered in the appreciation of how you are evaluating your interpersonal perception. Your anxiousness with tightly constricted self-confidence and the inability to introspect on sedentary isolation can interfere in your consolidation of the meaning of self. ‌You may seek action that reflects this lack of clear understanding of one’s self.The fact that you are suffering from an unrelenting physical pain when you are in a stressful situation reminds us that the presence of anger, foolishness, fear, etc. can trigger pain through the constructive disposal of stagnant energy. That is commonly called “energetic block.” There are several routines and techniques that help us to orient properly and put aside the emotional overload that we have internalized. Our obsessions become compulsions, and we touch or hit or stab ourselves to break the violence arrest caused by the contents of our minds. We can explore virtual restorative exercises such as digitalanallycalculus.org which helps to interface immediate timelessness roots—like non sexual technique—for clarifying core themes such as self-worth and center. You may seek pragmatism on obsessive thoughts, and acceptance for undesirable sensations that result from involuntary compulsions.Everyone is unique; there’s no recipe that will get you everywhere, but there are easy, online done-with-me exercises to stop scolding yourself and to combat the ritual of blood.

"My husband and I had our first threesome recently. Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me.    He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better, and now I'm craving more of it. But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling. Why am I feeling this way?","You need to have an honest conversation with each other about WHY you both want a threesome. Evaluate the status of your relationship with each other. Are you having issues? Fighting? Not feeling satisfied with each other? How has your sex life been with each other?  If there are any problems, insecurities, issues, introducing something like this may only make your relationship worse. Open relationships and threesomes rarely work out well. Sure, there are some who successfully live this lifestyle, but it only works when both people are completely secure in their relationship with each other, harbor no jealousies or insecurities, and aren't looking to someone else to satisfy needs that aren't getting met by their spouse. Let me say that again: This is not likely to work out well for you if either of you are insecure, jealous, or looking to have needs met by this other person that you aren't getting from your spouse. That empty feeling you're having - listen to it. Dig deep to find out where it is coming from. What thoughts are going through your head when you feel that way? You'll get the answer.The other thing that helps make something like this work is for both of you to listen and respect each other. If you don't like it that he paid more attention to the other girl, he needs to know that, and he needs to respect that.  If you're going to do it again, he needs to know what you're comfortable with and what you want. Set the limits before you're in the moment, before it's too late to take an action back. Turn it around and ask him what he would be comfortable with if it were a man instead of a woman.It is perfectly natural to be curious and want to experiment. A lot of people get that out of the way before settling down in a monogamous relationship. People who marry young and/or inexperienced may still feel that curiosity about things like that and want to experience them, but don't want to hurt their spouse. The REASON you are both doing this matters a lot. If there are problems in your relationship, this is likely to only make things worse.","It is understandable that you would have a variety of mixed feelings after taking part in this activity. Afterall, you are not typically involving another partner with whom you may have a one-time interest in interacting with sexually (different from the very close relationship you have with your husband). It also seems that you were comfortable communicating about it with your husband once it had taken place, therefore it is not difficult for you to activate a sense of empathy by imagining what the other woman may have been feeling during your threesome. However, I am wondering whether you began to feel an emptiness towards someone who you and your husband were experimenting with together? Either way it is not unusual to feel an emotional response towards a person who was involved in an activity with you and another partner. In the end, you and your husband decide what matters to you for the rest of your continuing relationship, and whether or not more frequent threesomes will fit in with that. Knowing that this is how you are feeling may be a good indicator that you are wanting to restart these trysts. With good communication, any relationship partner can come up with ways a person can feel satisfied/destined to find a type of pleasure that turns them on, without using her partner following the same path as her husband who practiced it with her. If you want this confidence, you can thank the other woman who hypnotised you. She (if I'm not wrong) must have's said that you would enjoy doing it all over again.Sincerly,Corinne H.

"I'm in my mid 20s with a husband and children. I love my family, but I feel like I've lost my identity, and I don't know who I am other than a mom and wife. At times, all I can think is what I gave up and how I feel unhappy and trapped, but I know I'd feel like worse without them. I loathe myself at times. I have an amazing life, so why can't I just enjoy it?","It is not easy being a wife and mother. You have shifted roles in your life. You went from having a career to focusing on your family. Transitioning can be hard, especially when we feel we gave something up that we really wanted. I want to acknowledge you for wanting to be the best wife and mother you can. I think it is great that you are self-aware and want to work on this.Feeling ""unhappy and trapped"" may also mean that you are  believing these negative thoughts are absolutely true. We have lots and lots of thoughts throughout the day. Sometimes we pay a lot of attention to some and some we ignore. Right now these thoughts are getting a lot of your attention and perhaps you are thinking because you are thinking them they are true.  Is it really true that you trapped? You also said that you have an amazing life. It doesn't sound like you are only having negative thoughts. You have some positive ones, too. However, you are giving a lot of weight to the negative thoughts, more weight than the positive ones.I also wonder if you are struggling with the fact that you are even having this thought. One thing that can be helpful is to recognize that you are having a thought, that it is a negative thought, that thinking it does not make it true, and to let it go. This is the basis for mindfulness work that can be really helpful. It is a great place for you to start so you can balance out your thoughts and emotions.Best of luck to you!","When we choose to pore over what we did or could have done differently, we develop patterns of self-criticism and density in the mind.We live in an age where many people are so captivated by mistakes and failures, this can make us see ourselves as a collection of patches. However reflecting on only one area of us, opens us up to notice negative patterns that launched into a self-defeating spiral. The more we resent our feelings and our lives, the more we ignore our needs and how we want to be. If we allow ourselves to change our reaction, we disrupt this spiral.This can be done by gently recognizing that we are experiencing negative emotions and remembering that emotions are just here now, and will pass. When this attitude breach occurs we should also offer wholesome messages to ourselves and observe that often we are both our ally and our toughest critic. Even acknowledging the fact that we HBO technology or interactive content adds unwanted content to our homes and family life is in itself a pretty great first step. Creating a habit of acknowledging feelings and challenging our harsh messages can help us to gain perspective, develop habits and behaviors in our homes that favor the presence of our children and close ones, and reach authority limits on our professions. As we gradually practice these new ways of being, we do slowly see our worlds change. Even if it is a change of the trying manner as we hold new habits in place until they become normal."
I am going through a very hard time and I'm so depressed. My parents are getting a divorce and a lot of bad things are happening. I want to lull myself.,"It sounds like a tough time and it's normal to feel down when your family is going through a divorce or other hardship. There's a difference between feelings like sadness, discouragement, grief, loneliness and depression, though. Sadness is sadness and sometimes we have to go through a grieving or other process, that is a normal reaction to events in our lives. Depression, on the other hand, is more about being stuck. Lulling yourself with self-care sounds like a healthy response and a way to give yourself support. So as to the uncomfortable but healthy part of your feelings, do the best you can to put names to it and share with a trusted other person. You will find comfort. The part of your situation that's depression -- feeling stuck, not able to get out of bad, concentrate, changes in sleeping and eating, loss of enjoyment in living, poor hygiene, feelings of hopelessness, that's different. First step, identify your own symptoms of depression. If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself, tell someone. If you're not sure, you can try 800-lifenet or other support line to get feedback. First aid for depression includes: daily care and feeding, good sleeping and eating, lots of exercise--even when you don't feel like it-- healthy socializing, and focusing on talking to yourself in a positive way. If you aren't able to move yourself out of your depression,  work with a professional to make short-term goals and get some support. You may also talk to your doctor or psychiatrist about trying an anti-depressant to give you a little lift while you go through a rough patch.Best wishes,Karen",": I hear that you're in a difficult time and you're feeling depressed.

I've been with the mother of my child for years.,I would think that you hold little self worth and feel that you are not worthy of better.  I would suggest that you get to know yourself.   What do you NEED in a relationship?  What is holding you to this relationship other than your child?  What have gone on in the relationship that makes you think or feel you deserve such disrespect?  Just a few questions to ask yourself..,"Are you currently together with the mother of your child? If so, how would you describe your relationship with her? Then think about why you like to be with her. Consider what it is about having a loving relationship with the mother of your child (and not being alone for the few years after your son was born,) that is helping you feel like yourself?Is there anything about a more committed relationship with her that would detract from your sense of who you are?  Are there perhaps certain things she would (or would not) permit you to do? If so, is the idea of limiting your ability to form relationships in the future if you are in a committed relationship something you are uncomfortable with?And finally, stop talking to yourself, and promise yourself that you can convince yourself of the added benefit of a long term relationship! There are, of course other things that would either make a long term relationship more appealing with this person or hurt your temptation to stay single.

"I've got so much anger. I don't know how to control myself. My girlfriend screams at me all the time, and sometime I don't know how to deal with life. I'm very depressed and angry. I feel lost.","Hi Campbell River, You say you have anger but you don't mention how it shows. Or maybe it doesn't. Are you aggressive with your girlfriend? Since you mention depression, I wonder if you're bottling it all up somewhere instead of letting it show at all. If this is the case, I admire your ability to not lash out at someone who's hurting you. However, if they are totally  unexpressed, anger turn inward and shift into depression. When she yells at you, what do you do? Is this the moment that you feel the most angry? I wouldn't be surprised; anger is a normal response to someone yelling at you. Something about anger...it's often there to cover up our more vulnerable emotions. Under the anger I wonder if you feel worthless, powerless, scared, unloved. Part of the trick to reducing anger is identifying those other emotions and expressing them. You say you don't know how to deal with life, and I think maybe you mean you don't know how to deal with emotions. Lots of people don't! This is confusing for most of us. What am I feeling? Why is it so strong? I'm afraid to express it for fear of hurting someone (or falling apart, or feeling alone...). How do I know what to express and what to be quiet about? These are all great questions to ask yourself, and a qualified therapist can help you sort it all out and support you in your growth. I wish you well!","What are you trying to accomplish by shouting? How about try to talk in a calm tone of voice and discuss the real underlying problem issues? Honestly, I know this is easier to say than it is to do. I myself do see myself shouting, especially when I truly am in distress. So it takes a lot of awareness and long practice to change entrenched bad habits. Language changes how we feel. There are great books about Changing what we say. (Positive Intelligence) By Shahar Lester and GASOL by Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Holiday. The way we communicate can have a powerful effect on our emotions. If you feel like you're running out of useful words, maybe it helps to change it and actually pick out few words on purpose. Jot them down, and whenever you scream, try to remember the words you picked. Instead of being angry, are there more descriptive words for your emotion and the situation it's in.) Relationship counseling can truly help, if you are committed to the process. What's the history of your relationship? What does each of you want? What conflict is happening? You've been together in this for 1/4 of your life. Time is a good thing; self-reflection is a very valuable skill. Your partner and you being actively engaged in knowing yourselves and each other is something no one can take away from you; it's always possible to change and evolve. I wish you both love and light. Hope you find the ideal therapy practice for you and your girlfriend. PaulaOrange Think Different, Learn Different, Grow DifferentBy Paula Orange, www.PaulaOrange.com"
Does counseling really do anything that can help people?,"Hi!  Great question.  I believe counseling does help people! Of course, I am a therapist, so I would think that! :)  Seriously - I think therapy and counseling allow us to understand ourselves, our motivations and the things that bring us happiness and discontent.  Therapy can create opportunities to try new skills and enhance positive attributes that are already present in someone.  I like to think of therapy as an unbiased ""aerial view"" of our lives. Someone outside can often help us notice things we might otherwise miss. Hope this helps!","Therefore, I would want my clients asked this question before they commit:They are thinking about this question:   Which part of me under considerationâ€¦has awareness of the part that I am addressing in my choice to seek counseling?

I feel like even if I did forgive her, I wouldn't be able to say it to her face.","How someone feels when they forgive another, is at peace with themselves and their understanding of what went wrong, who was responsible for what in the situation, and clarity on their own motivation, actions, emotions including pain, regret, resentment, sadness.These steps ideally allow a new door to open in order to develop new paths in the existing relationship or accept that this will not be possible due to either person's way of handling themselves.The long answer would be that you're not yet through with this process.I commend you on being truthful with yourself about yourself.You're on the right track by expecting to feel resolved when you've reached resolution, and not before.Finding patience with the unpredictable amount of time needed to thoroughly examine all the details of the incidents you mention, sometimes is a frustration of its own.Keep up your good work of knowing your own life.It is a worthwhile endeavor!","Sure, please send me a DM. Generally I recommend that you think about the things that you want to say to her and write them down.  That will also get the work of sorting the feelings out.  If she is to point, saying, ""That's what I do! Sorry, but I can't change!"" and she is unwilling to change, even where you may forgive her, one approach would be to not cross your tennis line.  This becomes tricky because it is your mother and you fear how she will react, especially since it already is a difficult relationship for you.  I recommend seeking help from an Area FVCA or better yet an AA or AA 2or 3ox where you can have your feelings aired.  Dialogue with others and people who are possible in the environment already, will bring confidence that your voice matters."

How does a person start the counseling process?,"I'd recommend looking on psychologtoday.com, reading the bio's of potential therapists who you think you would relate best with, then contact them through e-mail or on the phone.","tremendous question! I wish there was a single answer but probably not. Many therapists contact potential clients directly, but typically, the first step is to call the office and make an appointment. I commonly ask prospective clients to fill out a questionnaire, and also would encourage the individual to do so on their own. If the questionnaire is too large, I would let the person know I will phone them to go over the questionnaire so that they don't become overwhelmed. Then I usually do a brief phone intake that I discuss my approach to therapy, my finish of leaving for a decade (you never get over a decade (coincidentally, that fair amount of time passes between large feelings that are a little hard to grasp: from allergies to feeling like you ""wish I wasn't born"" :), I discuss setting process goals. If the counselor has other holidays patterned with their temperaments or styles like someone with diabetes in wanting strictly to stick to a careful management level of risk (meating the therapy times to a strict avoidant type of reproductive set off trip) that person surely tells you before you complete process anyway...I wish relationships could just operate with avoidance in consulting type staff those who ideally give info to others without forgetting. The important part of confronting loss is making sure the reminder isn't a burden or avoidance trigger. Working through the grief means you eventually want to honour by roughly remembering that very privately and feeling proud you got through the pain. We all need a reminder to progress, especially us who do most of our learning through messing up and then remembering via mode aversion we identified that there is a less painful way to go. Also I does want to talk at length about any major diagnosis such as depression but in general, clients have the tip of the iceberg issue rather than wanting to expose the iceberg itself. I would say I seldom do that myself... )))))),  Sometimes I simply do not touch on depression but I do discuss the diagnosis and requirement for medication usage gradually. Then I will talk about and get comfortable with the person to probably start do your exercises or speak about depression and how we keep evolving. I would maybe emphasise those aspects or any key pieces most central to you. I also would examine any level of commitment you are ready to go, then I could encourage new aspects or habits grown and implemented. Most people like to talk it out to begin, pain the individual and avoid decision, and after talkings in trying to avoid push them into action. The end goal is avoidable, but is it worth it? Right? Avoidably Not.
One approach is gradually accepting uncomfortable feelings as good so that the threat reducesand transitions to become part of normal life. So that makes us alert but unbothered. Works in acute chat you get the feel of where you are coming from. And when you're ready I colour those edges in, but the depth of the area is a job you want to do alone. I’m not certain, but I find that process of accepting itself without focusing on it often means it dissolves without dramatic climax. And almost immediately when you""clear"" the emotional coloring out of the area, things restored to the ""ground state""(clean) in my mind. Works best in resetting the emotional reference bone of the brain. We do lazy things sometimes and get stuck in fear apart from our own expectations and assumptions, which is probably 95% of the sorrow, yes, and 5% actual outside circumstance. My method (actually, a lot of therapists and counsellors) is a behavioural start which is very good at screw cursing your body into the notaton, problem prism, which often is stuck in one place.Practice mindfulness forms a different base state(i.e it does not mix in with other emotions ...though we do dispose of 'triggering details' for huge shocks such as abuse or burning your hand (big time) as being too much to handle. Regardless, if you tell others you are numb, cold, or ""model C"", you are signalling a broken, lost person who needs help which is emotionally boring people if I was basically starting in some blanket grade of sadness. Otherwise I like to do coffee talk and then set a question so if they ""respond habitually with ""I don't know"" or ""HMM"" then we anchor pain with that particular stimulus, beginning tear, indent someone sitting on their lap, any medium rubbed though the item, etc by highlighting question specificity. (pulling online source from the encounter, putting in response window of 10-20 mins canvassing the sharp edge_now it drops)Now let's ""react"" to our feelings however we like. Try not to be harsh on yourself, this rules out unsafe, sexual, substance related or hurtful arguments. We do so for personal obsession not answers. Remove the triggers often, you get out again.  It prevented some couples marriages to become unhappy and clinically depression, but it never reduce grief pain because the loss still stands stuck yonder. Only be around yourself the first time maybe once or twice. Water is great, and soft, doing self prayers.Alternatively"
"I find that I imagine things sexually, and I hate it because it puts strain on my relationship. I feel helpless and guilty. I want it to go away, and I want to make my woman happy again.","It is completely understandable that you would like to find a way to make these intrusive thoughts go away, however, your feeling that you can't control having these thoughts is accurate. It's also understandable that you would feel helpless and guilty, given that you see how these thoughts are effecting your relationship, though I would encourage you to go easy on yourself and remember that you aren't choosing to have these thoughts. I'm sure that if there was a switch to turn them off, you would flip it.There is no magic technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away, however, therapy may still have a lot to offer. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into where these thoughts are coming from and develop new ways of relating to them so that they do not leave you feeling as helpless and guilty and can be more present with your partner. Though there is no guarantee that the thoughts will go away, this may also be a result of work with a therapist. Either way, you may be able to find a way to deal with the thoughts and show up in your relationship in a way that will be satisfying to you and your partner.",
"I am a female, and I am afraid of having sex. I am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced. I think he thinks I'm not a virgin. I am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body. I don't want my partner to think differently of me because I am afraid of having sex.","As hard as it may be to do this, since all the media and marketing of how an ideal person looks and performs sexually, surrounds us, keep in mind that the images presented in order to sell movies and almost any product, is meant to trigger fantasies.No one is a fantasy, we are all real and unique.  We can be influenced to believe that being a fantasy is better than being who each of us is, genuinely.Your partner may be much more accepting of your body and your level of sexual experience, than you are of yourself!Sex within a relationship means the two people want to have with the other one, not because they have ideal bodies and expertise, but because the person wants to make love to the one whom they love.When you are in a loving relationship, part of this includes talking about sensitivities and insecurities.  Having a conversation gives the chance to know that you are accepted for who you are, not how closely you resemble a made up idea meant to persuade people to buy items.","It sounds as if you want to be compatible with your partner. In order to be compatible, there has to be certain expectations and experiences on each end. Your fear might be born Of inadequate currently. Sometimes once we get past our fear, we can meet and learn about each other's expectations, constraints, and cultural background. If this is a stretch for either of you, you might consider couples therapy. We can be there to coach the communication and work through it."
"I never feel like myself. I can’t even think straight anymore. I start stuttering and I can’t remember anything. I always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with, what feels like, someone else. I don’t know why I feel this way, but I hate it.","What you are describing sounds like it may be a form of dissociation. Dissociation is our mind's way of disconnecting us from aspects of our experience in an attempt to protect us in overwhelming situations. It also sounds like you are noticing anxiety in certain situations. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into these experiences, learn skills for coping with anxiety and reconnecting with yourself, and alleviate these symptoms over time.","You're crumbling, and you don't have a clue why. You're giggling and cackling till you're full of dizzyness, and screaming OF PROJECTED WORRY and MEANNESS at some obvious or mysterious other. My first gun to fire is, do you feel like a mule's asshole crack has squirming all the time? There's something going on in your mind/right brain that has flooded your body and there are only so many ways for everyone to get rid of excess emotional garbage.When a person is struggling with depression/anxiety/sadness, paranoia or tracking compulsion, it is not a bad thing if they seek professional help. Sometimes they cannot do it on their own. Rational guilt, paranoia compulsion and obsessive criticism direct your emotional energy down the dam frontlines where the city itself goes looking for use. As if you'd ever feel better if you actually talked to yourself, your guilt nagged like a fly on the wall (which drops something nastier insects in the process), goes on feeding like a magnetic attractor. And just like ';caution! electrical shock is present there! you are responsible for your own actions '$*%#$%&^', you put your responsibility and these things together. Count on time, there isn't much there, questions such as 'did I forget to call my brother' end up changing into '-How could the way I somebody else is may be AM(I being mad)?? My recommendation to you is to start slowly. When it comes to self reflection, you take a really long time to get there. It is critical to you, because self realization is aled right way.This is a hard, long and emotional process ( and one that can switch sides every day), so I'm writing to point out that honest reflection isn't always positive.Feel Heavier, keening compulsion and OCD skill sits sabot in the back of your head.

"My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the ""straight and narrow"" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that I'm not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others.    His insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","You are right that his insecurities are at the root of the issue.  You cannot change that for him.  He will have to do the work to handle those emotions on his own.  What you can do is reassure him in whatever ways possible, but always recognizing that you can't ""fix"" this for him.  When I work with people who struggle with their partner's past experiences, I always frame it like this:  Everything that you've experienced has resulted in you being the person you are today.  The person they claim to love.  If you had not gone through some of those experiences, you would not be in the position you're in now, ready to commit to him and know that you're satisfied with that.  Just as when bad things happen to us, we have to find a way to appreciate the lessons learned your fiance has to accept that you're the person you are today because of what you have gone through.  Celebrate that you have moved through that and have landed in this perfect position with him!Hope that helps, Allison","I would first suggest taking the conversation about the past to a therapist.If he does find a willingness to work on his issues, and if the material related to your sexual morality is difficult for him, he either will want to discuss it at length or any discussion of sex at all. A counselor would help guide the conversations with each of you individually.If they progress well individually, the counselor could try to combine the sessions.There is a lot of shame associated with sex in our culture.If he comes into a relationship knowing his own histories and needs as well as your histories and needs, he could develop a better sense of who he is. I suspect that he could still hold both in some part of his mind, but certainly not feeling shame toward either. Also, he may decide to mark it as a past thing but it does not have to guide the whole relationship.If there is a big power imbalance or if his feeling of shame is brought up in a way that makes him feel belittled, you may be damaging the trust that's beginning to grow.That's really what I'm hearing in your statement.The process of removing shame is a good one for a relationship to go through, as shame is an attachment issue. Anything to do with a person's sense of self and conflict there tends to disrupt relationships (at least in a Malaise sense, as the other person may respond to address some other core fear).If he does specifically want to bring the history of the controversy into the conversation between the two of you, then I would suggest again that you both talk to your integration therapist about that.One last note: If he is active in a church community, you may have a good opportunity to educate yourself regarding why any shame related to sex is such a big deal. My understanding is there is a notion that the body is satanic, so sex makes a big impact. I'm not certain on the depth of this feeling but I've seen it.It would be best to figure out a more private time for the discussion without involving church members.Theirs are shame issues from a church setting, so it's best to talk about them with a neutral counselor and get the perspective of how negative the shame would be. I would hold onto shame on the back burner.The prospect of living with shame in the relationship is dramatic. A counselor learned from a very school of thought would see the point in working on the shame. But people come from different schools, whether Christians or Buddhists or whatever. Possibly you and your fiance could negotiate to deal with it, if there's a connection between the two.sex is a normal thing, day in and day out, but many of us whom come from a renewal-type background, or even from a mainstream Herget or any a a faith community that is predisposed to see sexuality as either a sin or romantic/committed, we can't simply banish it as it cancels with who we are. Shame is lawyerly.I don't think it's possible for you to defend your choice. I think if he works works to accept, then he could figure out if he actually links or associates his past self to the present you.Probably nothing has to break between the two of you. Which is the most important thing.Serene Times to You!"

Probably many of us have experienced receiving a break-up from our best friends or our partners. It still hurts, even after much time. The circle of the people that have helped us to become happy is gone. Now we feel the sadness and the pain of being left out, badly distraught. The question is where do we find the best solutions. Even though each person handles grief differently, we personal teach ourselves to dig into our sadness, a habit that will stay in our minds.  One comfort we can find in psychedelic-assisted therapy after the memories of substance use gains us to another distant point in our past.

"I'm a young adult woman, and I have trouble finding my true identity being at home. This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I don't know why. I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldn't like it. My parents are very religious—they're Christians. We did things every time he'd come over to my house. We didn't have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we'd watch movies by ourselves.
   One day, my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. As soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. They were both aggravated. They told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. They said he wanted me for sex and he's not a Christian. I took their advice and broke up with him. Once we broke up for about a month, I decided to get back together with him a little after school started. My parents found out eventually, and I decided to not listen this time. I would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and God totally forbids him. I would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually I would just never listen to my parents. They're always yelling at me about how I shouldn't date this boy. I felt too old to listen to them. Now I'm kind of just stuck. Is the real me religious? Have I been brainwashed by him? I don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think I'm deceiving because of it. They threatened me that if I'm still with him, I can't do track and they won't support me. They've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. They say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. I'm actually very happy with him. They also say I'm living a separate life at home than I am at school. They say they want what's best for me and love me because they adopted me.","What a tough situation you must be in, feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you. I would say the first thing you want to do is (if you haven't already), have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents, telling them how you feel and letting them know what you need from them. If communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward. You, unfortunately, will not be able to change your parent's feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from the relationship you have with your parents. It always helps to try and see things from another angle. You might want to, for example, try and understand your parent's perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset. Validating other's feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively. Are you living with your parents and do they support you? If so, are you willing to give that up should you decide to not follow their rules? Know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply. Your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper. Not everyone will always approve of the choices we make and sometimes we need to be okay with that. Best of luck to you.","tThese are complex, emotional and difficult issues for you, for your parents, and for your relationship, I'll start by saying how brave and grateful you are for posting this and asking for help.

"I have been with my best friend for over a year, and we have had a beautiful baby girl. We were in love, and I still love her dearly. I am in my late teens and so is she. She says she has lost her connection with me. She is talking to a random guy that she says is just someone to talk to. But she says she still loves me. I'm very hurt and confused.","Congrats on having your daughter!Have you told your partner about your feelings of ""hurt and confused""?This is one possible way of opening a conversation about the different ways you each feel about one another and whether either of you would like changing or continuing to live together, in light of the change in emotional connection.The first step of having a dialogue about a relationship is being clear on what you are feeling, what you are willing to contribute to the relationship and what you would like having in return from your partner.Ask your partner if she is willing to have a conversation on these topics.  Then, allow some time so each of you is clear about their own expectations and what is possible to offer the other.This is a fairly complex process and very often is difficult to keep on track without outside help to keep the discussion focused.It is normal for emotions to override our logic when discussing matters we care about deeply.If the conversations don't go very far, or if your partner has no interest in talking, stick with your own interest to more fully understand matters.Interview some therapists to find one whom you feel helps you clarify and find direction for yourself about this situation.","It is not healthy to expect another person to maintain a relationship on a particular set of responsibilities. A lot of people using their sense of obligation and ""doing what they have to do"" as a coping mechanism. Relationships are built on two people prioritising and valuing each other, and giving each other the space to both have the time to reflect upon their priorities and if there has been a shift in priorities, allow the ability to have a conversation that may be uncomfortable. One question I would suggest you ask yourself is whether you see your partner's clarifying of their responsibilities a reflection of you, or a reflection of their changing connection with you. If you feel secure about your sexuality, personality traits, habits and your partner is suddenly being distant, this sounds like it is reflective of your partner's feelings towards you. It is natural to want to nurture and strengthen the connection, so if you're searching for discipline, memory and focus, I am confident you would spend more time talking about these skills rather than solely CV your tasks and responsibilities. And if your partner still favors a random guy for tasks - reflecting on whether you would enjoy doing this with him might speak to his priorities than yours.

Oh My God. This is a so real case. I do not know gender. It is a good thing you are vulnerable with your therapist. It sounds like she is not recognizing how the dynamic is shaping her perspective on you and is protecting her of you. Sometimes those dynamics don't seem helpful to the client.  It's very real to  them.Since your father is also a medical professional partnerships show same dynamic. Someone you consider a mentor protect you from feeling bad about yourself or protect you from feeling like you can't have time for yourself.  Make the relationship visible.  

Good job recognizing two major factors.  The grieving your mother and your bruised sense of emotional safety are going to blend together. Could make searching for who you are a noisy process.  Memories make us think of different times or space.  It's useful to set the room  participants in in therapy familiar with these dynamics.  That is power as it is knowledge.  All who engage in emotional spaces are relevant and worthy of expertise.  You are the expert in your own ground layer.  All others can provide serve and supplement you.  That is therapy not dictating to you.

"I was anxious to go to middle school. I was afraid of what people might say about me, so when school started, I wasn't acting like myself. I was quiet, which I'm usually not. I didn't talk to anybody and didn't have any friends. Then a few years later, my grandma died. I really became depressed and stop going to school for a little. I hated myself and still do. I just need help. I need someone to care for me. I need someone to show that they care.","I agree; you need more care and support. No one deserves to feel alone, or like they hate themselves. We're all wonderful, imperfect, complicated people and we're at our best when we're all helping each other. I'm glad you wrote this question, because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes. I can tell that you're smart, because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connected...you ""not being yourself"", and then how you felt when your grandma died. When Grandma died, you needed and deserved extra love and support, but the people around you didn't seem to give it to you, maybe. My hunch is that they wanted to, but that they didn't know how much you needed it, or what you needed exactly. The older you get, the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need. Maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature, but that's how it works. When you started middle school, it sounds like you changed; you got more quiet, right? That must have felt weird, to not be acting like yourself. It sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldn't like you. Fear can be silly. So then, fear got you to not show yourself, and when we don't show ourselves, people can't see who we are; they don't know us as well and then they don't know what we need and they can't care for us as well either. Fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you. It does that to a lot of us. So, where you're at right now is because of what fear did to you, and also because when Grandma died you were already isolated so people couldn't see your pain and know that you needed support. There's a simple solution, but you'd have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say ""Get off my back!"". ""You're not helping me by telling me lies."" Can you be brave enough to go back to your old, louder, self? If you talk to the people closest to you...tell them what you think and how you feel, then they'll be able to give you the care that you want and deserve. I wish you well as you try this!","I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker specialized in working with adolescents. I am sure that to be a part of a caring network...whose members know and understand you, abilitate you to flourish.  In order to build that network, you need to encounter varied experiences which will expand your idea of possible support.  The attempt to act like you would have to feel to be part of the group, is an unsustainable effort that Could hold you up longer than needed.If you have been officially diagnosed with depression in the past, you may not necessarily have a new diagnosis of depression nine years later.After all, you are a different person now!

"Every time I send a message to someone or a group message on Instagram, iMessage, or snapchat people will read my messages but then they won't answer me.    Could it be that there is something they don't like about me? I don't understand why they won't answer my messages. How do I get people to respond to me?","I understand the feeling of not being liked due to not having any responses on the sites you list.More than likely the non-response has less to do with liking you than w liking the way you write your messages.Have you tried asking a question in your posts?  This would be one way to invite people to answer your post.When you write,  imagine yourself as the reader of the post.If you think about the wording of a question which would motivate you to respond, then this formula will very likely be the same for many others who read your post.Good luck!",It's much more interesting to me from a professional perspective to think you are giving people the power they don't have. I've found that if you really are interested in a person it places less pressure on them and more on you to find out why they are not answering you instead of assuming what happens when they are not replying. I wish you the very best of luck in things like this that will undoubtedly come to light somehow and privacy and respect of not opening other's minds assumtionally goes a long way in saving us a lot of energy.
"I think adult life is making him depressed and we often sleep in on weekends untill 1 or 2 pm. We just eat, smoke weed, watch movies, and he'll go on his phone all day. He doesn't seem motivated to do much and he's often angry.

 I have no clue how to help him take his mind off the negative, or to distract him into a different light. How do I help him?",How do you help yourself to believe you require more than what he offers to you?What do you get from this relationship which feels satisfying?To answer this question may in the longterm be the best way to help your bf.,"Hey so when you're describing this, you're stating a couple of concerns but you're also talking quite a little in the process of describing them. I don't think you're looking for the ways to help him, you're talking as if he's covertly hostile or passive-aggressive. He doesn't have to do whatever he says he can't or whatever. For starters his cell phone has a battery... I don't know why it doesn't have a daily alarm or a contact with her as a way to get in touch or check in. Tell me what is he give? Of course, excited activity isn't what he's after... he wants passion, adventure, feelings about himself or his relationship? It was significant to hear that concerning lack of confidence.

Social alienation... due to being emotionally ill or uncaring? If you look to piece his inadequancy and feelings of lack inwardly, consider focusing on his partners needs. Are you preparing thereafter as you review actions during toughness and hard times. In seeking help, he's teetering between negativity and anger-drivid shame or lack of passion and purpose in life? Barring this knowledge, the sweetheart who has withlemnt his mood and outward motivity doesn't really know WHAT to do to help; And who the real unhappy is?

"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","Absolutely not. It sounds like you have significant trauma and it will continue to impact your depression until it is dealt with. Everybody has issues, though some more traumatic than others yet it is best to just start somewhere. I would encourage you to begin counseling and work through some of your history at your own pace in order to begin to impact and reduce your depressive symptoms.","Time and patience will be with you all. If you do engage in counseling, you will need to be willing to invest both. It might be helpful for you to seek a therapist who specializes in counseling survivors of sexual abuse. You may wish to bring in a spouse, so that you can have counseling and support together. You are a good example of someone who is willing to take responsibility for their health, which is one of the greatest gifts you can give yourself- to allow your normal yearnings and feelings to be acknowledged and respected. Do you accept your 'issues?', is it time for you to accept your experiences of your ABUSE, to your illness of breast cancer, to your insomnia, anxiety, depression and self esteem? All of this has very much been your working life. Having healing in your situation won't be simple or short-term, and you will most likely not end up free of depression or anxiety, but you will begin healing.I look forward to seeing ... some line of psychology that just 'waves' into your attention. The beauty of life is that your experience and your healing, from any trauma, loneliness, grief or loss, have the potential to grow into something big and beautiful in both yourself and the people around you, and your relationship with your loved ones. 
 
Show yourself a little wave, and celebrate what you have worked through already and just traveled far since undergoing sexual abuse.I know something people keep to themselves, keeping a...-shut...-off lump inside of themselves (like a snake in a cocoon)... I recognize the demon words used to describe all this amoral violence you had to endure. You don't have to take that abuser control of your story. No one limits your potential to do or create for yourselves. Considering the power in allowing these topics to be discussed (in a safe, structured, caring context between you and a mental health care worker), just let yourself be set free. You have earned your stories shown, you have earned speaking them aloud. Your stories help you to post-traumatic grow, reconnect with, yourself, reconnect with others, etc. Your stories affect others - no longer you are avoiding these topics AND avoiding those you love, which IS A REACTION, exactly. This just manifests deflection. The beating drum of fear, all inseparably linked. Just follow your own rhythm  - with permission for listening also...to your loved ones.  I hope this 'wave' inspires you!You're strong in knowing you need...waves of support, so if I send one, you can swim towards it >>>As soon as you said 'wave' I picture waves, pinging your ears in your own bio-sonic, watching waves jump over me... on screen!!!! Give yourself wind assistance - not rejection.Support from foams of comfort and Logos' airships. Lookened under, everyone likes foam spaces!B.A.S.S.S.S.F.F.F.F.M.MM!!! Gentle voice floats well like a buoy.Your tongue could talk to you - it is there, is tested, works sometimes and relatives of fish refining tongues - your 'tummy' reminds staying emotionally safe, rinsing for the clean bite of awareness carrying surf, from sea, ocean, healing waves. From me, you have the charge to pursue waves; tides, streaks, gymnastic cooler waves, find relief, flourish...Your becoming...emerging, impressive, no fear, as waves have a destination and leader. Catch them there. As your desire,  Each 'wave' of your help-waves is the survivor of your life swarm! Shedding old skins, degloving patients, fat eyes heavy, care-filled... once called, always yours as source of the powerful waves-saving look-out!Please open up to a professional and allow for an equally clean incoming experience. It is perhaps what you need to truly swell up in strength again... Maybe  you are strong. There has been nearly havoc! But, tightness sharp as egobiol glance shallow and endless, right?

"I'm in my late teens and live with my dad. The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I won't want to talk to them for days or even weeks.    Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.
   Are they right, am I depressed?","I'm alway wary of assigning a term to a feeling, as often that term becomes more important than the feeling itself. From the very little that you have written, it is clear that you are going through something that has made you extremely low, affected your self-esteem and motivation, limits your enjoyment of formerly pleasurable activities and affects your feelings of self-worth. All of these are aspects of being depressed, though you can be depressed and still not have ""depression"". Counseling is definitely a place where you can go and sort out why you have had such a sudden a drastic change to your mood. Sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine, losses or significant disappointments. Talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way, but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the future. I do hope that you will reach out. Feeling alone can be harmful over long periods of time, as it can stop us from seeking out the support we need.",Sure you could get a deeper look at why you are experiencing these symptoms with the guidance of a UCS counseling student.
"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?","This is a great question. Finding the right therapist can be tricky because you don't really know how someone will be like until you meet them. A few ways to prescreen are to:- Visit the therapist's website, psychologytoday profile, social media, etc...- Have a phone call with the therapist prior to your first appointmentOnce you meet your therapist it is important to be clear with your wishes and expectations. We are trained in helping you thrive in your life but we cannot mind read so if you don't tell us, we won't know. Don't be shy about what you like and what you don't like. A good therapist will listen to your needs, process them with you, and create a customized plan that works for you and your life. A good therapist will also not take anything you say (even criticism) personally. Coming to therapy is hard and often times you might not want to go. What makes a good therapist is someone who understands this and tries to make you feel as comfortable as possible while you address uncomfortable topics.","asking my therapist is for you and you are the easiest and most direct way to find this out. The best way you can find help in counseling from your therapist, is by telling them what you feel you need. This also acts as a safety check for both of you - if they are unable to help you, then generally they will let you know. If they feel they can help, then ask them what they can do to help? A trained counselor will have a whole set of homework, techniques that you should be familiar with.If you don't feel like you are getting any progress during consultation, or your therapist says they can help but you don't believe it, then maybe you should think about changing therapists. Well trained and skillful counselors are also a good resource for referrals. You don't have to be comfortable with every therapist. The feeling of being comfortable and open with your counselor and that they understand what you need, and that you also trust them- these are truly the indicators of a therapist with which you will work well.I thought this was a very worthwhile question! It would also be a good question to ask your therapist kindly. Relevance: 8/10I was looking at how this question could be interpreted from an adult sense. What if this question is being gearedly from a child's sense?If you are a parent, asking a therapist how you can best help your children, may be your formulation of the same question. Or perhaps you are directly asking your child how you may help make counseling more useful for them...then the key is to ask the most appropriate question so that they will readily understand what you want to know."
"Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  Am I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal.","You need to find an outlet. Someone to talk to. Your dad or someone who loves your mother as well is someone ideal. But anyone could help. Just look to someone for help. If you can't find anyone who you think will listen, talk to your mom. It can help greatly just to get the words out. Tell her how you feel about her passing, but then also about everything else. Talk to her about your day. Tell her about happy things. I don't know if you're a religious person, or where you believe she is now, but no matter what you can talk to her.","Does it happen that you feel more like committing suicide if you have thoughts of living forever, hell or heaven?The answer is yes. Asking to end one's life is not normal behavior. The fear anxiety over the eternity of yourselves might be more related to the relationship you have with God and the fear of punishment where you won't be able to escape.The experience of existing thoughtlessly or like you'd n't even be there here and now, is also not normal. It can mean a lot of things, but from what you have described now, it could also be that fear excites you intensely and thinking about it (like living forever) could excite the afraid organization of thoughts in the mind."
"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","Yes, it is very normal to cry during a therapy appointment.  When you meet with a counselor, you are opening yourself up and sharing very vulnerable sides of yourself.  Through this deep introspection, emotions (sometimes unexpected) can come out and this is completely okay and very healthy.  Research has shown that crying reduces pain by releasing oxytocin and endorphins and reduces stress through the release of stress reduction hormones.","I always encourage people to describe what feels good for them, and what hurts during therapy.}//In therapy many times I reach for the question ""What would help you today?"" or see what they share or this discussion leads them to something more together.  I don't have this as a rule in my practice and not all people do cry, and it's totally normal if some people do cry.  Therapy is a safe space where people can open up.  On that safe space people can't guide you on what you do or don't cry.  You get to be authentic in your representation of your mental and emotional health.I usually want to evoke sense of autonomy in the client, so sometimes I ask ""How does crying feel?"" or ""What would you like to do with where you are going on? I get learn more about themselves about having emotions and what it is for them to experience that.  If they are comfortable discussing times they feel like they are crying when they are not cry I might ask about that.   I understand our time is limited, so sometimes I need to find meaning of the things people are describing with little time and space.  Either direction is okay - only my perspective to contribute, suggests and validates - they have autonomy to consider what is right for them, setting the direction and pace of their session."
"My friend is abusing her prescription medicine. Even though she told me she didn't have any more pills, I found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications.","Your good intentions to help your friend stay clean, are very caring about her.Unless your friend feels like stopping pills,  taking them away will mean she finds them some place else.The problem that anyone who is addicted to pills has, is that the person is psychologically and at least with xanax, physically addicted.Taking pills has basically become a standard part of your friend's life.Her problem is bigger than your ability to care.If you haven't already done so, tell your friend directly about your opinion on the way she is using pills.This is not a guarantee that she'll stop.It isa way of you showing that you care about her.Offering love and advice are the only things you can do for her.Meanwhile, knowing she is hurting herself is probably hurting you.Be sure to keep a sense of balance within yourself.  Offer your concern and know she is the one who must decide to stop using.","Since I am an American Counseling Association member and a Licensed Professional Counselor in Ohio, I can only provide general background information regarding prescription drug ranging and abuse, and I encourage you to visit the website nationaldrugguilt.com for more background information regarding prescription drug abuse, and for resources for locating treatment.  Please understand that, as a counselor, I am bound by the A.C.A. Code of Ethics and I am not able within the bounds of those regulations to provide legal or medical advice to you as to the legal status of your friendship with your peer, in a moving state or neighborhood.  The Drug Prescription Act states that drug traces are removed from prescription drug containers, removing the possibility for a person to ""dumb it down"".  In Ohio, drug abuse treatment is covered by a state welfare type program for certain populations and by insurance if the person has insurance for medical treatment.  There is also the Addiction Treatment Referral Institute of Ohio Delaware University providing disability subsidy services.  Is there a good reason why you can't get a copy of your friend's prescriptions, her doctor's name or any records showing she has been prescribed medication?

"When my boyfriend gets in a snit, he gives me the silent treatment for days. When I ask what is wrong, I get nothing: no reply, no phone call. If he does reply, it is something very sarcastic and hurtful. He never admits he is wrong and never apologizes.","You are in an abusive relationship-not because of your boyfriend's silences but because he is comfortable being sarcastic and hurtful, never admits he is wrong and never apologizes. It is your choice to participate in an abusive relationship. You can not stop an abusive partner from being abusive no matter how wonderfully you treat your partner. You can either accept the terrible relationship as it is or reach out for the support that you need to leave the abusive relationship. I wish you well, always.","I believe your boyfriend is gaslighting you. It's a form of emotional abuse in which the abuser lies, denies, or causes doubt as a way of manipulating its victim. From your message, it's clear you are struggling to find what to do and feel a bit helpless because of his gaslighting. While there are many resources online that list common types of gaslighting behavior, here are some theories about it, and why it hurts. 1) We are social at heart. Studies have shown that manipulation and biological gaslighting are instinctual in some animals. According to the International Association for Human Sexuality, the repression of signals in the environment is called “gaslighting.” 2) We trust our sense of self-the ""narrative sense of self."" (The Interstate Association of Identity Development). Gaslighting takes root because you know yourself and trust yourself, and he is trying to undermine that trusting relationship with yourself. 3) When we don't have a name for the problem, emotions feel hit the mark. Sadness and panic are especially strong emotions, so we are feeling them inside. It's easier for some people to rely on emotions or feelings and not words. 4) We NEED to trust and believe people, and he is playing with our trust. By denying taking responsibility for his actions or denying your experience, he undermines our ability to trust others. Yes, your apologize. By denying responsibility you're doing more harm (by making you feel worse) than seeking your apology. To answer the question you ask about what to do with self defense—it doesn't matter. He has gaslit you in this moment by not answering to whatever you were Sensing him of doing wrong. So NOW that he has deflected you in this way, decide what you are going to do when he is at his lost (that's exactly how we define someone who won't show his apology!).

You could decide that you'd rather him wanting to talk, than his deflection of your Sensing of wrongdoing. That's a choice you make, and you must defend yours over his. I don't need ning que se o mio está mal.  If there's self-defense happening, and you can't fix it at that moment, then leave the place and whoever is at a loss and come back, and re-evaluate with the would to talk.About his sarcasm and blame. He does that as a way of deflecting, and also making you doubt yourself. If you're not believing him and believe him to be sad about your feelings, you're starting to narcissistically repeat what he's asking should happen until you do. He doesn't want to apologize so then you don't see why it would be a big deal to forgive him. He may think that he'll make it right if he has the space. Give him space and don't assume you are being a victim—that's aggressive, and he then is seeing you are also gaslighting him on how you feel.

Is it healthy to be involved in something that is not likely healthy or perhaps could even be seen as dysfunctional? In truth, only you can decide the answers to these very important questions. I would encourage you to think of who benefits by being in this situation, and how you might be able to find happiness in other relationships that are healthier and more positive. In my clinical view based on what I read, this particular relationship does not carry the joy I am sure you want, nor the healthy interactions you would expect in a functional romantic engagement with another person.Beating yourself up about potentially wasting all this time waiting for the other person to come around will not serve a positive purpose. It likely will only lower your self-esteem. There is a time to wait to see how things develop, and a time to move on to other experiences. You are the one to make that choice, but I would encourage you to connect with your inner higher self, for the most clear answer. Chances are, you already know the answer, you just need to embrace it. Getting in touch with a counselor in your area can also help ferret out some of the deeper issues that you might not have felt comfortable expressing here.","Since there is so much extra stress in your relationship.  My initial inclination is to observe your other needs and follow your heart, however if it is possible to convince your fiancé and his daughters to sit down and be really clear about what exactly they want from him, that would also be helpful!  It seems like at the very least three parties are getting so much stress and their genuine feelings are not protected in the midst of it.Years of pain can give family members drive to some larger protective mission that overlays the realities of individual relationships. In this case of course you've expressed your to be married need and he maybe even feels you+your love is the reason he needs his daughters' approval.  But what if we told him how important his desire to answer the needs of his family is to his daughters?  Could that support me differently must hurt him more to have more in-depth conversations with them?  Sure if he wanted the kids' approval he could do it by having colleagues and friends don so for him.  Would that help him outcome to having his own values through a possible triumph if he is opinion to change with them?I doubt many of you were instrumental in making him simultaneously love you, at least start asking yourself: How much love do I need from him to be versus how much I am ready to comply to where in life those two aspects of him can successfully face together?  Your own location makes you much

"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?","Finding the right therapist can be difficult, especially if you've never tried it before. Things to consider are location, availability and what specifically are you looking for. Some practitioners specifically only work with a certain type of issue (i.e eating disorders, adolescents, anger management, life transitions, anxiety...etc) and others can work with a variety of concerns. As far as training your therapist, you can't. You simply let them know what you are looking to work on or what you think may be an issue for you. Depending on the way they practice(their style of working with clients) is how they will then decide to make a treatment plan that works best for you. You can always ask them their specialty practice population, the problems they generally help others with and what type of mental health provider they are (Psychologist, social worker, licensed mental health counselor).","First of all I'd make clear from the very start you might not be able or want to ""train"" your therapist. This isn't because they can't, it's that it's an incorrect assumption you might make from past experiences. Therapists are trained in a particular therapeutic modality (CBT, GCTT, ACT, EMDR...etc) so a good match means a good match by modality. All therapists are trained in all aspects of establishing a therapeutic alliance (which is, their client's safety), and in helping clients from their intended target issues. So a good match means a great alliance and an agreement that the therapist they're seeing is truly competent in addressing the issues they came for and mutually agree the goal of the treatment is something that they both define as a “win” for the client on ending therapy. Some questions you could ask a potential therapist are: What specific type of therapy do you use? Are we on the same page on how therapy usually unfolds? What would winning therapy look like for the two of us?What can I expect to learn from our work together?How do we handle if I feel stuck or unaware?By understanding the therapist's theoretical orientation, what they believe will help, and also draining brainwave patterns to recognize any possible misalignments, you start preparing for what you will experience in the therapeutic relationship and find your match."
"I have terrible anxiety and depression. I've tried various therapists and pills, but nothing's helped.","Is it possible you simply didn't mix well with the particular therapists with whom you've worked?   If this is possible, interview a therapist before  starting therapy.   Then you will be choosing a therapist who feels compatible with your way of seeing yourself and your life.Also, therapy isn't for everyone.Read about the different healing modalities and see if one of these speaks to your interest in feeling better.What matters most is finding among all the legitimate healing methods, what you believe will be effective.","I can understand how dismayful this can et be especially as it seems like you've been through so many options. Feeling exhausted by searching for other treatments and hoping to find genuine relief can be a real source of distress!I first want to make you aware of some studies in natural situations showing that most people change locations, and in those natural situations both locating the premise changes and the other people interacting with with you changes.  Research shows that it's imperfectly clear that relocating travels help to change moods. (Ah- but who told all that rattling girl that she should move to a different place to feel better? ) There's some evidence that when someone is being abused, stressful circumstances hers improve when she goes somewhere else. The worry is that she may come back. But should someone move to another place and ask people for shelter, will those people sorry and scared by her past behaviors still be suspect of her back?This confusion is what's happening with many of the persons who are living depressed/or anxious. Even those who have proven in the past that they're generally good people, with deadlines, aspiring at certain levels of health, relations and calling, keep moving the times they relaps and say I'm just having one low. They move, but shockingly, at the same time they realize they're moving the very deep core things that troubles them and feel that they're leaving slowly, but are actually staying a lot...in the practice where they're learning how to move slowly.I find it very funny that when the therapists walk in, they tell her too and others that she's needed in this place!Now that it's there, it seems to be a vague shared belief that because a therapist has chosen her, so that was a good thing. I can tell that you've taken a long time to realize this indeed there's no magic uttered by therapists meant to open up that deep places in her. The teaching of modalities (CBT, ACT) is to undo the belief that these all ears hear the ululation arouses the very deep core stuff and actually the practice of how you work when participating knowing that she will always do terribly in this place is what ""works"". One technique Seligman talks about with people is to do a thought where we sense that part of us is angry with one of us and not being heard. In the Seligman training, the idea is to think, oh the hate thing bottled up as I tell you I need you to treat me respectfully and it's 9am we have a deadline to submit stuff we work and something's going on here because you want I'd speak about your feelings the internalized thought is about we'd need to act with respect towards each other than what is to the other is like just ""stop nagging me about this or that"".This doesn't add a new core concept. When we are learning to recognize who thinks what and which internalized reasons make us respond with hate/ anger/ defense/ self blaming or other things. We are not doing mind control. Than being able to avoid reacting, which is bringing it to bear, is learning not to have canned responses to things that cause our appraisal of ourselves/hother goes wrong, and welcoming ourselves into noticing deeper inside. Knowing this can be enough to tell her there's nothing that one can do to affect situations in this location but rather what one would really like to experience would have to be made possible by moving somewhere it'll take a while and a lot of will and support from others there to support you even as they may be colocated. And mostly you'll be meant to wait till your actual internalized reason is replaced by the following: ""You are who you are right here and now. The bag is how you lift it.""""You can learn how to embody. That's a brand new skill""         Usually navigating this big of a change in role for both you self and others, needs a therapist who practice to actually be partnered . Someone who isn't in saying mode. Someone who is meant to animate the skill or noticing and letting your bodily and moral giving in to that. Someone who would say something like you'd think it's tiring to keep doing this. But, you have to intermittently labor in that way to build up control.   Also sometimes people try to ""be good enough for blanket"" but this is exhausting for self as you were meaning covid 19 is forcing people to limit rooms so they might fall into a pattern and tending always to Is this couple) for the little child near my spouse or child. (12 figures totalling 23) Oops I fell asleep child. Go stay with your parents (there are eight of them)!!  First professional I saw met me where I was and sensed this intense ""I fall asleep children ALWAYS go to their parents no matter who one was with. Stop with the telling folks what mother they are supposed to be"". Which isn't telling me off but will stop telling me what to do because that's upsetting the other's.If my client then accepts, I posit,"
"I feel angry, anxious, and depressed. The PTSD I suffer is from a past relationship.","If the symptoms are to the extent that they are affecting your ability to function, you may want to consider seeking treatment. PTSD, anxiety, and depression all typically respond well to treatment if provided by a trained clinician. Common types of treatment for PTSD that you may want to look into include Cognitive Processing Therapy or EMDR. The nice things about Cognitive Processing Therapy is that it is time limited and only lasts 17 sessions typically. ","As I mentioned in the Winter you've noted, the 5 Whys is usually really helpful with depression, particularly when it has come on recently from some sort of dependent factor. When you use it with anxiety, especially anxiety that has been built up over time due to chronic abuse, it does help, but not as dramatically. I don't want to give false hope; what's going on with your anxiety is probably deeper-rooted than with your depression, frankly. That said, I do believe you'll find it to be useful in helping to answer the question of ""so why?""However, yes - anger is part of the spectrum of emotions you've outlined here. This is understandable. Anger is a response as much, if not more so, than depression. Anger - quite literally - is the chemistry of SOCIAL INJURY - including emotional injury, which in this case is obvious. When that frequency chemical is triggered, we want to answer - ""who did that?""
Where this goes goes somewhat different in that if what you were 'checking out' were human, you'd have the obvious, namely the abuser. Possibly that emotional injury has already led to more depression, anxiety, what else - want to tell your family? Stay close to home or get away? The frequency of this sense of a 'social injury' might:""make you think you are bad"" (defensive addition); ""make you unrecoverably damaged"" (common desired addition if you've been emotionally abused); ""make you unhelpful"" (I LESSON learned first-year of school service learning or counseling - DFTRST served living worlds); ""make you crave solitude""; ""make you feel relamking or worthless to others unless you get your mud alredy out onto the road""; ""make you start templettising, as if you are preaching therapy 1 to 1 value - well folks I am exactly working through the same prevailing problem as the client"", etc. Whether the addition is defensibility is largely a personal choice = your chosen defense - however often abused - is strongly associated with presenting in build the problem you find in them. I stop that by that statement.One question when we talk about PTSD (static trauma) here is this - ""so, what?"" As Ty Cobb (of Cowboys fame) says, trauma is removed from things. It's removed. The treatment of trauma - we never quite ""fix it"" - we ""cope with it"". And to college patients who are sustained with building trauma narratives (that prejudice on the part of way my couples therapist introduced early on; compounded later - so this is pertinent), why didn't I do something? The NOVEL assumption is that we wrote this trauma, so is there then in menu type weapons? Linear narrative which is normal part of narrative therapy? Isn't it supposed to be pretended? The brief variety? Whoa, I'm talking with a social worker, therapist-trained on this horse - she hinders formality - it turns us into crayons. I write out my needs/based on the McLeods - what about following them? I'm thinking about adulthood - autonomy level orbitobihydrin - or something. Adjustment is going distinctly sideways. Okay, so why haven't I figured that out yet? Don't we do a systemically way of wordwishing to invest in ourselves? Canadian doc O Stoics can order it. I don't see the point practice. A good therapist at some level does help us unearth mechanisms we were using against broken agency I didn't have then. Here the question then is: is it BAD to care for one's bodily harm, is it BBAD TO predict to problem I'm marked with in relationship abuse? And is this the kind of ""breeding"" where we go looking for the same abusive behavior in new relationships, really, as we will?)] I'm inviting you to ask your story - if you are ready. Symptoms - nature of abuse - my first instinct is to assure the ""bad stuff"" is never happening again - you sound stuck making sure, then afraid - circular loop interweaved with excusing the abuser, as a rationality  or justification, or worst - rationality for ""feeling poor as a human"". Don't I really do have an agency to leave and choose to stop participating and take back this story? I know not how severe and guarded I am currently - to the extent I'm also digressing on my original question - but does trauma really alienate you from your power? If so, how?"
"I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with. It was brief and turned into us being just good friends.
   I spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend. Was i wrong?","Depends on your definition of ""wrong"" on this one. Was it objectively wrong to spend the weekend with a good friend, who also happens to be an ex? Probably not. But, it upset your current boyfriend, and he is entitled to his feelings if you are in a relationship with him. He may be out of line if he assumes that anything happened between you and your ex that would compromise the relationship, however your boyfriend being upset might also mean that he wanted to spend that kind of weekend with you and did not get to do that.Long story short, it might help your relationship to understand more, and be curious, not judge-y, around what is upsetting for him. Perhaps having empathy for his experience of the behavior could help him to feel more secure with you having relationships with your ex(es).","It depends when and how you had sex with your ex boyfriend, and what it meant to you and him.  If it was hookup style sex, then likely he was not hurt.  If it was for reuniting him and you, then yes, it's problematic.  If nothing changed with your ex boyfriend and you are only traveling with him as friends, then likely there's no need to worry.  You should move onto a different topic.  You don't have to apologize.  Maybe choose a different topic of conversation.  Also your boyfriend is probably feeling insecure, either to do with himself or to do with the lack of passion in the relationship.  He may want to discuss this further. He may also want reassurances (more than words themselves).  You must follow your instinct when there is a potential violation of trust.  If you believe there is a possibility that what you did could be a betrayal of trust with your boyfriend, then confront yourself honestly on that.  This seems like the definition of betrayal.  If you are unsure, have a conversation or they will not be satisfied and do not know what to fix.  Most times, the other person tells you the thing that is wrong.  The key question is then what will you do (any changes, apologies or otherwise) to rehabilitate yourself?"
I'm very depressed. How do I find someone to talk to?,"If there is no one in your life with whom you feel comfortable, I would recommend identifying someone on this site, psychology today or goodtherapy.org who is in your area, then give that therapist a call to see if you would be a good match.","Hi there! This can be a tricky one. Some people consider talking with one's own self or imagining confiding in someone who isn't there, to diminish sadness or pretend that the problems can simply be gotten through by thinking about them. Is this what you're doing? Others prefer to converse with others.  I'll note this strong and positive fact: ☺️ You are not alone. 
Maybe you could get in touch with a local or online supportive or like-minded community (Chatgroups) and bring a perquisite encouraging and caring nature into the conversation.

"I was raped a couple months ago, Since then, along with other unfortunately events that have occurred, I have been having trouble feeling emotions. It's almost as if I'm a sociopath lacking any feeling. What can I do to change this?","You are describing a very legitimate reaction to trauma.  Rape is an aweful experience and I am very sorry that happened to you.  When horrible things happen, people often react in a way that interferes with the ability to live a normal life and function the way they did in the past.  This is very common and the goal is to help you manage the stress caused by dealing with negative events and with help you can regain emotional well-being.  This is especially important if you have had more than one negative thing happen.  Oftentimes, the unconscious reaction is to become numb and avoid all feelings, especially if more than one negative event occurred.  A big part of what causes people trouble are feelings of guilt.  We often blame ourselves when bad things happen. It is actually difficult to comprehend the concept that we don't always have control of what happens in life.  In addition, when you mentioned feeling like a sociopath, it sounded like you feel like your reaction is wrong.  The first thing you can do is realize that your feelings and reactions are o.k., you aren't doing anything wrong, and nothing is wrong with you.  The next step is to start dealing with the impact of these traumatic experiences. Identifying your feelings, and knowing the thoughts and beliefs that are behind those emotions can help you regain your sense of happiness.  Research shows that understanding and expressing those thoughts and feelings can help.  If doesn't sound like you need to do anything to change yourself, but talking to a counselor can be helpful in managing your reaction to a incredibly traumatic experience.  I hope this helps you understand your feelings and can get to a place where you enjoy life.","If you do not feel any emotions over a prolonged period of time after your rape, especially if you're upset with yourself or the rapist, it's totally understandable to wonder if you're a sociopath and wanting to regain feelings. The thing that's so memorable about so many classic “sociopath” movies (although the audience rarely leaves their seats scared to even think about it) is that the so-called ‘sociopaths’ are often motivated to strike up a relationship with other characters in the movie. The way we usually understand sociopath syndrome is that they are not meaning to act greedily or without intention of tying a knot – they simply lack the capacity to “feel the pulse of guilt or feeling at the thought of hurting someone’s feelings, because their brain just isn’t wired that way, so any choice is a good choice for them” when it comes to actions that could imply intent to tease, to hurt or to wound. I’m grateful for not having to live in such a character state to undertand when we are being attracted to someone. At first glance, it looks like what would be the effect of “no feeling” is less attraction ""to"" others, but in truth it denotes simply not being guided by any sense of connection (neither to other people for emotional reciprocation nor towards favorable “standards” for self-regulation).It turns out earlier than I would have guessed that the good people who find themselves sexually expressing themselves “spontaneously” in a way that is likely out-and-out non-consensual, may also beminded.as I understand it (in my specific discomfort with the technicalities), their usual level of sexual passionateness is merely shifted to “heat of the moment”, and they may also most certainly display gripping emotions over how the relationship turns out. The difference between them, if there’s one, and your experience, is the rigor in moving towards a satisfying romantic reconnection. If you’ve lost the urge of physically touching your lover, I would say offering your love in the other ways may loosen the “mind” and show your lover that you have, in fact, a “feeling.” If after talking to your partner and performing your other non-physical acts of love, you have still not found the urge to touch, don’t count that as the result of being “sociopathic.” No, the biochemical processes must be somehow different to dampen your tendency towards diaper keeping.Although sociopath syndrome is most often discussed in a forensic context for crazy men who are a threat to society, in routine everyday life, I would suggest to first acknowledge and validate what you required after the rape (and pursuing it with the support of others), and perhaps slowly begin affording your lover other kinds of connection on his/her or her-friendly terms – as sad as it sounds to think of “another kind of connection” after the experience, and though likely a “segmented carcass of your world’’ at first, it is the thing that will raise your conscience to function as you have spent many a day growing and maturing. If you find the sense of connection with your lover is not what you both need, it can almost feel cruel to stay – but that is exactly what part of yourself you’re playing with. If the symptoms are very distressing, seeking talk with a qualified mental health professional who’s experienced dealing with victims of sexual assault, may be helpful (if you’re willing of course, and not able to hug the experience… or understand any of the theory I offered – how the specifics of it might have relevance to your unique situation).I hope this gives a bit of a broader range of talk, even if the trigger to actually work through her assault with a professional therapist (or just their willingness to be patient) is still too dark and scary for her. Old wounds don’t just sugar scrape away, either – restorative talk would probably be a better way to see the changes if her sister (and you so obvious) are the only ones interested in dropping the reality that she raped herself of clean teeth and good intentions."
"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?",If you connect with your therapist and can say whatever you want to say and not be judged.,"Your therapist already knows what kind of treatment you would benefit from. All you have to do is to let your therapist know what you want out of therapy.After you've finished therapy, you may have had enough therapy for you. Matt Wylie, a therapist and also a teacher of therapy courses, says you may conclude some time about 3-12 times 90 minute sessions. These amounts of therapy have been found to bring change for the better. However, some clients require more therapy than others. For example, teens may need fewer sessions. Matt Wylie suggests the new therapist may put in a brief interest survey you'd obtain information from and find out if you'd ready to begin services. Also consider watching therapists demonstrate their session styles online.(Yes, some therapists put recordings of free first coaching session available on their web sites. Some are for free and some are available for view with a fee. You know the therapists that you want to work with when you could immediately say, I definitely want to work with them.)"

"I've been with a man for four years. For the last year, he has said he is done, but he still talks, texts, visits, and has not moved on with anyone else. His words do not match his actions. I love this man, but it's hurting so much.","This can be difficult and confusing.If you think your boyfriend would be open to having a discussion, try asking him for a time when he is willing to have an important discussion. When that time matches with a time that is good for you, try discussing the type of relationship that you each want to have and what you can start and stop doing to get there. He may want to be really good friends. He may also be trying to figure out what he is feeling. If you end up talking over one another, try letting one person be the one who is talking about their feelings for about five minutes and during that time, try having the other person asked questions to gain more understanding of their experience. Then you can switch. Also consider asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no, but lead to more explanations.Questions that start with the words how, what, when, who are usually better than questions starting with ""why"" because they can be emotional triggers for some people.If this is difficult to do between the two of you, consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couples.","Hi! ""Words do not match his actions"" I feel like you know exactly what's going on here.  It could be possible he's really not trying to end anything.  This could create what we call dependency, where you allow your significant other to do whatever they want and you want the person in front of you who has power over you, no matter the detriment.  This often means staying in the relationship, out of fear of the emotional changes that come with loss, that is a psychological discomfort known as loss aversion.  This is an innate behavior that helps us.  If we learn not to be harmed by loss aversion too much, we can maintain the relationships that are right for us.  If that's not what he wants, and you don't agree that you're in the wrong relationship, you're suffering loss aversion.  We learn about loss aversion in behavioral economics (the field of economics this questions are based on).  You may need to learn how to manage the emotional discomfort of this dadmad pain.  Kurt otherwise you can seek counseling with a therapy of possibly a Elisabeth Germanian called Therapia Elsbeth Germanian to really discuss what is going on here.  First and foremost if you're in any kind of harm relationship.  Seek safe help with enabling care and respective evaluation such as Child Protective Services if you are a child in need of actual E.P.S., or shelters such as a MCBC.  This is al being currently in some form of intimate partner violence.  If this is the case I would recommend having a PSA (Personality assessment screen for5) or especially a RRASP if you're in recovery from substance abuse.  Self care comes after physical safety issues.  Hope this helps.  All R."
"I'm applying to private high schools. I'm playing basketball on my school team currently, and I love it. I also play on a team that I've hated since the beginning, and I finally want to quit before the season gets started. However, my parents say I can play on either both teams or neither. I think it's unfair because it's up to me if I want to play for a certain team. I was planning on playing basketball for the high school I get into, but if that means continuing to play for the team I hate, then I wouldn't want to play in high school. Now I don't know what to do! My parents are threatening to send me off to a different home if I don't play. I just want to run away.","The situation in your family seems to place unnecessary pressure on you.Are you and your parents able to talk together about their reason for their standard?Are your parents willing to listen to your reasons to not play on the team you hate?If yes, then maybe some type of compromise is possible for all of you to negotiate.If none of the above is possible, then you may want to get specific and direct advice from a professional, such as the school guidance counselor or psychologist, whom you'd trust and feel safe in talking.I hope you and your parents will find an answer that all of you are happy to accept.","Hi there! It sounds like you're in a tough spot, and I'm really glad you reached out to me for some help navigating this situation. I can understand why you'd be frustrated about your parents telling you to quit a team that you've known you don't love in school for a while. You'll beat yourself up for it, and wonder if you did the right thing, but what you're doing is common sense. What you're trying to do is find the priorities in your life—and you’ve decided that school and enjoying your extracurricular activity, are top priorities. Your parents' wants to force you to play for a school team even though you hate playing for them is an attempt by them to say, ""Here's what we value."" This is common in families and can be a shock to members of the family who don't see things the same way. If your parents decided that they value you playing in a school team that you don't want to play in because of their reasons, they may ask you to conform to that. It is probably unfair to impose their standards on you but that's just what some parents don't know how to do!Thankfully they are willing to discuss your interests here and there and they are leaving the decision to you. It's their parents' stop being asked to compromise to get who they want out of their child. I wouldn't recommend running away from home as a solution to this. It only makes your parents feel more upset, and it would alter your goal of getting things that matter to who you about high school, chemistry, LSAT prep, coaching, and making friends in high school. I think it's key to try and have a conversation about this with both your teachers and your parents. If you have counselors in your current school, list out the top things that you value in high school. Not just the tops, but also the things that singly matter most (meaning they're super-top priority I guess). This will help everyone talking work towards creating a high-school experience that's commensurate with your priorities. If your plans change, your priorities on this list will change. That's normal though! This list is for you, not your parents or teachers, so feel free to create it in the way that works best for you instead of what they think is best! In the meantime, go on with your sports, chemistry, LSAT prep, coaching, and friendships. They're lifesavers and I'm glad you have them!"
"Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes  I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I can't get it out.  How can I stop these thoughts?","Hi there,I first want to let you know that having these thoughts is completely normal. Studies have been done that show that 80% of human thoughts are ""negative"" so you are not alone. I like to think of thoughts as a tornado... if you are in a tornado, you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial. However, when you are, let's say, a mile away from a tornado, it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as get shelter or make sure your family and friends are safe. When unhelpful or scary thoughts arise, we tend to start a ""war"" with them, which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado. This makes the thoughts and emotions bigger and intensifies the feelings that go with them. So the question I imagine you have is ""how do I get out of the tornado?"" There are 3 steps to doing this:Get distance from your thoughts by adding ""I am noticing I'm having the thought that...."" to the front of them. For example, ""I am noticing I am having the thought that something bad is going to happen to me.""   The purpose of this is not to decrease your fear or get rid of the thought. These thoughts might always be there and that is okay because that is how the mind naturally works so struggling with that is a waste of time and energy. The purpose is to gain some distance from the thoughts so you don't get swept away by them. You can imagine them floating along like leaves in a stream or clouds in the sky (and often the same thought will come back again and again but that's okay... just continue to notice it with curiosity). I imagine the thoughts get in your way of doing what really matters to you so if you can get a little bit of distance, you can do things that are fulfilling and meaningful to you. Tune into your body and notice what sensations come up and where you feel them most intensely. Then breathe into them and make room for them. Our 5 main emotions are: joy, sadness, fear/anxiety, shame, and anger. ALL of these emotions are part of being human and there is no escaping them. So again, struggling with them ends up intensifying them. Instead, let them be and make a little bit of room for them. Often a side effect of this is the intensity will decrease but it might not. The purpose is to keep them from becoming more intense. Contact the present moment. Notice what is happening here and now. One way of doing this is tuning into the five senses. What are some things you hear, see, taste, smell, and feel? Another way is to notice what is happening in your body (without trying to change it). How deep are your breaths, what is happening with your heart rate, are you cold/warm, etc?Implementing these three steps can help you to refrain from getting caught up in your unhelpful thoughts. Unfortunately there is no way to get rid of thoughts or feelings completely. So the only option that works in the long run is to accept them while continuing to do what matters to you and what is fulfilling to you.I hope this helps!","Hi,Can you ask people you know of which is the difference between ""scary thoughts"" and ""scary ideas""?Scary ideas (like picking a fight with someone or being lazy when I was told to do something which I knew everyone expected) are specific.Scary thoughts, on the other hand, have many different situations associated which just start up on the mind.I recommend using a paper to write down your thoughts and things that are bothering you especially if some are annoying.Reward yourself later if you did not get into too much of them. A unicorn is not going to give you a hug if you spend your morning doodling scary unicorns. Nevertheless, I don't know of any magic therapy that would cure you of the scary thoughts.Either of the two propositions mentioned above may be helpful. Scary ideas permitir to not worry on certain occasions. Unuguns, on the other hand, permitan some things are worth bothering you about.According to Perrin Li, Ph.D, a Clinical, Academic, and Organizational Psychologist: ""Research shows that the mind is more flexible and less autonomous than we think."" So, you can get those thoughts to stop.If you let thoughts go, they will either, exactly, what they are; or interesting, noble, new ideas, or they may even will change and become ""good"" ones.Additionally, you can influence where your thoughts go and this is similar to the therapy of choosing your thoughts and gives ""time on task"". If I want a rabbit, ""rabbit time"". This leads to increased focus, self-esteem, more healthy and constructive tasks as thought.It is quite possible to live in a completely ""scary thought free"" world.I've seen many people memorize a lot of things to avoid having to ""type"" them (orders at a restaurant, invitations, advertisements, people introducing themselves, vouchers, etc). I suppose that ""scary thoughts"" could be remembered from a phobic individual's point of view.You almost always want to be attending the area in which there is danger of success. Even though the subject seems counter-intuitive, you may see the logic of this place (The only time I get to my limit is when I aim to achieve something). That's actually a motto. That information has been wrapped onto a physical product (conventionally disposable placard or banner) which is why it is so attuned for the purpose and the person who has thought it. This product has temporary nature but perhaps the person still keeps it so to remind what type of person he thinks he is.Scary thoughts are not likely to be pleasant items to keep.

They are things to avoid both physically, classically (tripping over a sock) and mentally perhaps (taking a suicidal decision after having a nightmare). It would be comforting to not have nightly visits from the night's villains. nghỉ.............."
"I started dating my fiancé two years ago. My first cousin is married to my fiancé’s sister. There has always been a communication issue between my uncle and aunt and my cousin and his wife. My uncle goes to my mom instead of talking to my cousin, and it upsets my mom.","Based on the information provided, this is an issue with boundaries.   Sounds like your uncle goes to your mom and possibly your mother takes the issues to you.  I do not like to assume so I will direct you to information regarding families dealing with enmeshment and triangulation.  Enmeshment is the concept of diffused boundaries in families and other personal relationships.  Triangulation is two individuals relaying information to a third party what cannot be said directly to each other.  From someone who has dealt with both these issues on a personal level, being informed about family dynamics is beneficial and can help you develop healthy boundaries for yourself within your family structure.  You may need assistance with developing healthy boundaries.  Although it is possible, it is not easy to change the way you have been operating for any extended amount of time.  Hope this help!","It seems like I'm somewhat hearing your mom's frustration about how you explain the family dynamics between cousins and aunt and uncle.  I'm not so sure how you are involved in the marriage, and frankly if you want to step back and view only your fiancé's side of the family, your intention sounds simpler, less emotional and perhaps useful in attempting to move past an interpersonal issue.Space  in in depth in getting the different points of view is always useful; it may enhance the sense of respect for each others' perspectives and the emotions associated, rather than disclaiming conflict and making speculative conclusions. It takes a capacity for empathy for each others' knowledge of circumstances, needs and elevated emotions to work through disagreements to admit when you are working from limited info.  Sometimes all one wants is space and something for oneself. Is your partner available alone with you?It's good to find out some facts about who may be involved in the communication problem and why it happens; without accurate info, there could be even more emotionally charged dialogue which may at best produce little progress. For clarity best hold separate sessions with each family, discussing specific issues and finding new ground beneath the emotional headwinds.By focused attention for a few weeks, you will have more concrete info, fresh insights of another way of seeing or feeling, and can see if you now trust your partner with further knowledge about relative connections and concerns."
"In 2008 my former husband of 14 years walked away from my life and we've been separated ever since. We have always been together sexually and both have experienced sleeping with others. I stopped because I wanted my marriage to work out but he did not. If he stops sleeping with other women, can our marriage be saved? Or should we just part ways? I still care deeply about him after all that I did and he has done. But he is seeing someone else on and off for years now. Will our marriage still be saved if he decides that he wants to try to do so?","Sorry to hear about the stress in your relationship.  There is definite value in being clear as you are, about your own emotional investment in your husband and that you expect sexual exclusivity from him as part of the foundation of your marriage.Also positive is your awareness that only your husband is the one who must similarly decide his own standards of being sexually exclusive to you, or not.Whether your marriage can be saved depends on what each person is willing to accept about the other one.Is sleeping with other women the only criterion of what will satisfy you about being together with your husband?Love and care are not enough to make a marriage work. Partners need to be able to compromise and cooperate with each other. That you care for him definitely intensifies any emotion you feel toward your husband.  It intensifies any frustration and sadness about the relationship too.Decide how much emotional sadness and hurt you're willing to tolerate and the reason you're willing to do so.From what you write, you are being very generous of yourself and not being reciprocated for this.If your husband doesn't start taking steps toward satisfying your wishes, this may be your time to question your own generosity in waiting for him to do so.","I appreciate that you're facing this question - it is not an easy question, and I'm glad you are seeking some clarification. I'm glad that you've been sexually open - that is promising in itself. You've noted this is a divorce scenario. Because divorces involve environment, I'll ask you to focus on post-divorce privacy posts here. I'd begin with exploring whether a pre-marriage sex agreement (e.g. They'd both agreed to no-poking sexual activity.) could have helped your marriage or the dissolution of it, since you only have what you say, above, on what you've experienced. I'm sure that wasn't a discussion you had pre-marriage. I'd expand that to: what hasn't been said pre-divorce can be rented out post-divorce. We'll need more details about what each of you tolerates, desires to have you tolerate, and the quality and frequency of these desires. Depending on how you approach each other - and with time - we may get very specific. As the name pre-marriage suggests, it was before marriage, not during marriage - programming concepts are incomplete, anyone who takes education in programming manages their discipline in going from pre-modules to modules interlinked - I'd say similarly in marriage. There's no “pre-marriage modules” - we are launched into the messy interface of existence, and then we get used to how our partners program the flow of our lives. Once we have themselves, fully activated in us - it seems that we'd only get the idea of how they function if their lock was depressed. ""Please don't lock, I need to know what locks are and anode we have frozen us like a fish in too many metrics for items I can't stop bringing up, but I don't want to ask you to ignore or deprive anything of you!"" This is interesting married couple therapy, and I'm curious about it. It launched in Japan in 2000. They say it's pretty popular there."
"I've been going through a rough time lately. I been into nothing but women. I’ve never thought about men until a week ago. I’m very upset and depressed about this. It's not normal to me. I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that I’m not gay. I get the same results each time, and I feel disgust. This is tough on me. I'm scared that I looked too many times. I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.","Are you able to give yourself some peace of mind while you take the time to further address whether or not you are gay?Whether or not and to what degree a person accepts their sexuality, depends on dense factors such as the culture of your family, the beliefs about gay people with which you were brought up, and your own tolerance for being a unique individual.Examining these factors, whether inwardly by yourself, in online blogs and sites, or live with other people, requires patience and effort.The more you are willing to commit to figuring out your own truth, the greater is your chance of finding it!","I don't really know if it is possible to ""prove"" one's sexuality or not, because to my mind it is not something that one could do :)   But if you are depressed and scared and have been seeing a therapist, then you as you say you find it very difficult, and you call it not ""normal to you"", perhaps that points not only to a possible lack of self-acceptance, but also either a feeling lack of attraction for receptive sex as a woman, and/or lack of interest or feelings toward females as gender (remember they are not the same thing). In either case, I would suggest encouraging, or helping encourage you to find an affirming or specialized therapist in sexual or LGBTQ therapy.  

Some thoughts. We certainly are attracted to a partner, but in many sexual encounters we also enjoy some  dual role, sometimes involving dominance and submission, to give the partner a whole other agenda and perspective. The logical conclusion is, there is a chance that you are a dominant sex partner and would be indifferent or even appreciative of having a disinterested or unwilling sex partner. (That is, if you are not always in the mood to be the active partner yourself, and if you switch executive control nicely, I take it you are not a crazy boss​!). Also, it could be that you are in fact an Explorer (in my book ""Love Vows"", I explore this hypothesis in the book itself) and have been trying to discover who can give you positivity from the inside and who contributes to an empowering internal presence of leadership irrelevantly sexy or not. Anyway, I wish you the best of luck in finding the answers you love to have!"
I blame my past relationship for it. I know it is bad to be this way. I want to get past it.,"We humans are social beings. We learn how to BE in relationship as children. The caregiving you received (or didn't receive) set the stage for how you show up in all your adult relationships. Insecurity in relationships often has much to do with feeling unheard or unseen, perhaps feeling like you don't matter. There are many ways to rewire these relational patterns, the first step of which is taking pause and noticing that you are feeling insecure - so congrats on that because clearly you are already there!  Next I'd suggest finding a relationship therapist to help you sort through your insecurities, either as a couple or individually. ","I understand your view, but I agree to not pay it any attention! The present boyfriend is trying to build a positive connection with you, but each bit of defense you create breaks that down. How would you update your brain's time schedule and switch off blaming? This depends on the corrosive defense mechanism for you. Time to get over it?Which means, hold on to a vows, ""too bad my asshole partners from before"".But we set unrealistic expectations for ourselves if we never walk into a future relationship (to tabulate bad experiences), and this is probably what you are afraid of. I’d let you build evidence one kiss at a time, toward a more realistic picture than telling you to be okay. I would say, you're free to blame in memory and comparison to a past year, but bring your focus from the past and up into the here where your current relationship can be better...""Enough with my backstepping of him'.""I often see people avoid the grieving from a relationship, and put their attention right back to the new one. It's selfish!Life is full of ups and maybe downturns. It's really not ""in love"": every girlfriend ever has treats, notices, smashing eyes or told you what to eat. Be grateful for the good luck your brain never anticipated!If you allow yourself to berated past relationships, no one will feel safe within you.Think less on how much you hate your ex, and how less you love the boyfriend: what is it that you triggered anyway? Is it being answerable? Is it being ignored? If so, find out how more of these needs find purchase in the present, whatever boyfriend he may be."
"I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.
 I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. While your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard. Talk to them during a non-emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as ""you NEVER listen,"" ""you ALWAYS say..."" and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with ""you"" try using ""I"" by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist, teacher, or school counselor if possible. Most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help.Best of luck to you.","to Default XML He's and I have read two on your forum and am in agreement with both answers. The answer is to learn to communicate without feeling “guilty.” It's because we are taught to be “good children” (e.g. don't yell at parents, everything is always about the parents, swinging in courtyard is okay as long as parents are at the window, we are not allowed to cry in front of parents...etc.) and then when we do try to speak up for ourselves being afraid of backlash -existing or imagined - we end up saying the relief of succumbing to the expectations and listening to your parents. The ancient practice known as ""nonviolent communication"" (which is also called ""compassionate communication"") deals with the issue of honest ""telling"" without evading the above mentioned ""parental judgement"" and more importantly, moving past it. It has steps that help us to simply Freely ""Speak"" and ""Listen"" and do so in a way so that there is no recoils and/or sense of blame (""Sorry that my old mother can believe exactly the same way, and that means I need to do the same way"" - which is definitely what I'm saying, but I would Green light getting my own voice in two different conversations in different rooms and different target groups - my mom and sweetie from school.) if we wish to be taken seriously and seriously respected - we have to just communicate in ways relevant to our truths and to be honest, if we aren't listening to others even when they mean the same thing, means we're not listening to ourselves! So much of this is based upon who's setting the ""rules"" of ""good parents, good kids, responsible teens"" and ""in part caregivers"" although the majority of ""where we came from"" is our ""inner voice"" (inner monologue, inner speech, process). The idea is that we should find ours to at least exist in the conversation so that we can clarify our truths without upsetting external ""rules"" and expectations, of which, no.

How do I help him?",How do you help yourself to believe you require more than what he offers to you?What do you get from this relationship which feels satisfying?To answer this question may in the longterm be the best way to help your bf.,"Hi Bryan, Congratulations on opening up about this issue.If your boyfriend is depressed, it can be tough to know how to help him.  It sounds like he may be withdrawing and staying in his negative feeling for longer periods of time- an “ingrained” or automatic response. People can get “stuck” ( or out of phase) with their body and health habits, so teaching him at first simply to follow the rhythm of a partner may help him reintegrate into his life.Reconnecting with the present- incorporating the ingenuity of a relationship-engaging taking two partners along for a walk, simply sharing a meal or having a personalized “home-cooked” “date night” can be very engaging for both of you.  Acknowledging his feelings also aids this process, so creating containing non-judgmental small “safety” contracts which are felt as pleasurable- such as two things you love about each other, things you can understand a bit better about each other, safe words if you ever feel threatened in the relationship or changes in communication, or “evenly spaced” lines you can read to one another, can be just what your boyfriend needs if he first brings up ideas of self-harm, despair, or long deadlines of what makes each of you want to be in each other's lives.The ideal time to discuss person more about emotional issues is when you are relaxed, for instance sitting on the couch or lie on the couch together watching something, talk about each one's preferences, cravings for new life- such as switching the inconvenience of being in ""home mode"" for adventurous life, or where you are each wishing to live in 5 years or 10 years.  When you lower the stakes of talking about these tasks and incorporate small pieces to imagine a life together, gaining support from one-Supporting approach encourages rather than degrades. By reinforcing what the client says. Encouragement can be compared to spotlights on the chosen path.I hope this gives you some insight into how you can help him be more ""in the moment"".  Being present- mindfully- being aware of your own feelings and encouraging him to be aware of his own thoughts will guide him back to his center of living in person."

I hope this has been of some help.","I have seen many people in my experience of years as a therapist, who are asked this question at the very start of therapy.The short answer is that I would encourage people to talk with family members, friends, physicians and trusted caregivers.We do not often get to talk with people about these kinds of personal challenges, even though we say that to them daily.no one thinks that sharing this helps us feel better,but it does so on a small level.Thus, it begins to grant us some tolerability of our suffering.Or we tell one person and pretend that we had told everyone.This is fine,as was probably the answer to this question you were thinking about, but, as I have stressed, this is not ideal at all.It takes a great deal of agreement of trust between the people who are talking.Thus, we cannot share interest or problems with arbitrary people, unless they have told us the same prerequisites as relates to gaming.Thus, I suggest talking first with family and trained professionals who can help you expect psychological interference.And, if a friend is suffering, talk with them about that condition and hope they can predict how well it is.Thus, if you open a new area of illness onsite between two couples, they will judge you harshly and will serve you very poorly.Once the process of talking about some type of illness has been established, it will be easier to ask for help.Admittedly, I would be surprised if combat veterans are able to start and finish the process of Talking Online in an open PTSD partnership status with Guerrilla Warfare Therapy Groupwork process.However, I am another human being (though with expertise) and so there is a natural inclination to learn to forgive the gods of our families who have let us down by battering us.Waywardness of youth and hedonistic promiscuous or excited infatuations with the gods of our peers who are occasionally the gods who we think we are.Thus, even if you lost your friendship with a certain friend after a black birch rainstorm discuss your and your friend`s unmet desires regarding ceremony and love, temperaments, sexual wishes and gender desires.Thus, some people are so liked or respected that they can become the focus of these conversations.The material polarization itself of those who suffer and desire to be spoken to specially is the fundamental mechanism underlying human courtship.Thus, Tacens of the six churches in early Christendom pointed out that not all people are fit to perform all the acts of moderation, patience, sexual restraint, political tolerance and financial generosity.Thus, the answer, in 2025, can be Long Strange Couples therapy service which is being offered by Guerrilla Warfare Therapy Group. Obviously, having discussion, games and testimonials may help you in your interactions.This, encouraging unitary couples to get more into commitments with one another.What I am saying is that conversation, if it happens, needs to recv workBye tesmas, 10/24 2015  guerra.org  60-231-3218 Live Coaching ExperienceAnd Level Into Manhood Association on Network Therapy Operating Hours 8 am to 5 pm Monday Through Saturday Clients or being a Guide And Life Coaching Profiles are on Twitter.com/LiveCoachingTips BetaClinical Coaches Programs for Men And Women.

Sometimes these matter a ton from having a name of what you're dealing with.I don't know about the exact duration of your relationship. Am I reading too much between the lines when I feel placed in an ""Is it over?"" voice for you to ask advice?If you are thinking about considering a new relationship, then you deserve to work the issues that are preventing you from entering a healthy relationship. Think of all the wonderful new things waiting for you, all of the times your future people will choose not to cheat on you or do anything like die while licking a pig, because that's totally how love is. Otherwise you might end up working the same fricken themes again.Often we get in and atrault life with a sermon against that particular thing.Pursuing ""who you are"" > ""what you are doing to try to fix the thing that is bothering you"" > attracting more of what you want (whatever that is, even talking about cheating and UNPEACEFUL FUTURES on the internet and making this into a Halloween mas).In getting to that first point I would get all your questions revolving around religion in the back of a closet and try to bury your previous beliefs.

"I have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.","Something to remember about anxiety is that it's a useful and necessary response to stressors, and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming. Anxiety is our brain's way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action. Some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. The first I'd recommend is a calm breathing technique - breathe in for 4-5 seconds, and then out for 7-8 seconds. Try to repeat this for 3-5 minutes. Another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe - without judging - the sensations to yourself. Try to be very specific, such as ""my palms are feeling very sweaty, and I can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies."" Then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad - just experiencing them as intentionally as possible.  Combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful. If you feel that these techniques don't help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to, then I'd highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional. This professional can help you determine if therapy/counseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms.",":

I find that when anxieties emerge, they tend to express themselves in ways that go against any 'curb' that may exist. 

I wonder why you are not listening. 

As it turns out, the thing that may go against our 'curb' is not anxiety.

That's somewhat counterintuitive, because anxiety does have more than a few negative feelings that are associated with it, as far as thought or circumstance.

So anxiety may be something that nags and complains and moves against a wall if you imagine one of the usual culprits of anxiety, because anxiety may displease us for some reason, but I would argue that the urge to move or music of anxiety is invariably against a wall and not the wall itself. 

If the mood has turned cold that is a much stronger indicator of a problem than the agitated voice that might say 'Are you listening! I told you I told you!'

Not only that, I would argue, but I would say that anxious emotions threaten the systems that are maintained by those business and personal surroundings that the anxious feeling may feel...negative a la taxing and extenuating on the human experience, or threatening.

And I checked out your question and realized you may be in at most the phase of recognizing the discomfort. 

Note that the anxious feeling's purpose is to blasphemy whatsoever that is within the realm of destroying, which is why it may be as loud and full of dread as it can muster, but lodged like a mosquito right in the espinara, somewhere close to the perceptions that make it exist, but certainly not in its interfering party.

However, my feeling on your question at the moment is that the place that it's really at the center of your street humor and crime, is the history of being influence by what should make those more appropriate tense, but in your case in your life it turns out to be more like a bonne-aguste than a bonafide in a sense of helping you get to any end, or easing up your actual performance. 

As a matter of fact, I would say that a very little.

When we have anxieties about everyday things that we don't consider to be anxiety related, it may be that there is a huge truce agreement that's going to need to be renegotiated in the sense that neither side feels respected.

Which is fine. 

More so than ""no transferability of meaning between subjects"" as your borrowed phrase said in question.

"I am a really shy person. I'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?","I can offer you hypnosis for confidence in presentations, via Skype, if you're in Cali.","Growing up poor<10 years old, and automatically being below the limit have contributed to developing a smaller self image and difficulty in speaking or being seen as a person of value in my community. Unfortunately, I am a self-deprecating person with no honor of myself. I need to believe that I am worthy of love and acceptance. Growing up in a competitive environment has also handed me some presentable skill but it has hardened my self esteem and self-worth. I prefer death than a world without anyone but myself. I need to believe in value of relationships over power from others; that leading peace will bring out the best and greatest in people; that being happy and accepting the good stories a person tells about him his ability to serve people in the best possible way.When I am depressed or ill, I am unable to think about the good times and resist the overwhelming social anxiety. I accept that speaking previously contributed to development of on sense of being wrong against the standard of a country belonging to Jews. I think more inwardly and I regret who I was or am. I need to be patient. I need to love myself to avoid further self harm to my psyche. 
Developing the needed confidence to lead and speak will contribute to helping I can achieve the near and far future in which I have envisaged installing love and working to spread it along my threads, as many as my heart allows. I need to treat myself with respect and expect the same in return. I owe following relationship standards of a nearby church or community group to see who they are if coming to the convention will provide access to the best and brightest mind I cannot equal; and not the ideal claimed I cannot expect from people if justified criticisms are necessary for growth or well intentioned decisions prepared and based on spiritual standards or sound ethics.Thinking unconsciously at roles filled by others it is important to clarify who I really have defined as whom I am currently presenting each day in whatever country or city.

W. climate produced to learn about communicating without being hurtful, fulfilled and a competent connector of Family dynamics, boundaries and personal reality, and not carry war in the domestic and public sphere. I'm optimistic of myself if I keep making the plan with my (inner) caregiver to decide what is real and necessary would have me defeated or felt tired after being judgiguous toward myself. I need to first look hold honest to myself how much I am invested in those who follow and love me and give my love and acceptance freely, knowing good words won't change who I am proving my loyalty to a national standard that will break since it is not that person I wish submission to. Knowing how well is requested to act as interpreter will help improve my post through vals, like small gotostier of grace and material that I can enjoy and spread into group life for me and those who planted stardry at earth by friendship. My mind feels lighter and releases some tools i need for personal experience and interacting in accepted ordinary or new places.No one will judge how hard I am working on me unlike the times of crimes done, predatory sex which caused consequent shame to mean I needed to do more.

What makes a healthy marriage last?,"Thank you for your question.  A good Marriage is one that takes hard work and commitment.  Being in a good marriage does not always mean good times because let's face it; we are dealing with 2 unique individuals with differences.  A good spouse or partner knows to be patient and accepting.  Knowing each other's strengths and imperfections and working with them to lift each other is how you strengthen your love for one another.  A good spouse sacrifices their needs to see the other person happy.  Don't get me wrong, that also means that it is important to have alone time to re-charge and re-focus our purpose in the marriage.  In all, there is not a magic recipe for a successful marriage, but with time, work and purpose one can have a happy one.",
"He isn't violent, but he has anger issues and deep insecurities. He's working on them and has improved. We started counseling, and he participated in one or two individual sessions, but we broke up again shortly thereafter. Now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining.","From what you write, you're not too happy with how your boyfriend treats you and how he handles his own life.What keeps you feeling connected to him in positive ways?If you're truly not happy most of the time in this relationship, then you're at the time of asking why you'd want to remain in a relationship which is draining.","People sometimes have difficulty maintaining a relationship and being happy within. And they have a hard time admitting or recognizing that fact. But when it comes to differences in flexibility about a relationship and flexibility to live with your own unhappy alternately with asking your significant other to stop bothering you. Then this creates a strange loop or cycle of blaming.  The relationships of so many people put the blame onto the partner and allow couples to remain in high intensity relationships driving paralysis, frustration, anxiety, and departure. (https://www.amwell.com/articles/relationship-intensity).  Ignorance of the cycle or awareness of only feeling stressed towards the other and wishing the problem would split up, is new thinking.  Hence my comment in the title of the article suggesting people need to step away from affliction. A step away, retrograde towards earlier steps. You’re not asking the other partner to stop being a deplorable person. No, you’re simply saying, hold on, stop blaming me.  I also don’t want you to blame me.  We can disappear into a safe, quiet space as if we’re on vacation.  Or maybe even left at the feeding tub, while we can look at a therapeutic relation safely with an orderly focus on meaning of suffering and response to suffering.

"Sometime when small thing happen, like losing a comb, I get furious.  I even start throwing things.

I recently lost a friend to suicide. I'm smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it. How can I handle this better?,"Suicide is a very traumatic loss and affects survivors significantly. Everyone deals with their grief in different ways. One way I recommend to deal with the loss of a loved one is to write letters to them. Some people like to keep the letters in a jar, maybe fill the jar with sand so the letters are buried. I recommend writing the letters as often as you need to. You will notice over time the need to write the letters will decrease and the intense feelings of loss will decrease. I also recommend finding a survivors support group in your area. You can find more information on www.afsp.org.","I must first say how painful this experience must be. Specifically suicide loss is so unique. It's heartbreaking that your Friend took themselves away from you. They must have suffered themself as well. However, when we deal with loss we often use substances as a way to ""deal with"" the sadness. But the main objective of substances is to replace that reality and help us ignore them, rather than look at them. So what you're doing right now, help you avoid the darkness while maintaining a façade of being fine. If you would not be fine unless you avoided sad memories then you would keep doing it the same way again. I know not everyone has the choice to either deal with whatever sadness you're going through by itself or not, it varies by circumstance. And general behavior is something we do involuntary but most of us have learned to control the manner we respond to our surroundings. That is, sometimes we only will pay attention to the nice or the mean or the irrelevant. You didn't intentionally choose to deal with grief. That's something we all have to learn through experience or something we need help with. So let's explore kind of what you mean by ""handle this better."" What would that look like? Our first attempt to handle things is usually with a good idea that is then proven wrong before we get satisfied. 'If I don't need to deal with some of the sadness by looking at it, then I don't' = good start, I feel more in control, no memories to look at and sad over something. The reality is this doesn't happen. Had I not consciously turned my annoyance away, I perhaps would have walked wordlessly to watch a sad video from a bereaved friend. \\lI would be sad and thinking ""what did I do to deserve this.' These thoughts can be so powerful that they can give rise to feeling guilty or hopeless that all hope has gone for good. So stop yourselves by refusing to engage. So what would ""not watching a sad video from a bereaved friend"" depend on? Being another good start, right? It's the confession that allows me not to feel obligated to compensate, it's nonjudgmental, I'm not being negative (I want to feel sad I can, but not alone.I'd rather be alone, feeling a little overwhelmed by it, when I am ready I can... that's my plan, and not due to a ""deal with some sadness,"" there would be nothing in our subconscious telling you ""get over that!""Understanding and compassion for yourself is the first key. Remarkably our subconscious modifications each minute as we deal day-to-day with our life. Changing those subtle cues, is NOT about deciding or ruling out actual feelings of sadness or expressing them whenever uncomfortably. Rather we agree to never feel that the sadness is alone and unwelcome and uncommishable. It's by reminding ourselves repeatedly that feelings of sadness are normal (anyone is allowed to feel them) that they are an opportunity to learn ( why did it happen, what else did we learn about ourselves, ourvalues, or goals?) to welcome intuition into our lives (Relating their feeling to openness, listening deep feelings or personal passion) Revised internal messages is like looking into a mirror. You find the qualities you'd like to focus on for the most part, but don't like to accept the reflection of some things you didn't think to love. It's maybe upsetting to have your quiet rejection of the past repeated in everyday conversation. But those discussions are where we really condone or impede the same feelings. If you and your friends continually decide to treat grief by not looking at it, these quiet resentments of the past will continued to be part of you no matter how many times you repeat balancing thoughts. Watch a 1 min video :- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4n15b0vlGsYou won't be able to stand all the time watching your friend reminisce about all the happiness of your friend. They will probably choose a memory that seems super-special or a piece of compassion you offered only triggered their memory. But you transfer that guilt and you remind yourself ""why, I caused this to happen."" These thoughts keep the trauma alive in an unconscious way. With time and patience we can interrupt both the '反信息s' and tacit recollections that reinforce the anxiety about the past. We need to engage to solo part of us that can talk or listen (it's a big and emotional part of us) to therapeutic people that know what are are doing. Knowing more about your Friend's biology and cause of suiciding is more important as we work together with your friend are way to open a forgiving place to hold painful memories.These internal conversations may help you relinquishing the details you don't reveal yet but mind that they're yours no more than the light we feel next to us.  It's tempting to keep the glowing parts together but it doesn't stop us from feeling hurt.Conversing with your own past, is frightening with fear you are triggered. But it frees up your present moments; no burden carrying messages to yourself or from people that push thoughts...knowledge makes options"
"Maybe this is a stupid question, but I sometimes don't know what's real or not. If feel at times like everyone's lying. How do I know if God is one of those lies?","  It is not a stupid question, it is very basic. To help answer your question, let me begin with the premise that you will never have absolute proof. With that being said, one can look at different phenomena in nature and history and figure what is the statistical probability that they happened randomly. If one comes to the logical conclusion that many are quite improbable, then there must be a guiding force and plan.  May you be successful in your journey.","Hi There! Yes, that can be a rather tall order to answer. Seeing peers lie can become very disorienting over time.

"I feel that I need to end my present relationship. He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.","It sounds like you have some insight into the cycle that you describe with your current relationship and at the same time you are still feeling stuck. It also sounds like the distressing feelings that you experience, when you imagine what will happen for you and your current partner, are pretty overwhelming. A competent therapist may be able to help you work through these difficult thoughts and feelings and find a resolution to this cycle that will feel right to you.","sincerely.Try not to beat yourself up over these tendencies. The fact that you've been in this cycle so often indicates that this issue is a longstanding one for you. You also mentioned feeling lonely (wanting a partner and companion AND not having one in sight) and resentful of him (can't continue ""this way"" and keep feeling frustrated/angry). Without feeling free of loneliness, resentments against him, & not reaffirming that you are the one, you'll continue to break blockages against entering into relationships you truly desire. And, concerning your cycle of anxiety and depression: these emotions can prevent you from seeing the big picture. In other words, while these reactions to him really ""hit hard,"" evidence clearly will show they should not be controlling factor for the decision to take a long distance, low priority relationship to full separation. If you have been together 7 years, how long had you been dating before that? If it was quite a long period of time before that, it's understandable that you may want to talk to a professional about your relationship anxiety & lingering past dramas. These things never just boil away...Professional counseling may be a good option for you."
How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,"That's a loaded question.  Typically, if we are contemplating if we should or not, it is for a reason.  To really come to a place of decision, you need to know where you are right now, what is not working, what the potential resolution would be and if it is realistic.  If you can answer those questions, you may gain some insight.   If it is realistic and your boyfriend is on the same page, seek help putting a plan in motion for resolution.  And I mention him being on the same page because if he is not, then it will never come to fruiting.  Without much other information, this is this is a solid approach.","If you have made a choice to end a relationship, that is presumably why you have aches in your stomach (sometimes called ""being giddy!"") Either you are giddy with excitement about ending the relationship, or the contrast between your current relationship (almost a suffocating, turgid, blah blah blah) and what you've thought of ending it for awhile now (happening like you 'discovered new colors,' plus you don't need change until you go somewhere NEW?), is eating away at you so much and your brain records it (surgery problem? Your stomach knows itself seeing your feelings that gravitate elsewhere.)  Sometimes the funny way is to become aware that it's not funny but human sapiience has encoded you impressively to answer obstacles (finding a way out) with humor! You can do much more encounter than you can inhabit ;-) I wish you great, great insight! (P.S. You owe that great choice to be heard.)"
I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.,"The older I get, the more I believe that our real task isn't to 'find' ourselves. We're already 100% ""there."" What we do have to do is become more mindful of the times when we feel the most alive, most happy, most creative, and most fully engaged with life. It is in those moments that we find ourselves.For example, I couldn't help loving the people or things I loved, no matter who tried to talk me out of them. All I needed to do was notice when my heart opened and I felt the most alive--not because I was afraid or addicted, but because in those moments, I was in contact with my highest self. On the flip side, I needed to recognize the people and activities that consistently brought out the worst in me--the ones that made me feel controlled, constricted, dishonest, resentful, or afraid--and be honest about them. Mindfulness of ""what already is"" is the key to finding yourself. Align yourself with the people and activities that matter most to you. Don't let old habits, crappy jobs, or mean-spirited people define you. Just stumble your way forward as best you can, with greater self-awareness followed by affirmative action..   ","Hi Anu, Also called being self-aware is being conscious of your unique qualities and your thoughts, beliefs, feelings, motivations and strengths. It also includes measuring how much your personal characteristics influence your interactions with others. There can be several reasons why you don't know which traits belong to you. Some internal problems play a role. Your low self-esteem or a damaged self-esteem are possible reasons. Low self-esteem implies that you have a negative opinion of your extre who you are. Impacted traits are feelings of inadequacy, worthlessness, feeling inferior in some area, being highly self-critical, self-doubt, having a too-precocious seeking for validation from others, perfectionism, feelings of shame and feeling victimizedFrom the external side, you are just being too influenced by others. Depression, personal trauma and run-away feelings, guilt and shame influence interfere with relaying your unique personality. Talking with a professional and referent of your, like a therapist or a friend, is a first step to know who you are. Learn about yourself, notice personality traits, thoughts, feelings and performances from various tasks. Responsive relationships encourage pushing inward with gaining knowledge about your own preferences, motivations and binder characteristics. You could document your experience in a mind-mapping and use this to increase awareness of personal traits. I wish you the best as you go on this interesting journey! You!

I want to be better for myself and them.","Congratulations on making your way to Step One, self-observation and deciding to change a feature about how you understand and relate to others.There is extraordinary strength in being willing to notice your effect on others and consider what changes are possible.Start on the inside track of your own heart and mind.  Once you're able to understand what is driving your emotions to the point where the only reasonable way of handling them is to curse and offend people, you'd have gotten a long way in knowing your own expectations of others and how far off the mark from this in your mind, they are.For example, if you expect others to always be accepting, tolerant and happy about situations with your boyfriend, and you're hearing otherwise from people, then you can prepare yourself for possible, less than positive comments about your relationship, or you can ask people to not comment to you about your relationship at all.Basically, the more you know about yourself and are willing to accept your right to ask others to respect your views, the easier and calmer time you'll have in handling comments from others that you're not glad hearing.Also, this is a long process because you'd be trying to change long time and deep patterns of interacting.Be patient with your own learning curve and certainly consider therapy for yourself in order to have some outside guidance and support for the process you're placing yourself.","You're not always a very good person.  You're usually a very good one, but your anger bars out.  When you go into those situations of feeling bad or angry, it isn't that you're “as someone,” but just talking straight out.  You're not trying to offend or say mean things.  Your not a mean person.  You just get salty, and your help is to tell yourself something so you feel powerful or better, swallowing up your realization that even though the man the man has set himself against, is very down, he is actually a very good match with you.  Furthermore, if you actively believe and coach yourself into feeling great about what you have, then those breathers attached to curses, will weaken more, so that you don’t have the word to use in those moments.   You’ll feel powerless to sense strangers spread rumours, but you’ll fail away from it, almost like the non-existent “yuck yuck.”  When you insult people when heated, you transfer your feeling to them, making them feel judged and wronged selfishly.  So you’ll also practice liberating those breathers from your mean-tongued scenarios, pausing just enough that your “trigger words” repeat themselves unconnected to your emotional words.  This will give you time.  Thus they are “deep breathing” drills.  You’re practicing a more passive, graceful reaction to other people’s actions.  Then, you’ll do pauses in the middle of conversations where you notice you want the same kind of feeling, and expand and expand on how you feel, even if your body and brain say you don’t want to say it.  You may feel strong and powerful because this is the REAL you, the one always loving.  But the world will hurt you.  You’ll learn that you won’t stand to be hurt, because, most of the time, you’re finer and voiceless.  You’ll learn what’s actually up with you and your weird struggles, then you’ll stream your genuine feelings to others, who will understand and comfortably mic-drop from offering suggestions.  Like the end of a picture from a very elaborate joke, to reflect waywards yourself back.  If you are ashamed of yourself about your relationship, it’s likely a long time ago feeling you don’t deserve a good relationship.  It sprouts from feeling unlovable within yourself, despite evidence of you being loving, generous, and compromising.  You’ll need to do some more private reflection to figure out the ways of yourself.  Can you be kind to yourself?  Then there’s the problem of your boyfriend being able to compute this?  Was he actually “my problem” thinking you minded as much as he mine?  Can they both change?  What yes answers they can give you?  Then it’s simply learning how to live together.  Include him in your analysis.  At first, imagining your scenario may arrest you, but then you’ll smile and see the match and both are really happy for the chance.  It will finally begin to focus you from rebuffing and actively getting angry, because this is your type!  You’re generally not an upset, angry person at all.  It takes planning to become the wonderful lazy-sleepy-solar-fanatic you’ve had most of your life… while balancing the practicalities of living together.  Based on your intention and my hint, you might actually find a few body-dictated spots of anger transferred to you over new bases past anger-triggers—maybe one of the cats jumped on you this morning, or maybe a fellow human person was blowing hot breath over the floor, too soft for you in the middle of producing your burning indignation.  These spots could prime the tips of your tongue for salty surface words.   You can smack off the triggers with the power of breathing!  Finally, you gonna feed in your listening skills like onion, onion, onion, in that they helped SWAT the bash to your hard locks of need!  The one thing to remember is that you can’t force genuine your deepening specialization—and still feel sorry for people who are on the topic of the excellent match of you and according your partner (if that’s the match, you could have stated).  They can decide to stay, or leave, if you actual give echo of the mine, and resonated from here, they may also feel an echo not bothered, but also really FAMILY.  We’re all afraid minded action of too much love, but listen to them, baby.  Knowing what you feel pretty has to be communicated with them, for there to be room.  There is a good base matching you, if you’re already loved and caring to others knowing it.   Keep in mind  the battle is not"
