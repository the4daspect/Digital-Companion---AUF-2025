I am so sorry that you are having to go through this. I am sure that it is difficult. I have to say that I am not a huge fan of long distance relationships, but I do understand that sometimes they are necessary. I would say that you need to be honest with him about your feelings and concerns. I would also encourage you to be honest with yourself about your feelings. I think it is important to ask yourself if you are okay with the fact that you are going to be far away from each other and to make sure that you are okay with that. I would also encourage you to set a time limit. I would say that if you are not able to see each other in person for a certain amount of time, then you need to re-evaluate the relationship. You need to make sure that you are both on the same page and that you are both willing to do what it takes to make it work. I would also encourage you to be honest with yourself about your feelings.

This is a very serious problem and I strongly recommend that you seek help from a local mental health professional. Self-harm is a very serious issue and can lead to permanent injury or death. The problem is that the person who self-harms is usually trying to cope with some other issue that is causing them great distress. The self-harm is a way of coping with that distress. It is usually a temporary way of coping, because the distress usually returns and the person then uses self-harm again. The only way to really address this problem is to find out what is causing the distress and to learn other ways of coping with it. You are already on the right track by seeking help. A mental health professional can help you to learn other ways of coping with distressing situations and to understand why you feel the need to self-harm. I wish you the best. Robin J.

       " RequestOutput(request_id=22, prompt=\"<|im_start|>user\\nMy husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board—no more drinking every night.\\n The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.  I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. I just feel like I'm so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty.

I am sorry to hear about your panic attacks and trouble sleeping. It is hard to know for sure what is causing these symptoms, but I will try to give you some ideas. First, let me say that I am not a medical doctor, so I cannot diagnose anything. I would recommend seeing a medical doctor or a psychiatrist for a medical evaluation. Sometimes, medical problems can cause anxiety or trouble sleeping. Also, many medications can cause anxiety or trouble sleeping. If there is nothing medically wrong, then we can look at other causes.\\xa0Panic attacks are a symptom of anxiety. There are many things that can cause anxiety, and they are different for everyone. Some things that can cause anxiety are: stress, trauma, genetics, and medical conditions. There are also many things that can make anxiety worse. Things like caffeine, alcohol, drugs, and stress can make anxiety worse. So, if you are using drugs or alcohol or drinking a lot of caffeine or experiencing a lot of stress, these things can make your anxiety worse.\\xa0Now, as far as trouble sleeping, there are many things that can cause trouble sleeping. Things like stress, anxiety, medical conditions, medications, caffeine, alcohol, and drugs can all cause trouble sleeping. So, it is possible that the anxiety and trouble sleeping are related. If you are anxious, it is hard to sleep. If you don't sleep well, then it can make anxiety worse. It can become a cycle.\\xa0So, I would recommend seeing a medical doctor or psychiatrist for a medical evaluation. If there is nothing medically wrong, then you may want to see a counselor or therapist to help you deal with any stress or trauma that may be causing the anxiety. There are also medications that can help with anxiety and trouble sleeping.\\xa0I hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J.

This sounds like a very difficult problem to have. There are a number of things that could be going on here. One possibility is that you are experiencing some kind of anxiety that is causing the nightmares and sleeplessness. Anxiety can also cause you to wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble getting back to sleep. Another possibility is that you are experiencing trauma or some kind of stressor that is causing these dreams and problems with sleep. It is important to know that the dreams you are having are a normal response to trauma. If you have been through a traumatic event, having nightmares is very common. I would encourage you to see a counselor or a doctor to help you with this. There are medications that can help you sleep and there are some counseling techniques that can help you work through your dreams and any other problems you may be having. I hope this helps.

You are asking some really great questions, and it\\'s hard to give you a simple answer. Let me start with this: There is no such thing as the \"perfect guy.\" There are good guys, and there are guys who are a good match for you. I am not sure if you are in love with your current boyfriend or not. I would say that you are attracted to him and you like him, but I am not sure if you are in love with him. You say that you want to marry someone you can wake up to and fall in love with all over again. That\\'s a good thing to want. If you are in love, you will wake up to him every day and fall in love all over again. If you are not in love, you may wake up and feel okay about it, but you won\\'t fall in love. That is not to say that you won\\'t be happy with him. You may very well be. I have been in relationships where I liked the person a lot, but I wasn\\'t in love with them. I was happy with them, but I was also looking for someone I was in love with. I found that person, and now I am in love.\\xa0So, my question for you is this: What is it that you are looking for? Are you looking for someone who you are in love with, or are you looking for someone who you can be happy with? I would say that you can be happy with someone you are not in love with, but you will not be happy with someone you are in love with if they are not in love with you. I don\\'t know how long you have been in this relationship, but I would say that if you have been together for a while and you still aren\\'t in love with him, then you may never be. I would suggest that you look at your reasons for being in the relationship. Are you in it because you are in love with him, or are you in it because you like him and you are afraid to be alone? Are you in it because you are afraid of being single, or are you in it because you love him?\\xa0I would suggest that you do some self-exploration. You can do this on your own, but it is often helpful to talk to someone about your feelings. If you want to talk to someone, you can talk to your friends, your family, or you can talk to a therapist. A therapist can help you to understand your feelings and help you to sort through your thoughts. If you decide that you want to be with your boyfriend, you can work on making that relationship better. If you decide that you are not in love with him, you may want to end it. If you decide that you are in love with him, then you can work on making it better.\\xa0I hope this was helpful. Be well. Robin J.

It\\'s hard to be in a relationship where you feel you can\\'t talk about things, or where your partner uses the threat of leaving to get his way. It\\'s not okay for him to do that. I can see that you want to work things out, and I think you should. You and your partner are in a position where you have kids together, and that\\'s a really good reason to work on your relationship. I\\'d like to offer a few thoughts, and then I\\'ll offer a few questions for you to consider.\\xa0Firstly, it\\'s important to remember that you can\\'t control your partner\\'s actions. You can only control your own. You can\\'t make him stop saying hurtful things, or make him stop dwelling on issues. You can only make a choice to walk away from that behaviour and not engage with it. It\\'s okay to say, \"I don\\'t want to talk to you right now. I\\'ll talk to you in a few hours (or days) when you are ready to talk to me respectfully.\" And then walk away. It\\'s okay to protect yourself and your children from hurtful behaviour.\\xa0Secondly, it\\'s okay to have different styles of communicating. You say you\\'re \"all about resolving the problem\" and he \"dwells on the issue\". It\\'s possible you have a different style of communicating. Maybe you\\'d like to resolve the issue right away and move on, and he needs some time to process his feelings. Maybe he needs some time to process, and then he\\'s ready to talk about it. This doesn\\'t mean he\\'s not willing to work things out, it just means he needs some time to process.\\xa0Thirdly, I\\'m wondering if you\\'re swallowing your pride because you\\'re afraid of the consequences of not swallowing your pride. If you\\'re afraid of being alone or of not having a family, that\\'s a good reason to swallow your pride. But if you\\'re swallowing your pride because you\\'re afraid of being yelled at or being told hurtful things, then it\\'s not okay. You deserve to be treated with respect.\\xa0Now, here are a few questions for you to consider:\\xa01. What are your needs in this relationship? What do you need from him in order to feel happy and fulfilled?\\xa02. What are your non-negotiables? What behaviours are you not willing to tolerate?\\xa03. What are his needs? What does he need from you?\\xa04. What are his non-negotiables?\\xa05. How do you want your children to see you and your relationship? What kind of example do you want to set for them?\\xa0I hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J.

It can be helpful to learn how to manage anxiety in general and there are some great books on this topic. If you are interested in a more specific approach, exposure therapy can be very helpful. In exposure therapy, you would learn some skills to help you manage your anxiety, and then gradually expose yourself to anxiety producing situations. This can be done in vivo (in real life) or in imagination. The idea is that you would slowly increase the level of anxiety producing situations until you are able to manage your anxiety and travel with ease. You could start by imagining yourself on the road and work your way up to actually traveling.

This is a very common question. Many people struggle with similar issues. You are not alone. The good news is that there is help. I will try to provide some thoughts here, but I do want to encourage you to seek out a counselor. This is something that a counselor can help you with.\\xa0First, I want to say that you have already taken a very important step by recognizing that you have a problem and that you want to change. That is a very important first step.\\xa0Now, let's talk about what might be going on. You are right that you seem to gravitate toward unavailable men. This is very common. Many of us do this. Why do we do this? It is because we have learned that this is what we can expect from others. It is what we have learned about ourselves. We have learned that we are not worthy of a good relationship. We have learned that we can't trust others. We have learned that we can't trust ourselves.\\xa0So, how do we change this? Well, the first step is to recognize that this is what is going on. You have done that. The second step is to recognize that you are not worthless, or unlovable, or untrustworthy. That is not true. You are a human being, and you are worthy of love and respect. The third step is to find a therapist who can help you work through all of this. It is hard to change these things on your own.

This is a tough situation, and I am not sure I can tell you what to do, but I can offer some thoughts. First, it sounds like you may be in a situation where you have to make a decision for yourself. This is not easy. It is often hard to make decisions when they affect other people. You may want to talk with your dad about this. You may want to tell him that you are feeling pressured to do track, and that you are not happy. You may want to tell him that you want to do track because you want to, not because you feel obligated. I think most parents would want their children to be happy.\\xa0The second thing I would think about is whether you are able to do track and still do the other sports. If you are able to do all of them, then maybe you can do that. If you are not able to, then you will have to make a decision about which ones you want to do. If you decide to stop doing track, then you may have to tell your coach and your teammates. I think most people would understand if you told them that you were not able to do track anymore. If you are not able to do all of the sports, then you will have to decide which ones you want to do. If you decide to stop doing track, then you may have to tell your coach and your teammates.

       " RequestOutput(request_id=69, prompt=\"<|im_start|>user\\nI have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and I just had my first kiss five months ago. I’m worried that, at this rate, I won’t have a boyfriend for a very long time. The problem is that I want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, I don't want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex. I have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. Luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. I feel dirty by doing this, but I feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people are surprised when they find out that I am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think I am really good looking. I am tall, I play lots of sports, and I get excellent grades in school. I am in my first year of university right now, and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest. It bothers me. Most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already.

Or, do you mean that you have asked them out and they said yes, but then you didn\\'t tell them about your cross-dressing and they found out and were bothered by it?\\xa0The answer to your question really depends on what you are asking. If you are asking if you should stop cross-dressing, I would say, \"No.\" I think it is important to be true to yourself. If you are happy doing it, then you should continue to do it. I am not sure if you are asking if you should tell your partner about it, or if you are asking if you should continue to date people who don\\'t want to be with you because of it. If you are asking if you should tell your partner about it, I would say, yes, you should. It is important to be open and honest with your partner. If you are asking if you should date someone who doesn\\'t want to be with you because of your cross-dressing, then I would say, no. You deserve to be with someone who loves you for who you are.\\xa0I think it is important to remember that everyone is different. Some people will be okay with your cross-dressing, and some people won\\'t. You cannot change who you are, but you can decide who you want to be with. I would say, don\\'t hold back. Be who you are. It may take a while to find the right person, but they are out there. Be patient, and don\\'t give up. I wish you the best of luck. Robin J.

The best way to learn to cope with triggers is to work with a therapist who has experience working with trauma. If you are not able to find a therapist, there are some things you can do on your own to help you cope with triggers. The first step is to be aware of your triggers. You may already be aware of some triggers. If not, you may notice that you have a reaction to something that is not necessarily related to what you are currently doing. For example, you may be feeling anxious when you are driving down the road, but you are not aware of what is causing the anxiety. If you are able to notice that something is triggering you, you may be able to identify what is causing the trigger. It could be something that you see, hear, smell, taste, or touch. Once you are aware of your triggers, you can start to work on coping with them. Some ways of coping with triggers are deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, yoga, and exercise. You can also try to distract yourself with something that you enjoy doing. Another way to cope with triggers is to have a self-soothing box. A self-soothing box is a box that contains items that help you to feel calm and relaxed. You can have anything in your box that you like. You may want to have music, pictures, a stuffed animal, or anything else that helps you to feel calm and relaxed. You can also try to use your senses to help you cope with triggers. You can try to focus on your senses by noticing what you see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. You can also try to use your senses to help you to feel calm and relaxed. For example, you can try to focus on the feeling of your feet on the ground or the feeling of your hands in your lap. You can also try to use your senses to help you to feel calm and relaxed by focusing on your breathing. You can try to focus on your breathing by noticing the rise and fall of your chest or the feeling of your breath in your nose.', token_ids=[151667, 271, 151668, 271, 3862, 525, 1657, 2155, 5510, 311, 36486, 448, 30754, 13, 576, 1850, 1616, 311, 3960, 311, 36486, 448, 30754, 374, 311, 975, 448, 264, 41763, 879, 702, 3139, 3238, 448, 29888, 13, 1416, 498, 525, 537, 2952, 311, 1477, 264, 41763, 11, 1052, 525, 1045, 2513, 498, 646, 653, 389, 697, 1828, 311, 1492, 498, 36486, 448, 30754, 13, 576, 1156, 3019, 374, 311, 387, 7853, 315, 697, 30754, 13, 1446, 1231, 2669, 387, 7853, 315, 1045, 30754, 13, 1416, 537, 11, 498, 1231, 5293, 429, 498, 614, 264, 12720, 311, 2494, 429, 374, 537, 14312, 5435, 311, 1128, 498, 525, 5023, 3730, 13, 1752, 3110, 11, 498, 1231, 387, 8266, 37000, 979, 498, 525, 9842, 1495, 279, 5636, 11, 714, 498, 525, 537, 7853, 315, 1128, 374, 14381, 279, 18056, 13, 1416, 498, 525, 2952, 311, 5293, 429, 2494, 374, 51505, 498, 11, 498, 1231, 387, 2952, 311, 10542, 1128, 374, 14381, 279, 8183, 13, 1084, 1410, 387, 2494, 429, 498, 1490, 11, 6723, 11, 22068, 11, 12656, 11, 476, 5796, 13, 9646, 498, 525, 7853, 315, 697, 30754, 11, 498, 646, 1191, 311, 975, 389, 61982, 448, 1105, 13, 4329, 5510, 315, 61982, 448, 30754, 525, 5538, 25938, 11, 22257, 15747, 42585, 11, 32762, 11, 26011, 11, 323, 10158, 13, 1446, 646, 1083, 1430, 311, 63817, 6133, 448, 2494, 429, 498, 4669, 3730, 13, 13293, 1616, 311, 36486, 448, 30754, 374, 311, 614, 264, 656, 33019, 78, 1596, 3745, 13, 362, 656, 33019, 78, 1596, 3745, 374, 264, 3745, 429, 5610, 3589, 429, 1492, 498, 311, 2666, 19300, 323, 30367, 13, 1446, 646, 614, 4113, 304, 697, 3745, 429, 498, 1075, 13, 1446, 1231, 1366, 311, 614, 4627, 11, 9185, 11, 264, 44313, 9864, 11, 476, 4113, 770, 429, 8609, 498, 311, 2666, 19300, 323, 30367, 13, 1446, 646, 1083, 1430, 311, 990, 697, 37107, 311, 1492, 498, 36486, 448, 30754, 13, 1446, 646, 1430, 311, 5244, 389, 697, 37107, 553, 61364, 1128, 498, 1490, 11, 6723, 11, 22068, 11, 12656, 11, 323, 5796, 13, 1446, 646, 1083, 1430, 311, 990, 697, 37107, 311, 1492, 498, 311, 2666, 19300, 323, 30367, 13, 1752, 3110, 11, 498, 646, 1430, 311, 5244, 389, 279, 8266, 315, 697, 7541, 389, 279, 4910, 476, 279, 8266, 315, 697, 6078, 304, 697, 23410, 13, 1446, 646, 1083, 1430, 311, 990, 697, 37107, 311, 1492, 498, 311, 2666, 19300, 323, 30367, 553, 21080, 389, 697, 25938, 13, 1446, 646, 1430, 311, 5244, 389, 697, 25938, 553, 61364, 279, 10000, 323, 4399, 315, 697, 15138, 476, 279, 8266, 315, 697, 11486, 304, 697, 19142, 13, 151645], cumulative_logprob=None, logprobs=None, finish_reason=stop, stop_reason=None)], finished=True, metrics=None, lora_request=None, num_cached_tokens=0, multi_modal_placeholders={}),\n",

Let\\'s look at both.\\xa0First, I want to say that it\\'s okay to lie to someone if it\\'s to protect yourself. I think you\\'re lying to protect yourself from his criticism, and that\\'s okay. It\\'s also okay to not trust someone who is criticizing you. I think you\\'re protecting yourself from being hurt.\\xa0But here\\'s the thing: If you want a relationship with someone who you can trust, who you can trust you, and who will treat you with respect, you have to start by doing that with yourself. You have to trust yourself enough to be honest, and you have to respect yourself enough to treat yourself with kindness and honesty. You can\\'t expect others to do that for you if you\\'re not doing it for yourself.\\xa0The good news is that you already know how to be kind and honest with yourself. You\\'re already doing it, in a way. You know that lying isn\\'t good for you. You know that criticizing yourself isn\\'t good for you. You know that you don\\'t like it when he treats you that way. You know that you want better for yourself. That\\'s a good start.\\xa0The next step is to start doing that for yourself. Start with little things. If you\\'re going to lie, start by lying to yourself less. Can you tell yourself the truth about the little things? Can you be honest with yourself about your feelings? Can you be kind to yourself when you make a mistake? Can you say \"I\\'m sorry\" to yourself? Can you be patient with yourself? Can you do small things that you know will make you feel better?\\xa0And then, when you\\'re ready, can you start doing that with him? Can you tell him the truth about the little things? Can you tell him how you feel? Can you ask him to be kind to you? Can you ask him to listen to you? Can you ask him to respect you?\\xa0It\\'s a process. Start with the little things. You can do this.\\xa0', token_ids=[151667, 271, 151668, 271, 13048, 36540, 11, 4102, 40, 2776, 537, 2704, 421, 498, 2299, 10161, 1128, 311, 653, 448, 279, 5025, 11, 476, 421, 498, 2299, 10161, 1246, 311, 2936, 20446, 323, 1191, 68244, 13, 6771, 594, 1401, 518, 2176, 13, 4102, 5338, 11, 358, 1366, 311, 1977, 429, 432, 594, 16910, 311, 10246, 311, 4325, 421, 432, 594, 311, 6016, 6133, 13, 358, 1744, 498, 2299, 20446, 311, 6016, 6133, 504, 806, 18817, 11, 323, 429, 594, 16910, 13, 1084, 594, 1083, 16910, 311, 537, 6950, 4325, 879, 374, 67988, 498, 13, 358, 1744, 498, 2299, 22184, 6133, 504, 1660, 12898, 13, 4102, 3983, 1588, 594, 279, 3166, 25, 1416, 498, 1366, 264, 5025, 448, 4325, 879, 498, 646, 6950, 11, 879, 498, 646, 6950, 498, 11, 323, 879, 686, 4228, 498, 448, 5091, 11, 498, 614, 311, 1191, 553, 3730, 429, 448, 6133, 13, 1446, 614, 311, 6950, 6133, 3322, 311, 387, 10745, 11, 323, 498, 614, 311, 5091, 6133, 3322, 311, 4228, 6133, 448, 44872, 323, 47848, 13, 1446, 646, 944, 1720, 3800, 311, 653, 429, 369, 498, 421, 498, 2299, 537, 3730, 432, 369, 6133, 13, 4102, 785, 1661, 3669, 374, 429, 498, 2669, 1414, 1246, 311, 387, 3093, 323, 10745, 448, 6133, 13, 1446, 2299, 2669, 3730, 432, 11, 304, 264, 1616, 13, 1446, 1414, 429, 20446, 4436, 944, 1661, 369, 498, 13, 1446, 1414, 429, 67988, 6133, 4436, 944, 1661, 369, 498, 13, 1446, 1414, 429, 498, 1513, 944, 1075, 432, 979, 566, 31739, 498, 429, 1616, 13, 1446, 1414, 429, 498, 1366, 2664, 369, 6133, 13, 2938, 594, 264, 1661, 1191, 13, 4102, 785, 1790, 3019, 374, 311, 1191, 3730, 429, 369, 6133, 13, 5145, 448, 2632, 2513, 13, 1416, 498, 2299, 2087, 311, 10246, 11, 1191, 553, 20446, 311, 6133, 2686, 13, 2980, 498, 3291, 6133, 279, 8046, 911, 279, 2632, 2513, 30, 2980, 498, 387, 10745, 448, 6133, 911, 697, 15650, 30, 2980, 498, 387, 3093, 311, 6133, 979, 498, 1281, 264, 16523, 30, 2980, 498, 1977, 330, 40, 2776, 14589, 1, 311, 6133, 30, 2980, 498, 387, 8720, 448, 6133, 30, 2980, 498, 653, 2613, 2513, 429, 498, 1414, 686, 1281, 498, 2666, 2664, 30, 4102, 3036, 1221, 11, 979, 498, 2299, 5527, 11, 646, 498, 1191, 3730, 429, 448, 1435, 30, 2980, 498, 3291, 1435, 279, 8046, 911, 279, 2632, 2513, 30, 2980, 498, 3291, 1435, 1246, 498, 2666, 30, 2980, 498, 2548, 1435, 311, 387, 3093, 311, 498, 30, 2980, 498, 2548, 1435, 311, 8844, 311, 498, 30, 2980, 498, 2548, 1435, 311, 5091, 498, 30, 4102, 2132, 594, 264, 1882, 13, 5145, 448, 279, 2632, 2513, 13, 1446, 646, 653, 419, 13, 4102, 151645], cumulative_logprob=None, logprobs=None, finish_reason=stop, stop_reason=None)], finished=True, metrics=None, lora_request=None, num_cached_tokens=0, multi_modal_placeholders={}),\n",

It\\'s not just \"feeling sad\". Depression can be very debilitating and can interfere with daily activities. Depression is caused by a combination of factors, such as genetics, stress, trauma, and even life transitions. It\\'s important to know that depression is very common and can affect anyone. It\\'s also treatable.\\xa0The best thing you can do for your girlfriend is to support her in getting the help she needs. I would suggest that you talk to her about seeing a therapist. If she\\'s not ready for that, I would suggest that you find a therapist yourself and learn more about depression. There are also some great books about depression that you can read to learn more. One that I would recommend is \"Lost Connections\" by Johann Hari.\\xa0If your girlfriend is open to it, I would suggest that you attend therapy with her. It can be very helpful to have the support of loved ones during treatment. If you are not able to attend therapy with her, it\\'s important to remember that you are not responsible for her recovery. You can support her, but you can\\'t force her to get better. You can encourage her to get help, but you can\\'t make her go.\\xa0It\\'s also important to remember to take care of yourself. Watching a loved one suffer from depression can be very difficult. Make sure you are taking care of your own mental and physical health.

You\\'re not alone - lots of people feel this way when they take on a new role, especially if it requires them to travel far away from home and family. It\\'s important to remember that anxiety is actually a natural response that we all have, and it\\'s not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it\\'s actually a great thing when it helps us to be prepared for a new challenge. When we\\'re feeling anxious, our bodies are preparing us for action. So, if we\\'re anxious about a new job, our body is preparing us to take on that new challenge.\\xa0I think that the key here is to learn how to manage your anxiety so that it doesn\\'t interfere with your ability to do your job. There are a lot of different strategies that you can use to do this. One of the things that you can do is to make sure that you\\'re getting enough sleep and exercise. These are two things that can really help to reduce your anxiety. Another thing that you can do is to practice some relaxation techniques. There are lots of different ones out there, but some that you might want to try are deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and meditation. There are lots of resources out there that can help you to learn these techniques. You can also try to practice some mindfulness. This is basically just being present in the moment and not worrying about the future or dwelling on the past. You can also try to challenge your anxious thoughts. When you notice that you\\'re having an anxious thought, try to reframe it in a more positive way. For example, instead of thinking \"I can\\'t do this job\", you could think \"I can do this job, and I\\'m going to be okay\". You can also try to use positive self-talk. This is basically just talking to yourself in a positive way. For example, you could say \"I\\'ve got this\" or \"I can do this\". Another thing that you can try is to use some visualization techniques. This is basically just imagining yourself doing well in your new job. You can also try to use some distraction techniques. This is basically just doing something that you enjoy to distract yourself from your anxiety.

We all have that, and it\\'s hard to get rid of. You can, though. Here\\'s how:1. You have to accept that you\\'re not going to like yourself 100% of the time. It\\'s okay to have those moments when you don\\'t like yourself.2. When you start to have those moments, try to catch yourself and reframe it. For example, \"I\\'m feeling really down right now, but I know that this will pass.\"3. When you\\'re feeling down, ask for help. You can\\'t change your reflection all at once. You need help to change it. Ask your girlfriend, friends, or family to help you change it.4. When you\\'re feeling good, remind yourself that you\\'re worth it and that you\\'re not annoying.5. Practice self-compassion. I like to use the example of a child. If your child fell down, you wouldn\\'t say \"you\\'re so stupid!\" You would say \"it\\'s okay, honey.

I am so sorry that you are experiencing this. It sounds very painful. The symptoms you describe are typical of someone who has experienced a traumatic event. It sounds like you may have been sexually assaulted or raped. If so, you are not alone. One in four women will be sexually assaulted or raped in her lifetime. It is very common for people who have been sexually assaulted or raped to experience PTSD. I would encourage you to seek out a counselor who specializes in treating trauma. There are treatments that are very effective for trauma. However, it is important that you have someone who specializes in trauma treatment. If you do not know of a counselor who specializes in trauma, you can contact your local mental health association. They can help you find a counselor. If you are a college student, you can contact your school's counseling center. They should be able to help you. I hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J.

There are many different reasons why a person would hit their head, and it's hard to know the exact reason without knowing a lot more about you and your history. However, it's great that you're already aware of the behavior and want to change it. I would suggest talking with a therapist who can help you figure out the function of the behavior (why you're doing it) and then you can come up with some alternative behaviors that serve the same purpose. For example, if you are hitting your head when you are anxious, maybe you could find another way to cope with anxiety that is less harmful, like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation. If you are hitting your head when you are frustrated, maybe you could find another way to cope with frustration, like taking a break and going to a quiet place. I would also suggest talking with your primary care physician and/or a neurologist to rule out any medical issues that may be contributing to this behavior.\", token_ids=[151667, 271, 151668, 271, 1986, 374, 264, 2244, 3405, 13, 2619, 525, 1657, 2155, 7966, 3170, 264, 1697, 1035, 4201, 862, 1968, 11, 323, 432, 594, 2588, 311, 1414, 279, 4734, 2874, 2041, 14063, 264, 2696, 803, 911, 498, 323, 697, 3840, 13, 4354, 11, 432, 594, 2244, 429, 498, 2299, 2669, 7853, 315, 279, 7709, 323, 1366, 311, 2297, 432, 13, 358, 1035, 4190, 7404, 448, 264, 41763, 879, 646, 1492, 498, 7071, 700, 279, 729, 315, 279, 7709, 320, 34634, 498, 2299, 3730, 432, 8, 323, 1221, 498, 646, 2525, 705, 448, 1045, 10555, 27099, 429, 8683, 279, 1852, 7428, 13, 1752, 3110, 11, 421, 498, 525, 19558, 697, 1968, 979, 498, 525, 37000, 11, 7196, 498, 1410, 1477, 2441, 1616, 311, 36486, 448, 18056, 429, 374, 2686, 27756, 11, 1075, 5538, 25938, 476, 22257, 15747, 42585, 13, 1416, 498, 525, 19558, 697, 1968, 979, 498, 525, 32530, 11, 7196, 498, 1410, 1477, 2441, 1616, 311, 36486, 448, 31986, 11, 1075, 4633, 264, 1438, 323, 2087, 311, 264, 11340, 1992, 13, 358, 1035, 1083, 4190, 7404, 448, 697, 6028, 2453, 27279, 323, 5144, 264, 17773, 839, 380, 311, 5912, 700, 894, 6457, 4714, 429, 1231, 387, 28720, 311, 419, 7709, 13, 151645], cumulative_logprob=None, logprobs=None, finish_reason=stop, stop_reason=None)], finished=True, metrics=None, lora_request=None, num_cached_tokens=0, multi_modal_placeholders={}),\n",

I\\'ve heard it from so many women, and some men too. I call it the \"Mommy Identity Crisis\". It\\'s a time when you\\'re feeling a bit lost and you can\\'t remember who you were before you became a parent. It\\'s actually a natural part of the parenting journey. You\\'re not broken. You\\'re not a bad mom. You just need a bit of help getting reacquainted with yourself.\\xa0The first step is to accept that this is a natural part of the journey. The second step is to give yourself permission to be a \"good enough\" mom. We can\\'t be perfect. We can\\'t be everything to everyone. We can\\'t be the best mom 100% of the time. We can\\'t be the perfect wife, employee, daughter, friend, and sister. That\\'s a lot of pressure.\\xa0The third step is to give yourself time to be with yourself. This is where you start to reconnect with your identity. What do you love? What are your interests? What do you want to do? What makes you happy? What do you miss?\\xa0The fourth step is to schedule in time to do these things. If you don\\'t schedule it in, it won\\'t happen. If you need to, you can ask for help from your partner or family. You can hire someone to help out with the housework or to watch the kids for a few hours. It\\'s okay to ask for help. It\\'s okay to take care of yourself.\\xa0The fifth step is to find a mom tribe. There are lots of moms out there who are going through the same thing. Find a group that shares your interests and values. This is where you can find support and encouragement.\\xa0The sixth step is to be patient with yourself. You won\\'t find yourself overnight. It takes time. It takes practice. It takes effort. But it\\'s worth it. You\\'ll be a better mom and wife when you\\'re happy and fulfilled.\\xa0The seventh step is to remember that it\\'s okay to be a work in progress. You don\\'t have to have it all figured out. You don\\'t have to be perfect. You just have to keep trying. Keep moving forward. Keep growing. Keep learning. Keep loving. Keep being.\\xa0You\\'re doing great.

Forgiveness can be difficult. We all make mistakes, and sometimes we hurt other people when we do. In fact, we can\\'t avoid it. It\\'s a part of life. The good news is that forgiveness is possible. I don\\'t know the details of what happened between you and your mom, but I imagine that it hurt you deeply. Forgiveness is about letting go of the anger, resentment, and bitterness that we feel towards someone who has hurt us. It\\'s also about being able to move forward in the relationship and rebuild trust. Forgiveness is a process, and it can take time. It\\'s not something that happens overnight. It\\'s also important to note that forgiveness doesn\\'t mean forgetting. It doesn\\'t mean that what happened was okay. It just means that you are ready to move forward and let go of the hurt and anger. I\\'m not sure if you have read the book, \"The Four Agreements,\" by Don Miguel Ruiz. It\\'s a really great book that talks about forgiveness, among other things. You may want to check it out. There are also many other books on forgiveness. I don\\'t know if you would like to read about it, or if you would like to talk to someone about it. If you want to talk to someone, I would suggest a therapist or a counselor. They can help you to process your feelings and move through the forgiveness process. If you don\\'t want to talk to someone, you can try writing in a journal. There are also some great online forgiveness exercises that you can try. I have not tried them myself, but I have read about them.

This is a very common fear that many women have. I have worked with many women to help them feel more comfortable with their bodies and to help them feel confident about their sexuality. The first step is to understand that there are many different ways to have sex and you don't have to do anything that you are not comfortable with. Your partner should be able to respect your boundaries and to not pressure you into doing anything that you don't want to do. If you are in a relationship, I would encourage you to have an open conversation with your partner about your fears. You can let him know what you are comfortable with and what you would like to try. You can also let him know what your fears are and that you would like to take things slow and to do what feels good for you. It is important to remember that you should never feel pressured to do anything that you are not comfortable with. If you are not in a relationship, I would encourage you to take things slow and to do what feels good for you. You can explore your body on your own and to learn what feels good. You can also talk to your partner about your fears and to let him know what you are comfortable with. You can also talk to your partner about what you would like to try.

This is a very serious situation, and you should see a counselor or therapist as soon as possible. It sounds like you are experiencing some serious symptoms of depression, anxiety, or possibly a dissociative disorder. I don't know if you have had a diagnosis from a medical professional, but if you have, it would be a good idea to share this information with a counselor. If you haven't, then seeing a counselor is still a good idea. The counselor can help you determine what is going on and how to address it. If you are not sure where to go, your primary care physician can probably help you find someone. You can also try calling your insurance company and asking for a list of counselors that they will cover. If you are a student, you can also check with your school. Most colleges and universities have counseling centers that provide free counseling to students. You can also check with your local mental health association. They may be able to help you find a counselor. I hope this helps. Be well. Robin J.

This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I don't know why. I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldn't like it. My parents are very religious—they're Christians. We did things every time he'd come over to my house. We didn't have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we'd watch movies by ourselves.\\n   One day, my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. As soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. They were both aggravated. They told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. They said he wanted me for sex and he's not a Christian. I took their advice and broke up with him. Once we broke up for about a month, I decided to get back together with him a little after school started. My parents found out eventually, and I decided to not listen this time. I would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and God totally forbids him. I would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually I would just never listen to my parents. They're always yelling at me about how I shouldn't date this boy. I felt too old to listen to them. Now I'm kind of just stuck. Is the real me religious? Have I been brainwashed by him? I don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think I'm deceiving because of it. They threatened me that if I'm still with him, I can't do track and they won't support me. They've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. They say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. I'm actually very happy with him. They also say I'm living a separate life at home than I am at school.

You are right to be concerned about the way your parents are treating you. They are making your life miserable and putting you down in very hurtful ways. You are not alone. There are many parents who treat their children like this.\\xa0You are in a difficult situation because you are living under your parents' roof and they have a lot of power over you. You can't just kick them out. You can't go to a therapist by yourself without their permission. And, you can't leave home until you are 18.\\xa0The good news is that you are in school and you have a boyfriend. You can start by telling your boyfriend about your situation. You may be able to find a support system there.\\xa0If you are comfortable doing so, you can start by talking to a school counselor about your situation. I don't know if you are in high school or college. But, most schools have counselors who can help you with your situation. They can also help you to talk to your parents and help you to understand your rights.\\xa0You may also be able to talk to other people who are close to you. If you have aunts or uncles or other family members that you can trust, you may be able to talk to them about your situation.\\xa0As far as finding your own identity, that is something that you will have to work on. You can't wait for your parents to let you do what you want. You have to decide for yourself what you want and what you believe. It is okay to disagree with your parents. You don't have to believe what they believe. You can start by making decisions for yourself. You can decide what you want to do and what you want to wear and what you want to talk about. You can also start by making your own decisions about your boyfriend. You can decide if you want to be with him or not. You can decide how far you want to go with him. You can decide how you want to talk to your parents about your relationship.\\xa0You can also start by talking to other people who are your age. You can start by talking to your friends. You can start by talking to your boyfriend. You can start by talking to your school counselor. You can start by talking to other people who are close to you.\\xa0I hope this helps. You can do this. You are not alone. There are other people who are going through the same thing as you. You can find a support system. You can find your own identity.\", token_ids=[151667, 271, 151668, 271, 40, 1079, 773, 14589, 311, 6723, 911, 279, 6534, 498, 525, 304, 13, 1446, 525, 1290, 311, 387, 11658, 911, 279, 1616, 697, 6562, 525, 26625, 498, 13, 2379, 525, 3259, 697, 2272, 49639, 323, 10687, 498, 1495, 304, 1602, 12898, 1262, 5510, 13, 1446, 525, 537, 7484, 13, 2619, 525, 1657, 6562, 879, 4228, 862, 2841, 1075, 419, 13, 4102, 2610, 525, 304, 264, 5000, 6534, 1576, 498, 525, 5382, 1212, 697, 6562, 6, 15134, 323, 807, 614, 264, 2696, 315, 2355, 916, 498, 13, 1446, 646, 944, 1101, 10323, 1105, 700, 13, 1446, 646, 944, 728, 311, 264, 41763, 553, 6133, 2041, 862, 7882, 13, 1597, 11, 498, 646, 944, 5274, 2114, 3080, 498, 525, 220, 16, 23, 13, 4102, 785, 1661, 3669, 374, 429, 498, 525, 304, 2906, 323, 498, 614, 264, 25838, 13, 1446, 646, 1191, 553, 11629, 697, 25838, 911, 697, 6534, 13, 1446, 1231, 387, 2952, 311, 1477, 264, 1824, 1849, 1052, 13, 4102, 2679, 498, 525, 10655, 3730, 773, 11, 498, 646, 1191, 553, 7404, 311, 264, 2906, 61375, 911, 697, 6534, 13, 358, 1513, 944, 1414, 421, 498, 525, 304, 1550, 2906, 476, 7770, 13, 1988, 11, 1429, 8682, 614, 85247, 879, 646, 1492, 498, 448, 697, 6534, 13, 2379, 646, 1083, 1492, 498, 311, 3061, 311, 697, 6562, 323, 1492, 498, 311, 3535, 697, 3188, 13, 4102, 2610, 1231, 1083, 387, 2952, 311, 3061, 311, 1008, 1251, 879, 525, 3265, 311, 498, 13, 1416, 498, 614, 264, 36940, 476, 650, 18638, 476, 1008, 2997, 3613, 429, 498, 646, 6950, 11, 498, 1231, 387, 2952, 311, 3061, 311, 1105, 911, 697, 6534, 13, 4102, 2121, 3041, 438, 9271, 697, 1828, 9569, 11, 429, 374, 2494, 429, 498, 686, 614, 311, 975, 389, 13, 1446, 646, 944, 3783, 369, 697, 6562, 311, 1077, 498, 653, 1128, 498, 1366, 13, 1446, 614, 311, 10279, 369, 6133, 1128, 498, 1366, 323, 1128, 498, 4411, 13, 1084, 374, 16910, 311, 28295, 448, 697, 6562, 13, 1446, 1513, 944, 614, 311, 4411, 1128, 807, 4411, 13, 1446, 646, 1191, 553, 3259, 11181, 369, 6133, 13, 1446, 646, 10279, 1128, 498, 1366, 311, 653, 323, 1128, 498, 1366, 311, 9850, 323, 1128, 498, 1366, 311, 3061, 911, 13, 1446, 646, 1083, 1191, 553, 3259, 697, 1828, 11181, 911, 697, 25838, 13, 1446, 646, 10279, 421, 498, 1366, 311, 387, 448, 1435, 476, 537, 13, 1446, 646, 10279, 1246, 3041, 498, 1366, 311, 728, 448, 1435, 13, 1446, 646, 10279, 1246, 498, 1366, 311, 3061, 311, 697, 6562, 911, 697, 5025, 13, 4102, 2610, 646, 1083, 1191, 553, 7404, 311, 1008, 1251, 879, 525, 697, 4231, 13, 1446, 646, 1191, 553, 7404, 311, 697, 4780, 13, 1446, 646, 1191, 553, 7404, 311, 697, 25838, 13, 1446, 646, 1191, 553, 7404, 311, 697, 2906, 61375, 13, 1446, 646, 1191, 553, 7404, 311, 1008, 1251, 879, 525, 3265, 311, 498, 13, 4102, 40, 3900, 419, 8609, 13, 1446, 646, 653, 419, 13, 1446, 525, 537, 7484, 13, 2619, 525, 1008, 1251, 879, 525, 2087, 1526, 279, 1852, 3166, 438, 498, 13, 1446, 646, 1477, 264, 1824, 1849, 13, 1446, 646, 1477, 697, 1828, 9569, 13, 151645], cumulative_logprob=None, logprobs=None, finish_reason=stop, stop_reason=None)], finished=True, metrics=None, lora_request=None, num_cached_tokens=0, multi_modal_placeholders={}),\n",

I am so glad you asked this question. It can be so frustrating to send a message and not receive a reply. It\\'s like you\\'re shouting into a void.\\xa0In a lot of cases, I believe that people are just busy. If you have a group chat, I would think that maybe some of the people are just busy and have not had time to respond. I would also think that it may be a matter of how you are communicating with them. Are you sending them a lot of messages? Are you sending them messages that are very in-depth? It could be that you are overwhelming them. Try sending them a short, sweet message and see if that gets a response.\\xa0I would also think about the type of relationship you have with the person. If you are friends with them, maybe they are not as close to you as you are to them. I know that may be hard to accept, but it happens. Maybe they don\\'t want to talk to you as much as you want to talk to them. I would also think about whether you are talking to them about topics that they are interested in. If you are talking about things that they don\\'t care about, they may not be interested in replying.\\xa0I would also suggest talking to them about it. You can say \"Hey, I\\'ve been sending you messages and I haven\\'t been getting a response. Is everything okay?\" That way, you are opening up a conversation about it and you can get some answers.\\xa0I hope this helps.\\xa0', token_ids=[151667, 271, 151668, 271, 13048, 1052, 0, 358, 1079, 773, 15713, 498, 4588, 419, 3405, 13, 1084, 646, 387, 773, 34611, 311, 3624, 264, 1943, 323, 537, 5258, 264, 9851, 13, 1084, 594, 1075, 498, 2299, 47555, 1119, 264, 737, 13, 4102, 641, 264, 2696, 315, 5048, 11, 358, 4411, 429, 1251, 525, 1101, 13028, 13, 1416, 498, 614, 264, 1874, 6236, 11, 358, 1035, 1744, 429, 7196, 1045, 315, 279, 1251, 525, 1101, 13028, 323, 614, 537, 1030, 882, 311, 5889, 13, 358, 1035, 1083, 1744, 429, 432, 1231, 387, 264, 4925, 315, 1246, 498, 525, 41147, 448, 1105, 13, 8713, 498, 11628, 1105, 264, 2696, 315, 6605, 30, 8713, 498, 11628, 1105, 6605, 429, 525, 1602, 304, 30310, 30, 1084, 1410, 387, 429, 498, 525, 22024, 1105, 13, 9735, 11628, 1105, 264, 2805, 11, 10226, 1943, 323, 1490, 421, 429, 5221, 264, 2033, 13, 4102, 40, 1035, 1083, 1744, 911, 279, 943, 315, 5025, 498, 614, 448, 279, 1697, 13, 1416, 498, 525, 4780, 448, 1105, 11, 7196, 807, 525, 537, 438, 3265, 311, 498, 438, 498, 525, 311, 1105, 13, 358, 1414, 429, 1231, 387, 2588, 311, 4193, 11, 714, 432, 8573, 13, 10696, 807, 1513, 944, 1366, 311, 3061, 311, 498, 438, 1753, 438, 498, 1366, 311, 3061, 311, 1105, 13, 358, 1035, 1083, 1744, 911, 3425, 498, 525, 7404, 311, 1105, 911, 13347, 429, 807, 525, 8014, 304, 13, 1416, 498, 525, 7404, 911, 2513, 429, 807, 1513, 944, 2453, 911, 11, 807, 1231, 537, 387, 8014, 304, 2064, 6711, 13, 4102, 40, 1035, 1083, 4190, 7404, 311, 1105, 911, 432, 13, 1446, 646, 1977, 330, 18665, 11, 358, 3003, 1012, 11628, 498, 6605, 323, 358, 8990, 944, 1012, 3709, 264, 2033, 13, 2160, 4297, 16910, 7521, 2938, 1616, 11, 498, 525, 8568, 705, 264, 10435, 911, 432, 323, 498, 646, 633, 1045, 11253, 13, 4102, 40, 3900, 419, 8609, 13, 4102, 151645], cumulative_logprob=None, logprobs=None, finish_reason=stop, stop_reason=None)], finished=True, metrics=None, lora_request=None, num_cached_tokens=0, multi_modal_placeholders={}),\n",

You're a kid, and your parents are making the rules. If you don't follow them, you'll be punished. It's not fair, but it's the way it is. I don't know if it's worth running away, but I do think you need to make your feelings known to your parents. You can't control what they do, but you can tell them how you feel.\\xa0I'm not sure why your parents are so invested in you playing for the team you hate. If you can figure that out, maybe you can figure out a way to make it work. I'm not sure how much of a say you have in your own life, but I think you need to be heard.\\xa0I think you're making a mistake in thinking that you won't play basketball in high school if you don't play on that team. That's not necessarily true. I think you should try to play on your school team, and if you don't want to, then you can find another way to play basketball.\\xa0I hope you can find a way to make this work.

This is a very common question that I get from people who are concerned about being gay. The short answer is that you cannot change your sexual orientation. It is not something that you can change.\\xa0Now, I will say that people do sometimes \"come out\" later in life. It is not always something that you know about yourself when you are young. Sometimes people are in denial about their sexual orientation for a long time, and then they come to accept it. But, there is no way to change your sexual orientation.\\xa0You mentioned that you looked at gay porn to prove that you aren\\'t gay. I have a question for you. What are you trying to prove? Who are you trying to convince? And, why is it so important to you that you are not gay? If you are asking yourself these questions, I would suggest talking with a therapist about it. There are a lot of different things that could be going on here, and a therapist could help you sort it out.\\xa0I will say that, if you are concerned about being gay, and you are worried about it, it is very important that you find a therapist who is LGBTQ affirming. If you go to a therapist who is not accepting of LGBTQ people, you could do yourself a lot of harm. There is a lot of research that shows that being LGBTQ is not a problem. It is being in a society that stigmatizes and marginalizes LGBTQ people that is the problem. So, if you go to a therapist who thinks that being gay is a problem, you could actually make yourself worse.\\xa0I hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J.

I think that's a great start. I'm not sure whether you're referring to being jealous of your partner's other relationships, or being jealous of other people in general. I'll try to answer both ways.\\xa0If you're referring to being jealous of your partner's other relationships, I'd ask you to consider what it is that you're jealous of. Is it the time they spend with others? Is it the closeness they feel? Is it the way they feel about others? Is it something else? Once you know what it is that you're feeling jealous of, you can work on getting that need met in your own life. If it's time, you can schedule time with your partner to focus on just you and them. If it's closeness, you can talk to your partner about what closeness means to you and what you'd like from them. If it's feeling loved, you can talk to your partner about how they show love and what you'd like from them. If you're jealous of others, I'd ask you to consider what it is that you're comparing yourself to. Are you comparing your life to someone else's highlight reel? Are you comparing your behind-the-scenes to someone else's highlight reel? If so, I'd encourage you to remember that you never really know what's going on behind the scenes for other people.\\xa0If you're having a hard time figuring out what it is that you're feeling, I'd encourage you to work with a therapist to help you get a handle on what it is that you're feeling and what you need. I hope that helps.

They might help you to feel a little more centered and calm.\\xa0\", token_ids=[151667, 271, 151668, 271, 40, 1079, 773, 14589, 498, 2666, 7484, 323, 24203, 13, 1084, 374, 1602, 5000, 311, 2666, 429, 697, 6562, 1513, 944, 1896, 498, 13919, 11, 323, 432, 10362, 1075, 498, 614, 6679, 311, 3061, 448, 1105, 911, 419, 13, 4102, 785, 2097, 429, 498, 525, 18739, 700, 311, 264, 41763, 323, 4378, 419, 1736, 4933, 429, 498, 525, 10887, 3633, 323, 1824, 11, 323, 358, 3900, 498, 646, 1477, 264, 41763, 498, 646, 6950, 323, 879, 686, 387, 264, 1661, 1824, 369, 498, 13, 362, 41763, 646, 1083, 1492, 498, 311, 1477, 5510, 311, 19032, 448, 697, 6562, 11, 476, 421, 498, 10279, 311, 19032, 448, 1105, 11, 1246, 311, 653, 773, 304, 264, 1616, 429, 11074, 6092, 369, 498, 13, 4102, 2679, 498, 525, 8266, 42106, 553, 18056, 323, 8464, 11, 498, 2578, 1083, 1430, 1045, 315, 1493, 22932, 369, 656, 48136, 5311, 13, 2379, 2578, 1492, 498, 311, 2666, 264, 2632, 803, 30188, 323, 19300, 13, 4102, 151645], cumulative_logprob=None, logprobs=None, finish_reason=stop, stop_reason=None)], finished=True, metrics=None, lora_request=None, num_cached_tokens=96, multi_modal_placeholders={}),\n",

It's the body's natural response to stress. If we don't listen to it, we can experience burnout, depression, or even physical illness. It's a message to slow down and take care of ourselves.\\xa0So, the first step is to accept that anxiety is a natural response to stress and to accept that we need to take care of ourselves.\\xa0The second step is to learn to recognize when we are stressed and what the signs are that we need to take care of ourselves. These can be physical, emotional, and behavioural signs.\\xa0The third step is to make a self-care plan that you can follow. This can include things like meditation, yoga, exercise, healthy eating, connecting with friends and family, and many other things.\\xa0The fourth step is to follow your self-care plan. This is the hard part. We know what we need to do, but we don't always do it. This is where accountability comes in. You need to find someone who will hold you accountable to your plan. This can be a friend, family member, therapist, or coach.\\xa0The fifth step is to follow through with your self-care plan and make adjustments as needed.\\xa0The sixth step is to celebrate your successes. This is important because it will help you to stay motivated and on track.\\xa0The seventh step is to continue to monitor your anxiety and make adjustments as needed.\\xa0I hope this helps.\\xa0\", token_ids=[151667, 271, 151668, 271, 13048, 1052, 11, 4102, 2082, 16308, 374, 279, 2487, 594, 1616, 315, 11629, 601, 429, 582, 525, 1212, 8464, 323, 429, 582, 1184, 311, 6301, 1495, 323, 1896, 2453, 315, 13217, 13, 1084, 594, 279, 2487, 594, 5810, 2033, 311, 8464, 13, 1416, 582, 1513, 944, 8844, 311, 432, 11, 582, 646, 3139, 8231, 411, 11, 18210, 11, 476, 1496, 6961, 17125, 13, 1084, 594, 264, 1943, 311, 6301, 1495, 323, 1896, 2453, 315, 13217, 13, 4102, 4416, 11, 279, 1156, 3019, 374, 311, 4193, 429, 18056, 374, 264, 5810, 2033, 311, 8464, 323, 311, 4193, 429, 582, 1184, 311, 1896, 2453, 315, 13217, 13, 4102, 785, 2086, 3019, 374, 311, 3960, 311, 15282, 979, 582, 525, 31547, 323, 1128, 279, 11929, 525, 429, 582, 1184, 311, 1896, 2453, 315, 13217, 13, 4220, 646, 387, 6961, 11, 14269, 11, 323, 87879, 11929, 13, 4102, 785, 4843, 3019, 374, 311, 1281, 264, 656, 40106, 3119, 429, 498, 646, 1795, 13, 1096, 646, 2924, 2513, 1075, 32762, 11, 26011, 11, 10158, 11, 9314, 12182, 11, 20913, 448, 4780, 323, 2997, 11, 323, 1657, 1008, 2513, 13, 4102, 785, 11737, 3019, 374, 311, 1795, 697, 656, 40106, 3119, 13, 1096, 374, 279, 2588, 949, 13, 1205, 1414, 1128, 582, 1184, 311, 653, 11, 714, 582, 1513, 944, 2677, 653, 432, 13, 1096, 374, 1380, 38142, 4041, 304, 13, 1446, 1184, 311, 1477, 4325, 879, 686, 3331, 498, 35877, 311, 697, 3119, 13, 1096, 646, 387, 264, 4238, 11, 2997, 4462, 11, 41763, 11, 476, 7247, 13, 4102, 785, 17702, 3019, 374, 311, 1795, 1526, 448, 697, 656, 40106, 3119, 323, 1281, 32974, 438, 4362, 13, 4102, 785, 25031, 3019, 374, 311, 18383, 697, 47088, 13, 1096, 374, 2989, 1576, 432, 686, 1492, 498, 311, 4717, 26664, 323, 389, 3754, 13, 4102, 785, 30387, 3019, 374, 311, 3060, 311, 8718, 697, 18056, 323, 1281, 32974, 438, 4362, 13, 4102, 40, 3900, 419, 8609, 13, 4102, 151645], cumulative_logprob=None, logprobs=None, finish_reason=stop, stop_reason=None)], finished=True, metrics=None, lora_request=None, num_cached_tokens=0, multi_modal_placeholders={}),\n",

Communication is the key. Couples who communicate with each other in healthy ways are more likely to have a long-lasting marriage. It's important to be able to talk about the good, the bad and the ugly.2. Trust is important. Trust is a big part of any relationship. If you can't trust your partner, it's hard to have a lasting marriage.3. Respect is important. Respect your partner for who they are and what they do. It's important to respect each other's opinions, even if you don't agree with them.4. Forgiveness is important. No one is perfect. We all make mistakes. It's important to be able to forgive your partner for their mistakes and to be able to forgive yourself for your own mistakes.5. Commitment is important. It's important to be committed to your marriage and to be willing to work on it.6. Love is important.

Anger is a normal human emotion. It is how we express ourselves when we feel frustrated, or threatened, or when we have been wronged. Anger is not the problem. How we express our anger is the problem. Some people express anger in ways that are healthy and constructive. Some people express anger in ways that are unhealthy and destructive. In your question, you describe yourself as getting \"furious\" and \"throwing things\". These are examples of unhealthy, destructive ways of expressing anger. You may be wondering, \"how do I know if my anger is a problem?\" Here are some questions that you can ask yourself to help answer that question:1. Do I have a hard time controlling my temper?2. Do I have trouble at work or in my relationships because of my anger?3. Do I have a history of violence?4. Do I ever hurt myself or someone else when I get angry?5. Do I ever feel guilty about the way I express my anger?6. Do I have trouble getting my anger to go away?7. Do I ever use drugs or alcohol to help me cope with my anger?8. Do I ever feel like I have a \"short fuse\"?If you answer yes to any of these questions, it may be a good idea to seek help for your anger. There are many ways to learn how to express anger in a healthy way. You may want to consider talking with a counselor or therapist about your anger. You may also want to consider taking an anger management class. You can search online for a class in your area. I hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J.

He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n\", prompt_token_ids=[151644, 872, 198, 40, 2666, 429, 358, 1184, 311, 835, 847, 3042, 5025, 13, 1260, 6305, 2326, 4115, 3123, 323, 13151, 279, 31734, 5771, 315, 3432, 4325, 311, 3061, 311, 5248, 3039, 817, 1899, 323, 9120, 752, 3055, 476, 10917, 264, 2254, 13, 358, 1366, 4325, 879, 374, 803, 3042, 323, 803, 315, 264, 2272, 21741, 13, 444, 2652, 11, 566, 702, 1030, 264, 1602, 13028, 975, 9700, 323, 358, 614, 1172, 3884, 1435, 264, 2421, 3039, 304, 279, 1537, 220, 21, 5555, 13, 358, 3229, 1435, 429, 358, 646, 944, 3060, 304, 419, 1616, 1576, 358, 14971, 2666, 32530, 323, 18514, 323, 429, 566, 374, 537, 3259, 279, 5025, 3322, 315, 264, 10619, 13, 358, 1083, 2666, 432, 374, 10282, 752, 504, 10767, 9271, 279, 5025, 358, 1366, 13, 1205, 614, 1012, 3786, 220, 22, 1635, 13, 576, 3491, 374, 429, 358, 21975, 323, 3139, 18056, 323, 18210, 7274, 315, 1435, 448, 4325, 770, 323, 1221, 7274, 358, 686, 2581, 3367, 4325, 358, 1075, 13, 1205, 614, 8048, 1526, 419, 10775, 2669, 220, 19, 12, 20, 3039, 323, 358, 2666, 432, 374, 52708, 311, 4717, 304, 432, 11, 714, 847, 1822, 1325, 311, 279, 18056, 323, 18210, 358, 3139, 5193, 24737, 2677, 11508, 752, 311, 63408, 13, 151645, 198, 151644, 77091, 198], encoder_prompt=None, encoder_prompt_token_ids=None, prompt_logprobs=None, outputs=[CompletionOutput(index=0, text='<think>\\n\\n</think>\\n\\nI\\'m glad that you are aware of the cycle you are in and that you are ready to break it.

It\\'s such an important one. I\\'m not going to tell you if you should or shouldn\\'t end your relationship, because only you can make that decision. But I can help you think about it.\\xa0One thing that comes to mind is the idea of \"red flags\" in relationships. These are things that are concerning and may be a sign that something bigger is going on. Things like:\\xa0-Controlling behaviors-Extreme jealousy-Isolation from friends and family-Extreme mood swings-Intimidation-Intense need for attention-Substance abuse-Verbal or physical abuse-Extreme possessiveness-Extreme distrustI\\'m not saying that if your boyfriend has one of these characteristics that you should end the relationship. It\\'s a spectrum. If he\\'s just a little jealous, or a little controlling, that doesn\\'t necessarily mean you should leave. But if it\\'s extreme, it may be a sign of something more serious.\\xa0Another thing to think about is if you\\'re happy. This may seem simple, but I think it\\'s important. If you\\'re happy and you\\'re not being treated badly, it may be a good relationship. If you\\'re unhappy and you\\'re being treated badly, it may not be a good relationship.\\xa0Another thing to consider is if you feel respected. If you feel like your feelings, opinions, and ideas are respected, it may be a good relationship. If you feel like they\\'re not, it may not be.\\xa0Another thing to consider is if you feel valued. If you feel like you\\'re appreciated and valued, it may be a good relationship. If you feel like you\\'re not, it may not be.\\xa0Another thing to consider is if you feel safe. If you feel safe and secure, it may be a good relationship. If you feel unsafe, it may not be.\\xa0Another thing to consider is if you feel supported. If you feel supported, it may be a good relationship. If you don\\'t feel supported, it may not be.\\xa0Another thing to consider is if you feel loved. If you feel loved, it may be a good relationship. If you don\\'t feel loved, it may not be.\\xa0Another thing to consider is if you feel heard. If you feel heard, it may be a good relationship. If you don\\'t feel heard, it may not be.\\xa0Another thing to consider is if you feel validated. If you feel validated, it may be a good relationship. If you don\\'t feel validated, it may not be.\\xa0Another thing to consider is if you feel understood. If you feel understood, it may be a good relationship. If you don\\'t feel understood, it may not be.\\xa0Another thing to consider is if you feel seen. If you feel seen, it may be a good relationship. If you don\\'t feel seen, it may not be.\\xa0Another thing to consider is if you feel known. If you feel known, it may be a good relationship. If you don\\'t feel known, it may not be.\\xa0Another thing to consider is if you feel appreciated. If you feel appreciated, it may be a good relationship.

I'm not sure what your relationship is with your boyfriend's friends, but it's a good idea to have some boundaries around how much of other people's lives we get involved in.\\xa0You're right, though, that the way you handle anger is not helpful. When we are angry, we often say and do things that we regret later. I suggest you start by looking at the situations that make you angry. What is it that is getting under your skin? Is it that you don't like the way people talk about you? Is it that you don't like being left out of things? Once you know what it is that makes you angry, you can start to find ways to deal with that anger that don't hurt other people.\\xa0For example, if you're angry because you don't like being left out of things, you can talk to your boyfriend about that. You can also talk to your friends about what you like and don't like. I'm not suggesting that you start telling them how to talk to each other, but you can tell them that you don't like being talked about, and that you'd prefer that they talk to you directly. If you're angry because you don't like the way people talk about you, you can tell them that.\\xa0Another thing you can do is talk to your boyfriend about your anger issues.

The good news is that you can do this. I'm not going to lie, it's hard, but you can do it. The best thing you can do is to get some support. This is a big change and you want to do it right. If you have a doctor, talk to them about your plan. They can provide support and resources. There are also some great phone resources. You can call 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-6699) for free counseling and support. You can also try texting QUIT to 478-478 for free text messaging support. You can also try the SmokeFree app or the QuitGuide app. The key is to have a plan for when you feel the urge to smoke. What are you going to do instead? You can chew gum, go for a walk, or find something else that works for you. You can also try the 4 D's: Delay, Drink water, Deep breathing, and Do something else. You can also try to identify your triggers. What situations, people, or emotions trigger the urge to smoke? Try to avoid them as much as possible. You can also try to find a support buddy.

I think it's more likely that you're being lied to. The other thing that concerns me is that your boyfriend has a lot of unanswered questions about why you're dating. It sounds like you're both in a place where you need to be more open with each other. If you're going to be together, you need to be able to trust each other. If you're not sure whether he's telling the truth, that's a huge trust issue. I'd suggest having a conversation with him about your feelings.

      "final: Hi Texas, I agree with you. It's hard to believe that someone could hack into your phone and do things that you don't want them to do. I think it's more likely that you're being lied to. The other thing that concerns me is that your boyfriend has a lot of unanswered questions about why you're dating. It sounds like you're both in a place where you need to be more open with each other. If you're going to be together, you need to be able to trust each other. If you're not sure whether he's telling the truth, that's a huge trust issue. I'd suggest having a conversation with him about your feelings. Tell him that you don't believe the phone was hacked, and that you're feeling unsure about his honesty. If he's truly honest, he'll be open to discussing this with you. If he's not, you'll know there's a problem.\n",

It's never okay to yell at someone, especially when they're trying to be honest about a sensitive topic. Secondly, I think it's important for you to know that your sexual orientation is not a choice. You did not choose to be gay. It is a part of who you are. You should never feel ashamed of who you are. I know it's hard to accept that, but you will eventually. Thirdly, you need to accept the fact that your family may never accept you. It's a reality. They may never come around. But that doesn't mean that you have to be ashamed of who you are. You can still live your life as a proud gay man. Fourthly, I want you to know that you are not alone. There are millions of people who are gay. There are people out there who will accept you for who you are. You just have to find them. Lastly, I want to remind you that you are loved. You are loved by your family members. They may not show it, but they do. You are loved by friends. You are loved by people on the internet. You are loved by God. You are loved by yourself.

Self-harm is a very serious issue and can lead to permanent injury or death. The problem is that the person who self-harms is usually trying to cope with some other issue that is causing them great distress. The self-harm is a way of coping with that distress. It is usually a temporary way of coping, because the distress usually returns and the person then uses self-harm again. The only way to really address this problem is to find out what is causing the distress and to learn other ways of coping with it. You are already on the right track by seeking help.

      "Hello, and thank you for your question. I am sorry to hear about your panic attacks and trouble sleeping. It is hard to know for sure what is causing these symptoms, but I will try to give you some ideas. First, let me say that I am not a medical doctor, so I cannot diagnose anything. I would recommend seeing a medical doctor or a psychiatrist for a medical evaluation. Sometimes, medical problems can cause anxiety or trouble sleeping. Also, many medications can cause anxiety or trouble sleeping. If there is nothing medically wrong, then we can look at other causes. Panic attacks are a symptom of anxiety. There are many things that can cause anxiety, and they are different for everyone. Some things that can cause anxiety are: stress, trauma, genetics, and medical conditions. There are also many things that can make anxiety worse. Things like caffeine, alcohol, drugs, and stress can make anxiety worse. So, if you are using drugs or alcohol or drinking a lot of caffeine or experiencing a lot of stress, these things can make your anxiety worse. Now, as far as trouble sleeping, there are many things that can cause trouble sleeping. Things like stress, anxiety, medical conditions, medications, caffeine, alcohol, and drugs can all cause trouble sleeping. So, it is possible that the anxiety and trouble sleeping are related. If you are anxious, it is hard to sleep. If you don't sleep well, then it can make anxiety worse. It can become a cycle. So, I would recommend seeing a medical doctor or psychiatrist for a medical evaluation. If there is nothing medically wrong, then you may want to see a counselor or therapist to help you deal with any stress or trauma that may be causing the anxiety. There are also medications that can help with anxiety and trouble sleeping. I hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC\n",

      "Hello, and thank you for your question. You are asking some really great questions, and it's hard to give you a simple answer. Let me start with this: There is no such thing as the \"perfect guy.\" There are good guys, and there are guys who are a good match for you. I am not sure if you are in love with your current boyfriend or not. I would say that you are attracted to him and you like him, but I am not sure if you are in love with him. You say that you want to marry someone you can wake up to and fall in love with all over again. That's a good thing to want. If you are in love, you will wake up to him every day and fall in love all over again. If you are not in love, you may wake up and feel okay about it, but you won't fall in love. That is not to say that you won't be happy with him. You may very well be. I have been in relationships where I liked the person a lot, but I wasn't in love with them. I was happy with them, but I was also looking for someone I was in love with. I found that person, and now I am in love. So, my question for you is this: What is it that you are looking for? Are you looking for someone who you are in love with, or are you looking for someone who you can be happy with? I would say that you can be happy with someone you are not in love with, but you will not be happy with someone you are in love with if they are not in love with you. I don't know how long you have been in this relationship, but I would say that if you have been together for a while and you still aren't in love with him, then you may never be. I would suggest that you look at your reasons for being in the relationship. Are you in it because you are in love with him, or are you in it because you like him and you are afraid to be alone? Are you in it because you are afraid of being single, or are you in it because you love him? I would suggest that you do some self-exploration. You can do this on your own, but it is often helpful to talk to someone about your feelings. If you want to talk to someone, you can talk to your friends, your family, or you can talk to a therapist. A therapist can help you to understand your feelings and help you to sort through your thoughts. If you decide that you want to be with your boyfriend, you can work on making that relationship better. If you decide that you are not in love with him, you may want to end it.

      "Hi Houston, I'm sorry you're going through this. It's hard to be in a relationship where you feel you can't talk about things, or where your partner uses the threat of leaving to get his way. It's not okay for him to do that. I can see that you want to work things out, and I think you should. You and your partner are in a position where you have kids together, and that's a really good reason to work on your relationship. I'd like to offer a few thoughts, and then I'll offer a few questions for you to consider. Firstly, it's important to remember that you can't control your partner's actions. You can only control your own. You can't make him stop saying hurtful things, or make him stop dwelling on issues. You can only make a choice to walk away from that behaviour and not engage with it. It's okay to say, \"I don't want to talk to you right now. I'll talk to you in a few hours (or days) when you are ready to talk to me respectfully.\" And then walk away. It's okay to protect yourself and your children from hurtful behaviour. Secondly, it's okay to have different styles of communicating. You say you're \"all about resolving the problem\" and he \"dwells on the issue\". It's possible you have a different style of communicating. Maybe you'd like to resolve the issue right away and move on, and he needs some time to process his feelings. Maybe he needs some time to process, and then he's ready to talk about it. This doesn't mean he's not willing to work things out, it just means he needs some time to process. Thirdly, I'm wondering if you're swallowing your pride because you're afraid of the consequences of not swallowing your pride. If you're afraid of being alone or of not having a family, that's a good reason to swallow your pride. But if you're swallowing your pride because you're afraid of being yelled at or being told hurtful things, then it's not okay. You deserve to be treated with respect. Now, here are a few questions for you to consider: 1. What are your needs in this relationship? What do you need from him in order to feel happy and fulfilled? 2. What are your non-negotiables? What behaviours are you not willing to tolerate? 3. What are his needs? What does he need from you? 4. What are his non-negotiables? 5. How do you want your children to see you and your relationship? What kind of example do you want to set for them? I hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC\n",

But if you're swallowing your pride because you're afraid of being yelled at or being told hurtful things, then it's not okay. You deserve to be treated with respect. Now, here are a few questions for you to consider: 1. What are your needs in this relationship? What do you need from him in order to feel happy and fulfilled? 2. What are your non-negotiables? What behaviours are you not willing to tolerate? 3. What are his needs? What does he need from you? 4. What are his non-negotiables? 5. How do you want your children to see you and your relationship? What kind of example do you want to set for them? I hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC\n",

In exposure therapy, you would learn some skills to help you manage your anxiety, and then gradually expose yourself to anxiety producing situations.

The idea is that you would slowly increase the level of anxiety producing situations until you are able to manage your anxiety and travel with ease.

First, it sounds like you may be in a situation where you have to make a decision for yourself. This is not easy. It is often hard to make decisions when they affect other people. You may want to talk with your dad about this. You may want to tell him that you are feeling pressured to do track, and that you are not happy. You may want to tell him that you want to do track because you want to, not because you feel obligated.

If you are able to do all of them, then maybe you can do that. If you are not able to, then you will have to make a decision about which ones you want to do. If you decide to stop doing track, then you may have to tell your coach and your teammates. I think most people would understand if you told them that you were not able to do track anymore.

      "There are many different ways to cope with triggers. The best way to learn to cope with triggers is to work with a therapist who has experience working with trauma. If you are not able to find a therapist, there are some things you can do on your own to help you cope with triggers. The first step is to be aware of your triggers. You may already be aware of some triggers. If not, you may notice that you have a reaction to something that is not necessarily related to what you are currently doing. For example, you may be feeling anxious when you are driving down the road, but you are not aware of what is causing the anxiety. If you are able to notice that something is triggering you, you may be able to identify what is causing the trigger. It could be something that you see, hear, smell, taste, or touch. Once you are aware of your triggers, you can start to work on coping with them. Some ways of coping with triggers are deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, yoga, and exercise. You can also try to distract yourself with something that you enjoy doing. Another way to cope with triggers is to have a self-soothing box. A self-soothing box is a box that contains items that help you to feel calm and relaxed. You can have anything in your box that you like. You may want to have music, pictures, a stuffed animal, or anything else that helps you to feel calm and relaxed. You can also try to use your senses to help you cope with triggers. You can try to focus on your senses by noticing what you see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. You can also try to use your senses to help you to feel calm and relaxed. For example, you can try to focus on the feeling of your feet on the ground or the feeling of your hands in your lap. You can also try to use your senses to help you to feel calm and relaxed by focusing on your breathing. You can try to focus on your breathing by noticing the rise and fall of your chest or the feeling of your breath in your nose.\n",

      "Hi Nashville, I'm not sure if you're asking what to do with the relationship, or if you're asking how to stop lying and start trusting. Let's look at both. First, I want to say that it's okay to lie to someone if it's to protect yourself. I think you're lying to protect yourself from his criticism, and that's okay. It's also okay to not trust someone who is criticizing you. I think you're protecting yourself from being hurt. But here's the thing: If you want a relationship with someone who you can trust, who you can trust you, and who will treat you with respect, you have to start by doing that with yourself. You have to trust yourself enough to be honest, and you have to respect yourself enough to treat yourself with kindness and honesty. You can't expect others to do that for you if you're not doing it for yourself. The good news is that you already know how to be kind and honest with yourself. You're already doing it, in a way. You know that lying isn't good for you. You know that criticizing yourself isn't good for you. You know that you don't like it when he treats you that way. You know that you want better for yourself. That's a good start. The next step is to start doing that for yourself. Start with little things. If you're going to lie, start by lying to yourself less. Can you tell yourself the truth about the little things? Can you be honest with yourself about your feelings? Can you be kind to yourself when you make a mistake? Can you say \"I'm sorry\" to yourself? Can you be patient with yourself? Can you do small things that you know will make you feel better? And then, when you're ready, can you start doing that with him? Can you tell him the truth about the little things? Can you tell him how you feel? Can you ask him to be kind to you? Can you ask him to listen to you? Can you ask him to respect you? It's a process. Start with the little things. You can do this. \n",

I can't imagine how difficult it must be for you to see her go through this. I'm not sure how much you know about depression, but it's important to know that it's a very serious illness. It's not just \"feeling sad\". Depression can be very debilitating and can interfere with daily activities. Depression is caused by a combination of factors, such as genetics, stress, trauma, and even life transitions. It's important to know that depression is very common and can affect anyone. It's also treatable. The best thing you can do for your girlfriend is to support her in getting the help she needs. I would suggest that you talk to her about seeing a therapist. If she's not ready for that, I would suggest that you find a therapist yourself and learn more about depression. There are also some great books about depression that you can read to learn more. One that I would recommend is \"Lost Connections\" by Johann Hari. If your girlfriend is open to it, I would suggest that you attend therapy with her. It can be very helpful to have the support of loved ones during treatment. If you are not able to attend therapy with her, it's important to remember that you are not responsible for her recovery. You can support her, but you can't force her to get better. You can encourage her to get help, but you can't make her go. It's also important to remember to take care of yourself. Watching a loved one suffer from depression can be very difficult. Make sure you are taking care of your own mental and physical health. This is also something that you can talk to a therapist about.\n",

      "Hi, It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the new job and the travel that it requires. You're not alone - lots of people feel this way when they take on a new role, especially if it requires them to travel far away from home and family. It's important to remember that anxiety is actually a natural response that we all have, and it's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it's actually a great thing when it helps us to be prepared for a new challenge. When we're feeling anxious, our bodies are preparing us for action. So, if we're anxious about a new job, our body is preparing us to take on that new challenge. I think that the key here is to learn how to manage your anxiety so that it doesn't interfere with your ability to do your job. There are a lot of different strategies that you can use to do this. One of the things that you can do is to make sure that you're getting enough sleep and exercise. These are two things that can really help to reduce your anxiety. Another thing that you can do is to practice some relaxation techniques. There are lots of different ones out there, but some that you might want to try are deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and meditation. There are lots of resources out there that can help you to learn these techniques. You can also try to practice some mindfulness. This is basically just being present in the moment and not worrying about the future or dwelling on the past. You can also try to challenge your anxious thoughts. When you notice that you're having an anxious thought, try to reframe it in a more positive way. For example, instead of thinking \"I can't do this job\", you could think \"I can do this job, and I'm going to be okay\". You can also try to use positive self-talk. This is basically just talking to yourself in a positive way. For example, you could say \"I've got this\" or \"I can do this\". Another thing that you can try is to use some visualization techniques. This is basically just imagining yourself doing well in your new job. You can also try to use some distraction techniques. This is basically just doing something that you enjoy to distract yourself from your anxiety. For example, you could listen to music or read a book. I hope that some of these strategies are helpful for you. I would also encourage you to seek out some professional help if you feel like your anxiety is really interfering with your ability to do your job. A therapist can help you to develop some strategies that are specific to you and your situation.\n",

      "Hi, I can relate to what you're feeling. It's really hard to accept yourself when you don't like what you see. But, I also know that when you don't like yourself, it's because you're seeing a distorted reflection. We all have that, and it's hard to get rid of. You can, though. Here's how:1. You have to accept that you're not going to like yourself 100% of the time. It's okay to have those moments when you don't like yourself.2. When you start to have those moments, try to catch yourself and reframe it. For example, \"I'm feeling really down right now, but I know that this will pass.\"3. When you're feeling down, ask for help. You can't change your reflection all at once. You need help to change it. Ask your girlfriend, friends, or family to help you change it.4. When you're feeling good, remind yourself that you're worth it and that you're not annoying.5. Practice self-compassion. I like to use the example of a child. If your child fell down, you wouldn't say \"you're so stupid!\" You would say \"it's okay, honey. Let me help you up.\" That's how you should treat yourself. Be kind and compassionate to yourself. I hope this helps. I wish you the best of luck.\n",

However, it's great that you're already aware of the behavior and want to change it. I would suggest talking with a therapist who can help you figure out the function of the behavior (why you're doing it) and then you can come up with some alternative behaviors that serve the same purpose. For example, if you are hitting your head when you are anxious, maybe you could find another way to cope with anxiety that is less harmful, like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation. If you are hitting your head when you are frustrated, maybe you could find another way to cope with frustration, like taking a break and going to a quiet place. I would also suggest talking with your primary care physician and/or a neurologist to rule out any medical issues that may be contributing to this behavior.\n",

What is it that you are worried about? What is the worst thing that could happen? What is the best thing that could happen?

      "Hi Louisiana, You're not alone in this feeling. I've heard it from so many women, and some men too. I call it the \"Mommy Identity Crisis\". It's a time when you're feeling a bit lost and you can't remember who you were before you became a parent. It's actually a natural part of the parenting journey. You're not broken. You're not a bad mom. You just need a bit of help getting reacquainted with yourself. The first step is to accept that this is a natural part of the journey. The second step is to give yourself permission to be a \"good enough\" mom. We can't be perfect. We can't be everything to everyone. We can't be the best mom 100% of the time. We can't be the perfect wife, employee, daughter, friend, and sister. That's a lot of pressure. The third step is to give yourself time to be with yourself. This is where you start to reconnect with your identity. What do you love? What are your interests? What do you want to do? What makes you happy? What do you miss? The fourth step is to schedule in time to do these things. If you don't schedule it in, it won't happen. If you need to, you can ask for help from your partner or family. You can hire someone to help out with the housework or to watch the kids for a few hours. It's okay to ask for help. It's okay to take care of yourself. The fifth step is to find a mom tribe. There are lots of moms out there who are going through the same thing. Find a group that shares your interests and values. This is where you can find support and encouragement. The sixth step is to be patient with yourself. You won't find yourself overnight. It takes time. It takes practice. It takes effort. But it's worth it. You'll be a better mom and wife when you're happy and fulfilled. The seventh step is to remember that it's okay to be a work in progress. You don't have to have it all figured out. You don't have to be perfect. You just have to keep trying. Keep moving forward. Keep growing. Keep learning. Keep loving. Keep being. You're doing great. Keep up the good work.\n",

      "Hi, and thank you for your question. Forgiveness can be difficult. We all make mistakes, and sometimes we hurt other people when we do. In fact, we can't avoid it. It's a part of life. The good news is that forgiveness is possible. I don't know the details of what happened between you and your mom, but I imagine that it hurt you deeply. Forgiveness is about letting go of the anger, resentment, and bitterness that we feel towards someone who has hurt us. It's also about being able to move forward in the relationship and rebuild trust. Forgiveness is a process, and it can take time. It's not something that happens overnight. It's also important to note that forgiveness doesn't mean forgetting. It doesn't mean that what happened was okay. It just means that you are ready to move forward and let go of the hurt and anger. I'm not sure if you have read the book, \"The Four Agreements,\" by Don Miguel Ruiz. It's a really great book that talks about forgiveness, among other things. You may want to check it out. There are also many other books on forgiveness. I don't know if you would like to read about it, or if you would like to talk to someone about it. If you want to talk to someone, I would suggest a therapist or a counselor. They can help you to process your feelings and move through the forgiveness process. If you don't want to talk to someone, you can try writing in a journal. There are also some great online forgiveness exercises that you can try.

If you're able to, I'd suggest trying to focus on the people who are supportive of you and spend your time with them. If you're concerned about how this is impacting your relationship with your ex, you may want to consider talking to him about it. If you're not comfortable doing that, or if it doesn't help, you may want to consider talking to a therapist about it. It's also important to remember that you don't have to be friends with your ex's parents. If you're not comfortable being around them, you don't have to be. You can also choose to not talk to them about your relationship. I'm sorry you're going through this.

      "Hi! This is a very common fear that many women have. I have worked with many women to help them feel more comfortable with their bodies and to help them feel confident about their sexuality. The first step is to understand that there are many different ways to have sex and you don't have to do anything that you are not comfortable with. Your partner should be able to respect your boundaries and to not pressure you into doing anything that you don't want to do. If you are in a relationship, I would encourage you to have an open conversation with your partner about your fears. You can let him know what you are comfortable with and what you would like to try. You can also let him know what your fears are and that you would like to take things slow and to do what feels good for you. It is important to remember that you should never feel pressured to do anything that you are not comfortable with. If you are not in a relationship, I would encourage you to take things slow and to do what feels good for you. You can explore your body on your own and to learn what feels good. You can also talk to your partner about your fears and to let him know what you are comfortable with. You can also talk to your partner about what you would like to try. I hope this was helpful.\n",

      "Hello, and thank you for your question. This is a very serious situation, and you should see a counselor or therapist as soon as possible. It sounds like you are experiencing some serious symptoms of depression, anxiety, or possibly a dissociative disorder. I don't know if you have had a diagnosis from a medical professional, but if you have, it would be a good idea to share this information with a counselor. If you haven't, then seeing a counselor is still a good idea. The counselor can help you determine what is going on and how to address it. If you are not sure where to go, your primary care physician can probably help you find someone. You can also try calling your insurance company and asking for a list of counselors that they will cover. If you are a student, you can also check with your school. Most colleges and universities have counseling centers that provide free counseling to students. You can also check with your local mental health association.

      "Hello, and thank you for your question. This is a very common question that I get from people who are concerned about being gay. The short answer is that you cannot change your sexual orientation. It is not something that you can change. Now, I will say that people do sometimes \"come out\" later in life. It is not always something that you know about yourself when you are young. Sometimes people are in denial about their sexual orientation for a long time, and then they come to accept it. But, there is no way to change your sexual orientation. You mentioned that you looked at gay porn to prove that you aren't gay. I have a question for you. What are you trying to prove? Who are you trying to convince? And, why is it so important to you that you are not gay? If you are asking yourself these questions, I would suggest talking with a therapist about it. There are a lot of different things that could be going on here, and a therapist could help you sort it out. I will say that, if you are concerned about being gay, and you are worried about it, it is very important that you find a therapist who is LGBTQ affirming. If you go to a therapist who is not accepting of LGBTQ people, you could do yourself a lot of harm. There is a lot of research that shows that being LGBTQ is not a problem. It is being in a society that stigmatizes and marginalizes LGBTQ people that is the problem. So, if you go to a therapist who thinks that being gay is a problem, you could actually make yourself worse. I hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC\n",

      "Hi, I'm glad you're willing to do some work to change. I think that's a great start. I'm not sure whether you're referring to being jealous of your partner's other relationships, or being jealous of other people in general. I'll try to answer both ways. If you're referring to being jealous of your partner's other relationships, I'd ask you to consider what it is that you're jealous of. Is it the time they spend with others? Is it the closeness they feel? Is it the way they feel about others? Is it something else? Once you know what it is that you're feeling jealous of, you can work on getting that need met in your own life. If it's time, you can schedule time with your partner to focus on just you and them. If it's closeness, you can talk to your partner about what closeness means to you and what you'd like from them. If it's feeling loved, you can talk to your partner about how they show love and what you'd like from them. If you're jealous of others, I'd ask you to consider what it is that you're comparing yourself to. Are you comparing your life to someone else's highlight reel? Are you comparing your behind-the-scenes to someone else's highlight reel? If so, I'd encourage you to remember that you never really know what's going on behind the scenes for other people. If you're having a hard time figuring out what it is that you're feeling, I'd encourage you to work with a therapist to help you get a handle on what it is that you're feeling and what you need. I hope that helps. Good luck!\n",

      "Hi there, Anxiety is the body's way of telling us that we are under stress and that we need to slow down and take care of ourselves. It's the body's natural response to stress. If we don't listen to it, we can experience burnout, depression, or even physical illness. It's a message to slow down and take care of ourselves. So, the first step is to accept that anxiety is a natural response to stress and to accept that we need to take care of ourselves. The second step is to learn to recognize when we are stressed and what the signs are that we need to take care of ourselves. These can be physical, emotional, and behavioural signs. The third step is to make a self-care plan that you can follow. This can include things like meditation, yoga, exercise, healthy eating, connecting with friends and family, and many other things. The fourth step is to follow your self-care plan. This is the hard part. We know what we need to do, but we don't always do it. This is where accountability comes in. You need to find someone who will hold you accountable to your plan. This can be a friend, family member, therapist, or coach. The fifth step is to follow through with your self-care plan and make adjustments as needed. The sixth step is to celebrate your successes. This is important because it will help you to stay motivated and on track. The seventh step is to continue to monitor your anxiety and make adjustments as needed. I hope this helps. \n",

But I can help you think about it. One thing that comes to mind is the idea of \"red flags\" in relationships. These are things that are concerning and may be a sign that something bigger is going on. Things like: -Controlling behaviors-Extreme jealousy-Isolation from friends and family-Extreme mood swings-Intimidation-Intense need for attention-Substance abuse-Verbal or physical abuse-Extreme possessiveness-Extreme distrustI'm not saying that if your boyfriend has one of these characteristics that you should end the relationship. It's a spectrum. If he's just a little jealous, or a little controlling, that doesn't necessarily mean you should leave.

      "I'm sorry you are struggling to find yourself. It can be difficult to define ourselves, especially when we are in the process of growing and changing. I think it's important to remember that you don't have to have it all figured out. We are constantly changing and growing and developing new interests and passions. I think it's important to be open to that process and to embrace the idea that you can continue to grow and change. If you are struggling to find yourself, I would suggest taking some time to reflect on what you value, what you enjoy doing, and what makes you feel fulfilled. You can also try new things and see what you enjoy. You may also want to try journaling or talking with a trusted friend or family member to gain some insight into yourself.\n",

      "Hi Nashville, I love that you are aware of this problem and want to change it. I'm not sure what your relationship is with your boyfriend's friends, but it's a good idea to have some boundaries around how much of other people's lives we get involved in. You're right, though, that the way you handle anger is not helpful. When we are angry, we often say and do things that we regret later. I suggest you start by looking at the situations that make you angry. What is it that is getting under your skin? Is it that you don't like the way people talk about you? Is it that you don't like being left out of things? Once you know what it is that makes you angry, you can start to find ways to deal with that anger that don't hurt other people. For example, if you're angry because you don't like being left out of things, you can talk to your boyfriend about that. You can also talk to your friends about what you like and don't like. I'm not suggesting that you start telling them how to talk to each other, but you can tell them that you don't like being talked about, and that you'd prefer that they talk to you directly. If you're angry because you don't like the way people talk about you, you can tell them that. Another thing you can do is talk to your boyfriend about your anger issues. You can let him know that you are trying to work on them, and that you want to be better. You can also let him know that you don't want to hurt him, and that you are trying to be better for him too. If you're feeling really overwhelmed, you can also talk to a therapist about your anger issues. They can help you to find ways to deal with your anger that don't hurt other people.\n",
