"We weren't long distance until he joined the military.  I love him and I know he loves, me but it's complicated. He said he's not going to find someone else, but I'm afraid. How do I keep our relationship going?","You're wise to be aware of possible changes to your relationship once your bf is away from you for extended time periods.All you both can do is state your intentions and wishes, keep in contact as much as possible, and wait to see how your relationship unfolds.To a large degree, each of you is relying on faith that if the relationship is meant to last for a while, then it will.   The military may add stress.This doesn't necessarily mean the stress will dissolve the relationship.Sometimes all anyone is able to do, is try.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, but a *very* common one for people with partners in the military. It's good you recognize the love is there on both sides, but the ""complicated"" part and your fears are totally valid. Here's a breakdown of how to navigate this, combining practical advice with emotional support. I'll break it down into sections: Communication, Building Trust (Especially with His Statement), Managing Your Fears, Self-Care, and Long-Term Expectations.  It's long, but this is a complex situation!

**1. Communication: The Lifeline**

*   **Scheduled Check-ins:** This is *huge*.  Military life is unpredictable.  You can't just rely on spontaneous calls. Agree on a realistic schedule for communication. This could be:
    *   **Daily Texts/Messages:** Even a quick ""Thinking of you"" goes a long way.
    *   **Regular Video Calls:**  This is the gold standard.  Seeing each other's faces makes a massive difference.  Factor in time zone differences!  Be flexible, but aim for consistency.
    *   **""Mail Call"":**  Old-fashioned letters and care packages are incredibly meaningful.  A tangible piece of home.
*   **Be Realistic About Availability:** Understand he will have times when he *cannot* communicate – training, deployments, missions. Don't take it personally (easier said than done, I know!).  Knowing this upfront helps.
*   **Deep Talks *When* You Can:** When you *do* have dedicated time, don't just stick to surface-level updates. Talk about your feelings, your dreams, your fears.  Share your day, the good and the bad.
*   **Be Open and Honest:**  Tell him about your fears.  Don't bottle things up.  ""I'm feeling anxious when I don't hear from you for a while"" is a valid statement.
*   **Active Listening:** When he *is* talking, truly listen.  Military life can be stressful and he may need to vent. Be a supportive ear.



**2. Building Trust (Around His ""Not Going To Find Someone Else"" Statement)**

This is where it gets tricky. His statement is reassuring, but your fear is still valid.  Here's how to unpack this:

*   **Acknowledge the Statement, But Don't Rely Solely On It:** ""Thank you for telling me that. It means a lot to hear you say that you're committed to us. I still have moments of worry, and I'd like to talk about what makes those come up.""  This acknowledges his feelings *and* validates yours.
*   **Ask *Why* He Said It:** Not in an accusatory way, but with genuine curiosity. ""What makes you so sure about that?""  His answer will tell you a lot about his reasoning and commitment. Is it based on a deep connection with you? His values?  His understanding of the challenges of maintaining a relationship while deployed?
*   **Focus on Actions, Not Just Words:**  His behavior will ultimately be more telling than his words. Does he prioritize you when he can?  Does he include you in his future plans (even vague ones)? Is he respectful of your feelings?
*   **Understand the Military Culture (A Bit):** The military emphasizes loyalty and commitment. It's not to say people *never* have affairs, but the culture generally discourages it. Understanding this context can provide some reassurance, but *never* at the expense of your own feelings.
*   **Trust Needs To Be Earned & Re-Earned:** Even *before* the military, trust is built over time. Long distance adds layers. Every time he follows through on a promise to communicate, every time he makes you feel valued despite the distance, he's building trust.

**3. Managing Your Fears**

Your fear is completely understandable. Here are some strategies:

*   **Identify the Root of Your Fear:** What *specifically* are you afraid of?  Is it that he'll meet someone else? That he'll change? That the distance will erode your connection?  Pinpointing the fear makes it easier to address.
*   **Challenge Negative Thoughts:** When you start spiraling, ask yourself: ""Is this thought based on facts, or on my anxiety?"" ""Is there another way to look at this situation?""
*   **Focus on What You *Can* Control:** You can't control his actions, but you *can* control your own. You can control how you spend your time, how you nurture yourself, and how you communicate.
*   **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be incredibly cathartic.
*   **Distraction (Healthy Distraction):**  When anxiety"
"I have no real friends. I have a girlfriend who irritates me but loves me to death. I push her away and pushes me away. We’re going through a breakup, and I have nobody.","Having time all to yourself may be necessary so you have time to reflect on your own identity and values, become more clear on what matters most to you, and with this increased self-understanding, be able to attract people who will feel like satisfying friends.Having a relationship with someone whom you push away and are pushed away, with someone who is irritating, seems to have limited benefit for each of you.Maybe you are together from fear of being alone, and being alone is exactly what you may now need in your life in order to draw more favorable people to you.","Okay, that sounds incredibly tough. It's a really painful situation to be in – ending a relationship *and* feeling like you have no solid support system. It's understandable you're feeling lost and probably quite lonely right now. It takes courage to even acknowledge that, so good on you for doing that. Let's break this down and think about some things.  I'll try to offer some support and potential paths forward.  This will be a longer response, because it's a complex situation.

**First, validating your feelings:**

* **It's okay to grieve:** Even if the relationship was frustrating and you were pushing each other away, it's still a loss. Grief isn't just for ""good"" breakups.  You're losing a companion, a routine, someone you shared your life with, and a potential future. Allow yourself to feel sad, angry, confused, or whatever comes up. Don't judge your emotions.
* **It's okay to feel scared:** Facing this alone is terrifying.  It's a very natural reaction to feel anxious about the future when your support network feels nonexistent.
* **It's okay to admit it's hard:** You *are* in a hard place.  Don't try to minimize it or pretend you're fine if you're not.



**Let's look at the different parts of this:**

**1. The Breakup & Your Girlfriend:**

* **The Push-Pull Dynamic:** You describe a pattern of pushing and pulling.  That kind of dynamic is exhausting and rarely leads to lasting happiness. It's good you're recognizing this. It often stems from deeper issues – perhaps fear of intimacy, differing needs, or unresolved conflicts.
* **The Irritation:** You mention she irritates you.  That's important information.  It's okay to not be compatible with someone, even if they love you.  Staying in a relationship where you feel consistently irritated will likely lead to resentment and unhappiness for both of you.  
* **Focus on *your* needs:** During the breakup, try to communicate (if you can, and if it's safe and productive) your needs and why the relationship isn’t working for *you*.  Avoid getting caught in blame.  ""I feel..."" statements are helpful. (e.g., ""I feel drained when..."" instead of ""You always..."")  Even if she's upset, clarity is kinder in the long run.
* **Space is crucial:**  After a breakup, especially one with a lot of emotional entanglement, you *both* need space to heal. This means limiting contact, even if she's reaching out.  It’s important for both of you to establish independence and learn to be okay on your own.



**2. The Lack of Friends:**

This is the bigger, underlying issue, and the one that's causing the most anxiety right now. This is where we need to focus our energy.  Here's a breakdown of why this happens and what you can do:

* **Why it happens:** There are many reasons why people end up without close friends. Some common ones:
    * **Life changes:** Moving, new jobs, starting relationships (ironically, sometimes relationships can unintentionally overshadow friendships).
    * **Shyness/Social Anxiety:**  It can be hard to put yourself out there.
    * **Past experiences:**  Negative experiences with friendships can make you hesitant to form new ones.
    * **Focus on other priorities:**  Work, hobbies, or other commitments can take up a lot of time and energy.
    * **Difficulty with vulnerability:**  It can be hard to open up and let people get to know the real you.
* **Building a Support System – it takes effort:** This won't happen overnight, and it requires consistent effort.  Here's a plan of action:
    * **Identify your interests:** What do you genuinely enjoy doing?  This is the key to finding people you'll connect with.  Think beyond surface-level things. What values are important to you?  What topics do you love discussing?
    * **Join groups/activities:**  This is *the* most effective way to meet people.  Think about:
        * **Hobbies:**  Book clubs, hiking groups, gaming communities, art classes, sports teams, cooking classes, photography clubs.
        * **Volunteer organizations:**  A great way to meet people who share your values and make a difference.
        * **Classes:**  Learn a new skill and meet classmates.
        * **Meetup.com:**  A website specifically for finding local groups based on interests.
        * **Local events:** Check community calendars for festivals, concerts, workshops, etc.
    * **Start small:** Don't try to become best friends with"
I feel like my time is going too fast,"Thank you for reaching out! That is a great question! As an American, I can truly say that I spend way too much time on the go! It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe! I often ask myself, what if I only had one day left on this Earth? What would I do? Well, that is an easy question. I would spend it with my family! Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World, right? Its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring.Time management is a very important factor when learning to ""live life to the fullest""! In fact, this is a required course in undergraduate college now. Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this. Personally, for myself I like to keep a calendar with a to-do list. I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list. That way, if I do not get through the list, I am not stressing over the little things. When planning your day, it is important you schedule work, eat and play. A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. There is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this, then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse/partner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there. Again, everyone has their own style on time management. I hope this was helpful for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out for anything further!","Okay, you're definitely not alone in feeling that way! It's a *very* common feeling, especially as we get older. It's like time speeds up as we go. Let's break down why you might be feeling this and, more importantly, what you can *do* about it.  I'll try to be thorough, so this might be a bit long, but hopefully helpful.  I'll categorize it into sections: **Why it feels this way, what you can do to *feel* like you have more time, and what you can do to *make* the time you have more meaningful.**

**1. Why Does Time Feel Like It's Speeding Up?**

* **The ""Proportion Theory"":** This is a popular idea. When you're young, a year is a huge chunk of your life. If you're 5, a year is 20% of your entire existence!  But when you're 50, a year is only 2%.  Each year feels smaller in proportion to the total life you've lived.
* **Habit & Routine:**  The more routine your life, the less your brain registers distinct memories.  Novel experiences create stronger memories, which help us feel like time has *passed*.  When days blend together, it feels like time has flown.
* **Focus on the Future:**  Constantly thinking about what's *next* (deadlines, appointments, goals) pulls you out of the present moment.  You're not fully experiencing what's happening *right now*.
* **Information Overload:** We're bombarded with information these days. This can lead to a sense of overwhelm and make it harder to process and remember experiences, contributing to the feeling of time slipping away.
* **Aging & Cognitive Changes:** As we age, our brains process information slightly differently, which can affect our perception of time.
* **Stress & Anxiety:**  When you're stressed or anxious, your perception of time can be distorted.  It can feel like everything is happening too quickly.



**2.  How to *Feel* Like You Have More Time (Small Shifts in Perspective)**

These are about changing your *perception*, not necessarily adding hours to the day.

* **Mindfulness & Being Present:** This is huge.  Even 5-10 minutes of daily mindfulness practice (meditation, deep breathing, focusing on your senses) can make a difference.  Apps like Headspace, Calm, or Insight Timer can help.  *Really* savor your coffee in the morning. *Really* listen when someone is talking to you.
* **Single-Tasking:**  Stop multitasking! It's a myth.  It actually makes you less efficient and more stressed.  Focus on one thing at a time, and give it your full attention.  
* **Disconnect to Reconnect:**  Schedule regular breaks from technology – phone, computer, TV.  Even 30 minutes a day can help you feel more grounded.
* **Time Blocking:**  Instead of just having a to-do list, schedule specific blocks of time for specific tasks.  This gives you a visual representation of how your time is being spent.
* **Keep a ""Done"" List:**  Instead of just focusing on what you *haven't* done, write down what you *have* accomplished.  It's a great way to see how much you're actually getting done.
* **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and experiences can help you process them and create stronger memories.
* **Gratitude Practice:**  Taking a few minutes each day to reflect on things you're grateful for can shift your focus to the positive and make you feel more content with the present moment.

**3.  How to *Make* the Time You Have More Meaningful (Big Picture Changes)**

These are about changing *how* you spend your time.

* **Prioritize:** What truly matters to you?  What are your values?  Make sure your activities align with those values.  Say ""no"" to things that don't. This is hard, but crucial.
* **Set Realistic Goals:**  Don't try to do too much.  Break down large goals into smaller, more manageable steps.
* **Schedule ""Me Time"":**  This is non-negotiable.  Time for hobbies, relaxation, and activities that bring you joy.  It's not selfish; it's essential for your well-being.
* **Cultivate Relationships:**  Spend quality time with the people you care about.  Strong relationships are a major source of happiness and fulfillment.
* **Learn Something New:**  Challenge yourself mentally.  Take a class, read a book, learn a new skill.  This keeps your brain engaged and creates new memories.

"He wants to wear makeup and heels. He even tucks his penis away to resemble a vagina. He wants me to wear a strap on and have anal sex with him. I have tried this for him, but I don’t like it and have told him so. He keeps making comments about it and says he can't live without it.","It sounds like you may be asking two different questions.With regard to what you said about your husband dressing as a female in your bedroom, I wonder if you would consider asking him more about this. If you choose to do that, I would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience. This can be difficult to do at times, particularly when you may want to offer your own opinions or become very anxious or of type. Consider thinking of a phrase that may help you to stay calm during the discussion. It may be helpful to think of yourself as asking questions as if you were an investigative reporter and using questions that start with words like ""what, how, who, where, when."" Questions that start with ""why,"" can be very difficult to answer for some people and can be overwhelming because it often links to answers involving emotions that may or may not be understood. Also try restating what your husband is saying to make sure that you are understanding correctly. If what he is telling you is different than what you have heard or thought of for many years, it may be challenging to follow his meaning initially. Remember that listening to your husband does not imply agreement with what he is saying, just that you are following and looking to understand what he is experiencing. I also recommend sticking to one topic for the conversation, but this could be done with many different topics over time.You could also see if he would be willing to have a discussion where he listens like an investigative reporter to learn more about the experience that you are having.As far as what you mentioned about the sexual experience, maybe if you can discuss what it is that you don't like and/or understand what it is that he does like, you could see if there is some middle ground here. It depends on what you both prefer.These types of conversations can be difficult to have for some couples, at least initially. Having structured conversations, such as the ones I've described briefly above, can feel awkward initially, but the reason it can be helpful is because it can lead to further understanding in a way that decreases the chances of having an argument.Also consider seeing a therapist in your area who specializes in couples to discuss some of these ideas.","Okay, this is a complex situation with a lot to unpack. It sounds like you're in a difficult position, feeling pressured and uncomfortable, and it's good you're reaching out. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, why it's concerning, and what you can do, focusing on your well-being and safety.  I will cover this in sections: Understanding the Situation, Your Feelings & Boundaries, His Behavior, and Seeking Help & Resources.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end as this is not a substitute for professional advice.**

**1. Understanding the Situation**

* **Gender Expression vs. Sexual Preference:**  His desire to wear makeup, heels, and tuck his genitals suggests exploration of gender expression. This is a personal journey and perfectly valid. *However*, it doesn't automatically dictate his sexual preferences, and importantly, *it does not give him the right to pressure you into sexual acts you are not comfortable with.*  It's possible he's exploring his sexuality in conjunction with his gender expression, but these are separate things.
* **Fetish & Compulsion:** His insistence that he ""can't live without"" the specific act you've tried (strap-on/anal sex) is a significant red flag. It suggests this has become a compulsion for him, potentially a fetish that is controlling his behavior.  While having a fetish isn’t inherently wrong, *demanding* its fulfillment from a partner, especially after you've clearly expressed discomfort, *is* problematic.
* **Power Dynamics & Coercion:** The repeated comments and dismissal of your boundaries are a form of emotional coercion. He’s not respecting your “no,” and is trying to manipulate you into doing something you don’t want to do.  This creates an unhealthy power imbalance in the relationship.



**2. Your Feelings & Boundaries**

* **Your Feelings are Valid:** You have *every right* to not enjoy a sexual act.  Your body, your pleasure, your comfort – these are non-negotiable.  You've already done the right thing by trying it to please him *and* by communicating that you don't like it.
* **""No"" Means No:**  His continued pressure *after* you've said no is unacceptable.  You are not obligated to engage in any sexual activity you don’t want to, regardless of his feelings or how he frames them.  A healthy partner respects boundaries.
* **Prioritize Your Well-being:** You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel safe, respected, and comfortable expressing your needs and boundaries without fear of pressure or manipulation.  His behavior is harming your well-being.
* **Identify Your Limits:**  Be clear with yourself about what you *are* and *are not* willing to do.  Write it down if it helps.  This will make it easier to reinforce your boundaries.

**3. His Behavior - Red Flags & Concerns**

* **Disregard for Your Boundaries:** This is the biggest and most concerning issue.  Repeatedly pushing boundaries after a clear ""no"" is a form of abuse.
* **Emotional Manipulation:**  Saying he ""can't live without it"" is a manipulative tactic designed to guilt you into compliance.  It's a way of making your refusal feel like a personal failing or a threat to his well-being.
* **Potential Underlying Issues:**  His intense fixation on this specific act could indicate deeper psychological issues that he needs to address.  This doesn't excuse his behavior, but it suggests he may need professional help.
* **Controlling Behavior:**  The persistent comments and attempts to influence your sexual choices are indicative of controlling behavior.  This can escalate over time.



**4. Seeking Help & Resources**

* **Individual Therapy:**  *You* would benefit from talking to a therapist. A therapist can help you process your feelings, reinforce your boundaries, develop coping mechanisms, and assess the health of the relationship.  They can also help you recognize manipulative tactics and build your self-esteem.
* **Couple's Therapy (with caution):**  *Only* consider couples therapy if he acknowledges his behavior is problematic and is willing to take responsibility and work on changing it.  If he's unwilling to admit there's a problem or continues to pressure you, couples therapy could be harmful, as it could reinforce the power imbalance.
* **Support Groups:**  Connecting with others who have experienced similar situations can be incredibly validating and empowering.
* **Hotlines/Resources:**
    * **RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network):** 1-800-656-HOPE  https://www.rainn.org  (Even if this doesn't involve physical assault, they can provide support and guidance regarding coercion and unhealthy relationship dynamics.)

"I am a really shy person. I'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?","First of all, way to go in stretching yourself out of your comfort zone! You are sure to grow through all of this practice presenting to your peers, and that in itself will help to grow your confidence over time. In the meantime, do whatever you can to help yourself feel prepared for each presentation. Do your work ahead of time so that you feel well-informed on your topic, and then spend the days leading up to your presentation practicing. Do your presentation in the mirror, while you are driving (if it won't distract you from the road), and practice in front of a friend. On the day of the presentation, eat a balanced meal, get a pep talk from a supportive friend, use deep breathing to keep your body calm, and remind yourself that you are prepared. You got this!","Okay, it's *totally* understandable that presentations are tough when you're naturally shy, especially in a demanding grad program. It's great that you're recognizing this and actively wanting to build your confidence. It's not a quick fix, but absolutely achievable with consistent effort. Here's a breakdown of strategies, broken down into preparation, during the presentation, and long-term confidence building.  I'll also categorize things by how much effort/time they take.  I'll try to give you a lot of options so you can find what resonates with you.

**I. Preparation is Key (High Effort, High Reward)**

This is where you'll get the biggest bang for your buck.  The more prepared you are, the less anxiety you'll feel.

*   **Over-Prepare (Seriously):** This is your best friend.  Don't just know your material; *master* it.  
    *   **Outline Thoroughly:**  A really solid outline is a lifeline.  Don't write out full sentences (that encourages reading), but detailed bullet points.
    *   **Practice, Practice, Practice:**  And then practice some more.  Don't just rehearse in your head. 
        *   **Alone:** Start by practicing aloud to yourself.  Focus on clarity and flow.
        *   **Mirror:**  Record yourself (video is best!) and watch it back.  It's painful, but invaluable for noticing filler words (""um,"" ""like""), body language, and pacing.
        *   **Friends/Family:** Present to people you trust. Ask for constructive feedback - specifically ask them to point out things you do that *don't* sound natural.  Don't be defensive!
        *   **Practice in the Actual Room:**  If possible, practice *in* the room where you'll be presenting.  Get comfortable with the space, the projector, the lighting.
    *   **Anticipate Questions:**  Brainstorm potential questions your audience might ask.  Prepare concise answers.  It’s okay to say “That’s a great question, let me think about that for a moment” or “I don’t have that information immediately available, but I can find out for you.”
*   **Structure for Comfort:**
    *   **Start Strong:**  Prepare a killer opening.  A captivating story, a surprising statistic, a thought-provoking question – something to grab attention. Knowing you have a strong start can ease initial anxiety.
    *   **Clear Transitions:** Use signposting language (""Now let's move on to…"", ""In contrast to…"") to help both you and the audience follow your logic. This helps *you* stay on track.
    *   **End with a Bang:** Prepare a memorable conclusion. Summarize key points and leave a lasting impression.
*   **Visualize Success:**  Before the presentation, spend time visualizing yourself delivering a confident, engaging presentation.  Imagine the audience reacting positively.  This isn't about unrealistic fantasy, but about priming your brain for a positive experience.
*   **Chunk It Down:** If the presentation is long, break it into smaller, manageable sections. Focus on mastering one section at a time.



**II. During the Presentation (Medium Effort, Medium Reward)**

These are strategies for managing anxiety *in the moment*.

*   **Deep Breathing:**  Before you start, and even during pauses, practice deep, slow breathing.  (Box breathing - inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4 - is a good technique.)  This physiologically calms your nervous system.
*   **Grounding Techniques:**  If you feel overwhelmed, subtly ground yourself:
    *   **Feel Your Feet:**  Focus on the sensation of your feet on the floor.
    *   **Hand Clasp:** Gently clasp your hands together.
    *   **Object Focus:**  Choose a neutral object in the room and focus on it for a few seconds.
*   **Slow Down:**  Shyness often leads to rushing.  Consciously slow your pace.  Pauses are your friend!  They give you time to think and the audience time to process.
*   **Eye Contact (Strategic):** You don't need to stare intently at everyone.  
    *   **Friendly Faces:**  Identify a few friendly faces in the audience and make brief eye contact with them.
    *   **Scan the Room:**  Periodically scan the room, but don’t linger too long on any one person.  Looking *above* people's heads can also create the *illusion* of eye contact if direct eye contact is too much.
*   **Embrace Imperfection:**  You *will* stumble. You *will* misspeak."
"I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental.
   I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?","It is very good news that you realize the risks of smoking cigarettes while pregnant and are willing to stop.Thinking about smoking is a typical and frequent reaction to being without the substance.Be creative with what you know about yourself to distract you when this psychological urge comes up.  My suggestions are to imagine smoking if you find this would relieve the sense of wanting to smoke.Or, do the opposite and remind yourself of all the good reasons to not smoke.Also, since you're planning pregnancy then ask your partner for ideas on how to make the psychological feeling to want to smoke, feel less intense.Another suggestion is that your partner is your texting buddy to stop smoking.   With AA groups, a sponsor is always available for the alcoholic who feels distress about the urge to drink.   Having a trusted and caring person to tell about your problem helps in many situations.  Maybe it will help you to stop smoking.Good luck!","Okay, congratulations on deciding to quit for your future baby! That's a *huge* and incredibly important step, and acknowledging it's hard is also really important. You're right to identify that a lot of it is mental - that's incredibly common.  It's fantastic you're proactively looking for strategies. Here's a breakdown of approaches, focusing on the mental side, and combining them with addressing the physical.  I'll categorize them for clarity, and *please read the disclaimer at the end* as I'm not a medical professional.

**1. Understanding the Mental Addiction (and Being Kind to Yourself)**

* **Recognize the Triggers:** This is *key*.  What situations, feelings, or times of day make you *think* about smoking? Is it after a meal? When stressed? When bored? While drinking coffee?  When with certain people?  Write these down.  Once you know your triggers, you can prepare.
* **Challenge Your Thoughts:** When you have the thought of smoking, don't just automatically act on it.  Pause.  Ask yourself:
    * ""Is this thought helpful?"" (No!)
    * ""Is this thought realistic?"" (You're choosing to be smoke-free for your baby!)
    * ""What's the *real* benefit of smoking in this moment?"" (Often, it's fleeting relief from discomfort, which can be achieved in other ways - see below)
    * ""What would I tell a friend who was having this thought?"" (Often, we're much kinder to others than ourselves).
* **Reframe Your Thinking:**  Instead of thinking ""I *can't* have a cigarette,"" try ""I *choose* not to have a cigarette.""  It's a subtle shift, but it puts you in control.  Focus on what you *gain* by not smoking (health for you and baby, financial savings, feeling proud of yourself) instead of what you're ""giving up"".
* **Self-Compassion:**  You *will* have moments of intense craving.  Don't beat yourself up over them.  Acknowledge the craving (""Okay, I'm having a strong urge right now""), remind yourself why you're quitting, and then focus on a coping strategy (see below).  Relapses happen, and it doesn't mean you've failed. It's a bump in the road.



**2.  Breaking the Mental Habits & Distraction Techniques**

* **The 4 D's:** This is a classic:
    * **Delay:**  Tell yourself you'll wait 10 minutes.  Often, the urge will lessen.  Keep adding 10 minutes.
    * **Deep Breathe:**  Practice deep, slow breaths.  This calms your nervous system. (Inhale slowly through your nose, hold for a few seconds, exhale slowly through your mouth).
    * **Drink Water:**  Sip water slowly. It occupies your mouth and hands and can help with cravings.
    * **Do Something Else (Distract):**  This is huge.  And needs to be *planned*.  Have a list of go-to distractions ready:
        * **Physical Activity:** A quick walk, stretching, dancing to music.
        * **Hobbies:** Reading, knitting, drawing, playing an instrument.
        * **Social Interaction:** Call a friend, talk to your partner, play with a pet.
        * **Mindful Activities:**  Meditation (even a 5-minute guided meditation), listening to music, taking a bath.
* **Change Your Routine:**  If you always smoke with coffee, switch to tea. If you smoke after meals, get up and wash dishes immediately. Disrupt the associations.
* **Visual Reminders:**  Put pictures of your future baby in places you see often.  Write down reasons why you're quitting and keep them visible.
* **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  Learning to be present in the moment can help you observe cravings without acting on them. There are tons of free guided meditation apps (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer).
* **Journaling:** Write down your thoughts and feelings. This can help you process them and identify patterns.



**3. Addressing the Physical Addiction (Important to do *alongside* the mental strategies)**

* **Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT):**  Talk to your doctor about patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, or nasal spray.  These can help reduce withdrawal symptoms, making it easier to focus on the mental aspects.  *Crucially, discuss the safety of NRT during pregnancy with your doctor.*
* **Prescription Medications:**  Your doctor might recommend medications like bupropion (Zyban) or varenicline (Chantix). *These are generally not"
"I found the guy I’m dating on dating websites. He was telling women that they were beautiful. He said it wasn’t him and that the phone was hacked. It has since happened two other times. He says he loves me and I’m the only girl he wants to be with, but I feel he is not telling me the truth.","I would suggest possibly talking about the type of relationship that both of you want to create. For example, you may want a relationship where honesty, listening, compassion, and romanticism are major parts. You could also see what your boyfriend wants.You may also consider taking five minutes to see if he will listen to your feelings about him being on the dating site and whether he can work to learn more about what you are experiencing with asking open-ended questions (not being answered with yes or no) and restating what you are saying to see if he has it right. After that, perhaps you could switch so that you can listen to his perspective for five minutes and learn more about what he is doing by asking open-ended questions.Remember that it takes two people to have  a relationship, so the choice is yours as to whether you choose to stay in the relationship and what kind of relationship you would like to have.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and your feelings of distrust are *completely* valid. This is a major red flag and it's good you're recognizing that. Let's break down why this is concerning and what you can consider doing.

**Why This Is Concerning (and why ""hacked"" doesn't hold water):**

* **Pattern, Not a One-Off:** The ""hacked"" excuse once *might* be believable, but happening *three* times is incredibly suspicious.  It's statistically improbable to have your account repeatedly compromised in that way, especially with the security measures most dating platforms have.
* **The Nature of the Action:**  Actively telling other women they are beautiful isn't something a random hacker would typically do. It's a deliberate action. A hacker might try to steal information or money, but not engage in flirtatious messaging.
* **Gaslighting Potential:**  Even if he *believes* it wasn't him, repeatedly blaming hacking instead of taking responsibility or investigating the issue further can be a form of gaslighting. He's attempting to control the narrative and dismiss your valid concerns.
* **Broken Trust:** Trust is the foundation of any relationship.  He has broken your trust repeatedly, and simply saying ""I love you"" doesn't magically fix that.  Words need to be backed up by actions.
* **Disrespectful:** Even *if* he's being ""hacked"" (highly unlikely), the fact that he isn't actively prioritizing securing his accounts and addressing the issue to protect *your* feelings is disrespectful.



**What You Should Consider Doing:**

1. **Direct, Specific Confrontation:**  You've likely already done this, but you need to have *another* conversation. This time, be very direct and specific.  Don't let him deflect.
   * **Example:**  ""This has happened three times now, and I need to understand what's going on. The 'hacked' excuse doesn't feel truthful to me, and it's deeply hurting my trust. I need you to explain, honestly, what is happening.  I'm not asking if you *intend* to do this, I'm asking what is *actually* happening.  Are you sure your account is secure? Have you changed your password? Have you reported these incidents to the dating site?""
   * **Important:** Focus on your *feelings* and the *impact* of his actions, not just accusations. ""I feel hurt and disrespected when this happens,"" is more effective than ""You're a liar.""

2. **Ask for Proof (and Evaluate It):**
   * **Ask him to show you his account settings:**  Request he show you security settings, last login activity (if the site allows), and any steps he’s taken to secure his account (two-factor authentication, new password, etc.).
   * **Be skeptical:** Even if he shows you something, consider if it’s easily faked.  

3. **Set Clear Boundaries & Consequences:**
   * **""If this happens again, I will need to re-evaluate this relationship.""** This is crucial. He needs to understand that his actions have consequences.
   * **Don't accept ""I'm sorry"" without concrete action.**  An apology is meaningless if he doesn't address the underlying issue.
   * **Decide what you are willing to tolerate.**  Are you willing to give him another chance if he takes demonstrable steps to fix the problem? Or is this a deal-breaker?

4. **Trust Your Gut:**  You said you feel he's not telling the truth. *That feeling is important.*  Don't dismiss it. Your intuition is often right.  If something feels off, it probably is.

5. **Consider His Response:** How does he react when you confront him?
   * **Defensive and dismissive:** This is a very bad sign. He's prioritizing avoiding accountability over addressing your concerns.
   * **Open and willing to work on it:**  This is a better sign, *but* it needs to be followed by actual action.
   * **Emotional manipulation:**  Does he try to turn it around on you, make you feel crazy for questioning him, or guilt-trip you?  This is a huge red flag.

6. **Take a Break/Space:** Sometimes, creating distance can give you clarity. It allows you to assess the situation without being emotionally invested in the moment.

7. **Protect Yourself:** Don’t share sensitive information with him until you have resolved this.

**Important Reminders:**

* **You deserve honesty and respect.**  A partner who values you will not repeatedly make you question their integrity.
* **You are not responsible for his actions.** You're not"
"After I told them, they yelled at me.","It's most important that you accept yourself and surround yourself with a group of friends who are kind to you and love you. Family hearing news of any kind for the first time if they are an anxious type of character, will always be tough to digest. Time is important to let it all settle in and also making sure you're taking good care of yourself... I think you're brave and I give you a lot of credit for not denying who you are -- you will inspire so many people to do the same in your life. Wishing you all the best. Gina","Okay, that sounds really upsetting. It's awful to be yelled at, especially *after* you were brave enough to tell someone something. Here's a breakdown of how to process this, and some things to consider, broken down into sections.  I'll cover feelings, what might be happening, and what you can do.  This is a long response, because this situation deserves a thorough look.  **Please read the section at the very end about getting help if you feel unsafe.**

**1. Acknowledging Your Feelings:**

First and foremost, it's *okay* to feel however you're feeling right now. Some common reactions to being yelled at after sharing something vulnerable are:

* **Hurt:**  It's incredibly painful when someone responds to your honesty with anger.
* **Scared:**  Being yelled at can be frightening, even if you weren't physically threatened.
* **Confused:** You might be wondering *why* they reacted that way.
* **Angry:** You have every right to be angry that they didn't handle your sharing with respect.
* **Sad:**  You might feel let down, disappointed, or grieve the loss of trust.
* **Ashamed/Guilty (and you shouldn't be):**  *They* behaved badly, not you.  Do not blame yourself for their reaction.
* **Shut down/Numb:** Sometimes, as a protective mechanism, we disconnect from our feelings.

**Don't dismiss your feelings. They are valid.**  Let yourself feel them without judgment.



**2. Understanding What Might Have Happened (Why They Yelled):**

There are many reasons why someone might yell, and *none of them excuse their behavior*, but understanding the potential reasons can help you process it.  Here are some possibilities:

* **They were caught off guard:**  What you told them might have been something they didn't expect or weren't prepared to hear.  This doesn't justify yelling, but it can explain a momentary loss of control.
* **They are dealing with their own issues:**  Sometimes people lash out when they're stressed, overwhelmed, or struggling with their own problems.  Again, this isn't an excuse, but it can offer some context.
* **They have poor communication skills:** Some people haven't learned healthy ways to express their emotions or handle difficult conversations.  They may resort to yelling because they don't know how else to cope.
* **They felt defensive:**  They may have felt blamed or attacked by what you said, even if that wasn't your intention.
* **They are controlling or abusive:** This is a *very serious* possibility. If this is a pattern of behavior, where they regularly yell at you, try to control you, or make you feel afraid, it's a sign of an unhealthy and potentially dangerous relationship (see the ""Safety"" section at the end).
* **They disagreed with what you said:** While disagreement is normal, yelling is *not* an acceptable way to express it.
* **They were trying to intimidate you:**  Yelling can be used as a tactic to silence or control someone.



**3. What You Can Do Now:**

* **Take Space:**  You need time to process what happened.  Physically remove yourself from the situation if possible.  Even a few minutes of quiet can help.
* **Don't Engage When They're Yelling:**  Trying to reason with someone who is yelling is usually unproductive. It often escalates the situation.  It's okay to say something like, ""I'm not going to continue this conversation while you're yelling,"" and then walk away.
* **Consider Whether You Want to Continue the Conversation (and When):**  After things have calmed down, *if you feel safe and comfortable*, you *might* consider talking to them again.  But you are not obligated to.
* **If You Choose to Talk, Set Boundaries:**  If you decide to talk, be clear about what you need from them. For example:
    * ""I want to talk about this, but I need you to speak to me respectfully.""
    * ""I'm willing to discuss this, but I won't tolerate being yelled at.""
    * ""I need you to listen to what I have to say without interrupting.""
* **Focus on ""I"" Statements:**  When you talk, express your feelings using ""I"" statements.  For example, instead of saying ""You made me feel bad when you yelled,"" say ""I felt hurt and scared when I was yelled at.""
* **Accept That You Can't Control Their Reaction:**  You can only control your own behavior. You can't force someone to respond in a way that you want them to.
* **Journaling:** Writing down"
"I’ve been on 0.5 mg of Xanax twice a day for the past month. It hasn't been helping me at all, but when I take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack, it calms me down. I was wondering how I can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking I'm abusing them. I just have very big anxiety attacks. Should I stay on the 0.5mg and deal with the attacks or should I ask to up the dose? I'm afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else.","Do you think you're abusing xanax?It is a highly addictive drug so maybe one reason you feel compelled to take more is bc you already are addicted.Drugs don't do anything helpful in solving life's problems.   Once the effect wears off, the stressful situation is once again waiting for you to address it.Think over your reason for not directly asking your psychologist about upping your dose.Also, do you ever talk about your life problems with this psychologist or only your need for drugs?    The more gradual path to a better life is to not need drugs in the first place. This consists of your willingness to face the matters that are creating such terrible feelings inside you.","Okay, this is a really valid concern, and it's good you're thinking through this carefully. You're right to be worried about how your psychologist might perceive your request, given the sensitivities around benzodiazepines like Xanax. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering what to say, what to emphasize, and how to prepare for different responses.  I will also add a *very important disclaimer* at the end.

**Understanding the Situation**

* **Xanax & Tolerance:** Your experience is common.  Xanax can build tolerance quickly, meaning the same dose becomes less effective over time.  That's why 0.5mg twice a day might not be cutting it anymore, but 1mg *during* an attack still works.  This suggests it's still having an effect, just not consistently at the lower dose.
* **Psychologist's Concerns:** Your psychologist's primary concern is likely twofold:
    * **Dependence/Abuse:** Benzodiazepines are addictive, and doctors are very careful about prescribing them long-term. They'll want to avoid a situation where the dose keeps creeping up.
    * **Underlying Issues:** They want to address the *cause* of your anxiety, not just mask the symptoms with medication.  Medication is often seen as a temporary tool *while* you work on therapy to develop coping mechanisms.
* **Your Needs:** You're experiencing significant anxiety attacks that are impacting your life, and you've found that a higher dose provides relief *when* they happen.  This is important information.



**How to Talk to Your Psychologist - A Script/Framework**

Here's a way to structure the conversation, focusing on honesty and collaboration:

1. **Start by Reaffirming Your Commitment to Therapy:**  ""I'm continuing to find our therapy sessions really helpful, and I'm committed to working on the underlying causes of my anxiety.  I'm actively using the techniques we've discussed [mention a specific technique or two, even if it's just noticing your anxiety], and I want to continue doing that.""  *This immediately shows you're not just seeking a quick fix.*

2. **Describe Your Experience Clearly and Specifically:**  ""Over the past month on 0.5mg of Xanax twice a day, I haven't noticed a consistent reduction in my baseline anxiety.  However, I've observed that when I experience a more intense anxiety attack, 1mg is often effective in bringing me back to a manageable state.  These attacks are [describe *how* they impact you - e.g., 'debilitating, make it difficult to leave the house, interfere with my work']. ""

3. **Be Direct About Your Request, But Frame it as a Question & a Trial:**  ""I'm wondering if we could discuss the possibility of *temporarily* increasing the dosage to 1mg twice a day to see if it provides more consistent relief. I understand your concerns about increasing the dose, and I'm open to discussing a plan to monitor its effectiveness and reassess regularly.  I'm not looking for this to be a permanent solution, but more of a way to bridge the gap while I continue to work on longer-term strategies in therapy.""

4. **Address Your Fear of Switching Meds:** “I’m a little worried about switching medications right now because [explain why - e.g., “I’ve read about side effects of other medications, or, “I’m concerned about the disruption of switching”].  I’d like to explore if adjusting the Xanax might be possible first, if appropriate.”

5. **Emphasize Responsible Use:** ""I'm very aware of the potential for dependence, and I'm committed to using the medication responsibly, only as needed *during* attacks as well, and continuing to prioritize therapy.""

**Key Things to Emphasize:**

* **You're not just wanting *more* pills; you want *effective* relief.** You're describing a pattern you've noticed.
* **You’re aware of the risks:**  Acknowledging the potential for dependence shows you’re not taking this lightly.
* **You are committed to therapy.** This reinforces that you're not solely relying on medication.
* **You are open to a trial period and reassessment.**  This demonstrates a willingness to collaborate and monitor the situation.



**Preparing for Possible Responses**

* **She says ""No"":**  Ask *why*.  ""I understand your decision. Could you help me understand your concerns?  Are you worried about dependence?  Is there something else I should be considering?""  Then, discuss alternatives *with* her.  Maybe she'll suggest a different medication, a different therapy technique, or a plan to manage attacks without medication (which you can"
We've been dating for two months now. I have a heavy past that gets him angry. Does he have a right to penalize me for things I did before I met him?,"How is he penalizing you?Have you asked for his reasons for wanting to know about your heavy past?His answers may be very different than that he would like penalizing you.What you can do is explain how pressured you feel by his questions.Ideally, the two of you will become much closer by talking openly about your respective discomforts and wishes from the other.","Okay, this is a really common and important question in relationships, and it's good you're thinking about it. Here's a breakdown of the situation, covering his feelings, your rights, and how to navigate this, broken down into sections.  It's a long answer, because it's a complex issue!

**1. Understanding His Anger (Without Excusing It)**

First, let's acknowledge *why* he might be getting angry. It's likely not about the past events themselves, but about what they *represent* to him. It could be:

*   **Broken Trust:** Even if he logically understands it happened before him, discovering a difficult past can shake his sense of trust. He's building a future with *you now*, and past actions might feel like a betrayal of the person he *thought* he knew, or a worry about hidden things.
*   **Fear of Repetition:** He might be worried that patterns from your past will repeat in the relationship.  Even if you've explained things, fear can be hard to overcome.
*   **Feeling Hurt or Disrespected:** Depending on the nature of your past, he might feel hurt or disrespected by what happened, even if he wasn't involved. This is especially true if it involved infidelity or behaviors he finds morally objectionable.
*   **His Own Insecurities:** His anger could stem from his own insecurities and anxieties about being ""good enough"" or being able to handle your past.
*   **Lack of Understanding/Information:** He might not fully understand the context of your past, or you haven’t been able to communicate it effectively.

**However – and this is crucial – understanding *why* he's angry doesn't mean his reaction is *justified*.**



**2. Do You Deserve to Be ""Penalized""? (The Core of Your Question)**

Generally, **no, he does not have a right to penalize you for things you did before you met him.** You were a different person then, and you've presumably learned and grown since.  Here’s a more detailed explanation:

*   **Past vs. Present:**  A healthy relationship is built on the present and future, not a constant rehashing of the past.  He fell for *the person you are now*. To hold past actions against you indefinitely is to reject your growth and change.
*   **Personal Responsibility:** You took responsibility for your actions at the time (hopefully), and now you are demonstrating a commitment to a different path. He needs to respect that.
*   **Fairness & New Slate:** Entering a new relationship implies a degree of a ""new slate.""  While transparency is vital (see below), he shouldn't be using your past as a weapon or constantly bringing it up in a negative way.
*   **What does “penalize” mean?**  This is important. Is he:
    *   **Constantly bringing it up in arguments?**  (Unacceptable)
    *   **Treating you with coldness or withholding affection?** (Unacceptable)
    *   **Setting unreasonable restrictions or expectations based on your past?** (Unacceptable)
    *   **Refusing to believe your explanations or accept your apologies?** (Unacceptable)
    *   **Simply needing time to process and understand?** (More understandable, but still needs to be communicated respectfully.)



**3. What *Is* Reasonable? (What He *Can* Do)**

It *is* reasonable for him to:

*   **Ask Questions:** He has a right to understand who you are, and that includes learning about your past.  He should be able to ask respectful questions.
*   **Express His Feelings:** He’s allowed to *tell you* how your past makes him *feel* – anxious, sad, confused, etc. (But see the caveats in section 4 about *how* he expresses those feelings).
*   **Need Time to Process:** It’s okay if he needs some time to process the information you’ve shared and adjust his expectations.
*   **Set Boundaries for *Current* Behavior:** He can absolutely set boundaries about what he will and won't tolerate *in the present relationship*. (e.g., ""I'm not comfortable with you being alone with your ex,"" is a boundary about *current* behavior, not a punishment for past relationships).

**4.  Communication is Key – And How it Should Look**

This is where things get tricky.  Here's how you both need to communicate:

*   **Your Role: Transparency & Ownership:**  You need to be as transparent as you comfortably can be about your past.  You don't need to reveal every detail immediately, but you shouldn't be deceptive.  Take ownership of your past actions – apologize"
Every winter I find myself getting sad because of the weather.  How can I fight this?,"Sometimes its quite literally the lack of sunshine that can affect our mood - in these cases it can be worth experimenting with a sun lamp, to boost your dose of vitamin D, when the sun isn't naturally out. Also consider, what is it that the change in weather, changes in your life? If for example, when its sunny you are an outdoorsy, active person and when the weather changes, you're whole activity level changes along with it, you could explore how to get some of that activity replicated indoors in the winter months.","Okay, it's super common to feel down during the winter months! It's often referred to as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) or just the ""winter blues."" It's good you're recognizing it and wanting to do something about it. Here's a breakdown of things you can try, ranging from simple lifestyle adjustments to things you might discuss with a doctor. I'll categorize them for clarity.  I'll also add a ""Level of Effort"" scale (Low, Medium, High) to give you an idea of how much work each suggestion might be.

**Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. If your sadness is severe, interfering with your daily life, or you are having thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out to a mental health professional or crisis hotline (numbers at the end of this response).



**I. Light & Environment (Low to Medium Effort)**

*   **Light Therapy (Medium Effort):** This is a *very* common and effective treatment for SAD. A light therapy box emits a bright light that mimics sunlight. You sit in front of it for 20-30 minutes each morning, usually within the first hour of waking up.  *Important:* Choose a box that emits 10,000 lux and filters out UV light.  Talk to your doctor before starting, especially if you have eye conditions or take certain medications.
*   **Maximize Natural Light (Low Effort):** 
    *   Open curtains and blinds as soon as you wake up.
    *   Sit near windows during the day.
    *   Consider trimming trees or bushes that block sunlight.
    *   If possible, take your lunch break outside, even if it's just for 10-15 minutes.
*   **Brighten Your Indoor Space (Low Effort):**
    *   Use brighter light bulbs (consider daylight spectrum bulbs).
    *   Paint walls with lighter, more cheerful colors.
    *   Add mirrors to reflect light.
* **Get Outside When Possible (Low Effort):** Even on cloudy days, there's *some* light. Bundle up and take a walk.  The fresh air and change of scenery can be beneficial too.



**II. Lifestyle & Self-Care (Low to Medium Effort)**

*   **Stay Active (Medium Effort):** Exercise is a HUGE mood booster. It releases endorphins, which have mood-lifting effects.  You don't need to run a marathon; a brisk walk, dancing, yoga, or anything you enjoy counts.  Even short bursts of activity (10-15 minutes) can help.
*   **Maintain a Healthy Diet (Medium Effort):**  It's tempting to comfort eat in winter, but a diet high in sugar and processed foods can worsen mood. 
    *   Focus on whole foods: fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.
    *   Vitamin D:  Many people are deficient in Vitamin D during the winter.  Talk to your doctor about getting your levels checked and whether supplementation is right for you.  (Don't self-medicate with high doses of Vitamin D).
    *   Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Found in fatty fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts, these can also support mood.
*   **Prioritize Sleep (Low Effort):**  Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night.  A regular sleep schedule is helpful.
*   **Social Connection (Low to Medium Effort):**  Isolation can worsen SAD. Make an effort to connect with friends and family, even if you don't feel like it. 
    *   Schedule regular phone calls, video chats, or in-person visits.
    *   Join a club or group with shared interests.
    *   Volunteer your time.
*   **Practice Relaxation Techniques (Low Effort):**
    *   Meditation and mindfulness. There are tons of free guided meditations online (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer).
    *   Deep breathing exercises.
    *   Yoga or stretching.
    *   Warm baths or showers.
* **Engage in Hobbies (Low Effort):**  Do things you enjoy!  Reading, painting, listening to music, cooking, playing games – anything that brings you pleasure and takes your mind off things.
* **Plan Something to Look Forward To (Low Effort):**  Having something to anticipate, even a small event, can help boost your mood.  This could be a weekend getaway, a concert, a movie night, or even just a special dinner.



**III. Mental & Emotional Strategies (Medium Effort)**

*   **Challenge Negative Thoughts (Medium Effort):**  SAD can lead to negative thought patterns.  Try to identify and challenge these thoughts. Are they realistic? Are there alternative ways to view the situation"
"I'm planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it's hard. Sometimes it's not a physical need, it's mental.

I cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?","Hi. Good for you in planning ahead to do what's healthiest for your baby (and yourself). That's a great first step! It's also good that you are able to identify that it's not always a physical need that's driving the addiction.For the next steps, I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological (or mental) cravings are usually based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if you're consciously trying to quit, you'll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. Well, if I'm on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually I'll give in and eat it.You're going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. That's normal and, for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. That's what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it (""Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now.""), but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.I've suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they're going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.Best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby!","Okay, you're incredibly brave to recognize this and proactively address it *before* starting a family. That's a huge step, and acknowledging the mental side of the addiction is really important – you're right, it's often more than just physical! It's amazing you're already aware that the thoughts themselves are a big trigger. Here's a breakdown of strategies, geared towards the mental/emotional aspects, and practical things to do, broken down into sections.  I'll also include a *very important disclaimer* at the end.

**1. Understanding the Mental Addiction - What's Going On?**

* **Habit Loops:** Smoking is often tied to routines and feelings. Think about *when* you smoke. Is it with coffee? After meals? When stressed? When bored? When talking on the phone? These are habit loops: trigger -> behavior (smoking) -> reward (temporary relief, pleasure).  Breaking the loop means identifying the triggers and replacing the behavior.
* **Emotional Connection:**  Do you smoke when you're anxious, sad, or even happy?  Smoking might be a coping mechanism, a way to self-soothe, or a way to ""celebrate.""  You need to find healthier replacements for those emotional functions.
* **Nicotine's Effect on Brain Chemistry:** Nicotine affects dopamine levels in the brain, creating a sense of pleasure.  The brain *craves* that dopamine boost. When you stop, your brain is trying to re-regulate, leading to those persistent thoughts.
* **The ""Just One"" Thought:**  This is *very* common. It's your brain trying to rationalize and convince you it's okay to give in.  Recognize it for what it is: a trick.



**2. Strategies to Tackle the Mental Cravings & Thoughts**

* **Thought Stopping:**  This sounds simple, but it can be effective.  When you have a thought about smoking:
    * **Say ""STOP!""** (either out loud or in your head, firmly).
    * **Immediately redirect your thoughts.**  Have a go-to thought or mental image ready (see ""Distraction & Replacement"" below).  This needs practice!
* **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Techniques:** CBT helps you identify and change negative thought patterns.  Here are a few you can start with:
    * **Challenge the Thoughts:** When you think ""I *need* a cigarette,"" ask yourself: ""Is that true? What's the worst that will happen if I don't have one?  What are the benefits of *not* having one (especially thinking about your future baby)?""
    * **Thought Records:**  Write down: 1) the situation, 2) your thoughts, 3) your feelings, 4) alternative, more balanced thoughts.  This helps you see patterns.
* **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  These practices can help you become more aware of your thoughts *without* getting carried away by them.  You learn to observe the craving, acknowledge it, and let it pass without acting on it.  There are great apps like Headspace, Calm, or Insight Timer. Even 5-10 minutes a day can help.
* **Visualization:**  Regularly visualize yourself *as a non-smoker*.  Imagine how you'll feel, how proud you'll be, how healthy you'll be, and how much you're protecting your baby.  Make it vivid and detailed.
* **Journaling:**  Write about your cravings, your feelings, your triggers, and your successes.  This can be a great way to process emotions and gain insight.




**3. Distraction & Replacement - Filling the Void**

This is *crucial*. You need to replace the habit of smoking with something else.

* **Immediate Distractions (for when a craving hits):**
    * **The 4 D's:**
        * **Delay:**  Tell yourself you'll wait 10 minutes. Often the craving will subside.
        * **Deep Breathe:**  Take slow, deep breaths. Focus on your breath.
        * **Drink Water:**  Sip water slowly.
        * **Do Something Different:** Get up and walk around, listen to music, call a friend, do a quick chore.
    * **Sensory Stimulation:**  Chew gum (especially nicotine gum, if appropriate – see disclaimer), suck on a hard candy, eat a healthy snack (fruit, vegetables), smell something strong (peppermint, citrus).
* **Longer-Term Replacements (to address the emotional needs):**
    * **Exercise:** Physical activity releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects.
    * **Hobbies:** Revisit old hobbies or try new ones.  Anything that engages your mind and body."
"I'm transgender, I know I am, but I've only told a few friends. I know I can't tell my family because of previous conversations we've had. They just wouldn't accept it.
My gender dysphoria is getting really difficult to deal with on my own. I need some strategies for dealing with it. What should I do?","Hello, and thank you for your question. I am so glad that you reached out for help. I know that the dysphoria can feel nearly impossible to handle, especially since you have limited support from people who accept who you are. You may already know some of these resources, but I am going to share a few. 1. The website www.letsqueerthingsup.com is a blog from a very good writer that I know. His name is Sam Dylan Finch, and he is transgender. He writes about mental health, transgender issues, and many other topics. I know he has frequently written about gender dysphoria and ways to manage it. You may want to check out his site and do a search on there. 2. The website www.everydayfeminism.com employs many transgender writers and several have written about gender dysphoria and have given ideas for managing it. If you search for gender dysphoria on their site, many articles pop up. It may be a good resource for you, especially if you ever feel lonely and start to forget that there are others out there who are like you and have your back. 3. I am not sure where you live, but there are counselors who specialize in affirmative therapy, which is what is recommended for folks who are part of the LGBTQ community. So, if you decide to see a counselor about the dysphoria, try to find one that specifically says they have been trained in the affirmative approach. In addition, feel free to ask questions of the counselor before agreeing to see them for counseling. An ethical counselor would have no problem answering them before having you come in. 4. If there are some LGBTQ resource centers in your area, try to reach out to them and see if there are support groups. Gaining more support from others would be helpful. Sometimes LGBTQ-friendly counselors leave their contact information for people in resource centers. 5. Finally, I know you have not mentioned being depressed or suicidal, but I also know that it is very common for people to consider suicide when they are struggling with dysphoria, dealing with transphobia, etc. If this ever happens to you, please call 911 or the Trans Lifeline. It's free at 877-565-8860. Visit their site at www.translifeline.org. I hope some of these ideas help. Feel free to send another message if you have a follow-up question.Be well....be YOU.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC ","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge what you're going through and to reach out for help, even in this anonymous way. It's completely understandable that you're struggling with dysphoria, especially when you feel you can't be open with your family.  Here's a breakdown of strategies, broken down into categories, to help you cope, focusing on safety and self-care.  I'll also include resources at the end.  **Please read the disclaimer at the very end, as this is not a substitute for professional help.**

**1. Self-Soothing & Grounding Techniques (For Immediate Relief)**

These are things you can do *in the moment* when dysphoria is peaking.  Think of them as a first-aid kit for your feelings.

*   **Grounding:** Dysphoria can make you feel disconnected from your body. Grounding brings you back to the present.  Try:
    *   **5-4-3-2-1 Method:** Name 5 things you can *see*, 4 things you can *touch*, 3 things you can *hear*, 2 things you can *smell*, and 1 thing you can *taste*.
    *   **Body Scan:**  Mentally scan your body from head to toe, noticing sensations without judgment.  (Temperature, pressure, tingling, etc.)
    *   **Physical Activity:**  Gentle stretching, a walk, even just tapping your feet can help.
*   **Comforting Activities:**  What brings you joy and peace?  This could be:
    *   Listening to music.
    *   Taking a warm bath or shower.
    *   Reading a good book.
    *   Watching a favorite movie or show.
    *   Spending time in nature (if accessible and safe).
    *   Journaling (see more on this below).
*   **Affirmations:**  Even if you don't fully *believe* them yet, repeating positive statements about yourself can be helpful.  Examples:
    *   ""My feelings are valid.""
    *   ""I am worthy of love and respect.""
    *   ""I am strong and resilient.""
    *   ""I am becoming more myself every day.""
*   **Mindfulness & Meditation:** Apps like Headspace, Calm, or Insight Timer offer guided meditations that can help you focus on the present and manage difficult emotions.  Even 5-10 minutes can make a difference.

**2.  Expressive Outlets (For Processing Emotions)**

These are longer-term strategies for working *with* your dysphoria, not just suppressing it.

*   **Journaling:**  Write down your feelings, thoughts, and experiences related to your gender.  Don't worry about grammar or structure – just let it flow.  This can be a safe space to explore your identity without judgment.
*   **Creative Expression:**  This is *huge*.  Find a creative outlet that resonates with you:
    *   **Art:** Painting, drawing, sculpting, digital art.
    *   **Writing:** Poetry, short stories, songwriting.
    *   **Music:** Playing an instrument, singing.
    *   **Dance:**  Moving your body in a way that feels good.
    *   **Fashion/Clothing:** Experimenting with clothes that affirm your gender (even if only at home).
*   **Safe Exploration of Gender Presentation:**  This is about finding ways to express your gender *safely*, even if you can't fully transition.
    *   **Clothing:**  Experiment with clothing in private.
    *   **Hair:**  Changing your hairstyle.
    *   **Makeup:**  If it feels right for you.
    *   **Name/Pronouns (with trusted friends):**  Using your preferred name and pronouns with the friends who know. This is incredibly validating.

**3. Building Your Support System (Expanding Beyond Current Friends)**

You've taken the first step with your friends, which is wonderful.  Here's how to potentially expand that safely:

*   **Online Communities:**  There are many supportive online communities for transgender people.  These can provide a sense of belonging, validation, and practical advice.  (See resources below). *Be cautious about sharing personal information online.*
*   **LGBTQ+ Centers:**  If there's an LGBTQ+ center near you, they may offer support groups, counseling, and other resources.
*   **PFLAG:** PFLAG (Parents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) has chapters across the country and can offer support and education, even if *you* aren’t out to your family, they may have resources for understanding family dynamics.
*   **Consider a"
"Whenever I leave my girlfriend I get panic attacks. I'm taking medications to control them, but I'm thinking of moving in with her since I get so anxious.","I’m sorry to hear that you are currently experiencing panic attacks. I hope that the medication you have been prescribed has provided you with some relief. Unfortunately, I don’t feel that moving in with your girlfriend would alleviate your anxiety. Although you may feel very anxious about leaving her, your body is reacting to this stressful event in your life in an unhealthy manner. You may be able to render this particular situation but it’s likely that you may experience another panic attack when an additional stressful event arises. Therefore, it is essential that you address the reason for why you are experiencing panic attacks in the first place followed by practicing coping mechanisms in the case that one would arise in the future.Talk therapy has shown to be effective with those affected by anxiety along with breathing exercises and yoga. A trained therapist will be able to assist you in finding the right stress reducing method so that you can reduce the chance of another attack occurring.I wish you the best of luck! It sounds like you are very happy in your relationship and I hope you are able to reduce your anxiety so that you are able to enjoy one another.","Okay, this is a really important and complex situation, and it's good you're thinking it through. It's also good you're already addressing the panic attacks with medication – that's a really positive first step. Let's break down the thoughts and feelings here, and look at this from a few angles.  I'm going to give a fairly detailed response, covering a lot of considerations.  Because this involves mental health and a significant relationship decision, **please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is not a substitute for professional advice.**

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **You're Experiencing Separation Anxiety:** What you're describing sounds very much like separation anxiety. It's not uncommon, and it's often more intense than people realize.  It's not about the relationship *being* bad, it's about *your* brain struggling with the perceived loss of safety and security when you're not physically near your girlfriend.
* **Panic Attacks are a Signal:** Panic attacks are your body's alarm system going into overdrive. They're unpleasant, and they can be scary, but they're ultimately a sign that your nervous system is overwhelmed.  The medication is helping to manage the *symptoms*, but it's important to address the *root cause*.
* **Moving In as a Coping Mechanism:**  You're considering moving in with your girlfriend *specifically* to avoid the panic attacks. That's understandable – it feels like a logical solution. However, it's crucial to recognize that this is a **coping mechanism**, and coping mechanisms aren't always the best long-term solutions.  They can sometimes mask underlying issues and prevent you from developing healthier ways to manage anxiety.



**Why Moving In Might Not Be The Best Solution (Right Now)**

While it might *seem* like a quick fix, moving in together solely to manage your anxiety could create other problems:

* **Enmeshment:**  Over-reliance on your girlfriend for emotional regulation could lead to an unhealthy level of enmeshment in the relationship.  You both need to maintain your individual identities, interests, and space.  Constant proximity can make that harder.
* **Increased Pressure on the Relationship:** The relationship will inevitably change when you live together. Adding the pressure of being a primary anxiety ""fix"" for you is a lot for your girlfriend to carry. It could strain the relationship over time.
* **Hindered Personal Growth:**  Avoiding the anxiety doesn't help you *learn* to manage it.  You're essentially reinforcing the idea that being apart is dangerous, which will make it harder to deal with in the future.  You want to build your resilience, not avoid triggers altogether.
* **Potential for Resentment:**  Down the line, you might start to resent feeling ""stuck"" or losing your independence, and your girlfriend might feel overwhelmed by the responsibility of managing your anxiety.
* **It Doesn't Address the Core Issue:** The panic attacks are the symptom. Moving in doesn't solve the underlying anxiety.  It just changes the circumstances.

**What You Should Do Instead (Or Alongside Considering Moving In)**

Here's a more comprehensive approach:

1. **Therapy is Key:**  This is the *most* important thing.  You need to work with a therapist (a psychologist, counselor, or licensed mental health professional) to understand *why* you're experiencing separation anxiety.  They can help you develop coping strategies that don't involve avoiding separation.  Specifically look for someone trained in:
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Helps you identify and change negative thought patterns that contribute to anxiety.
    * **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):** Helps you accept anxious feelings without letting them control your behavior.
    * **Attachment-Based Therapy:** Can explore how your early attachment experiences might be contributing to your current anxiety.
2. **Gradual Exposure:** With the guidance of your therapist, you can start to gradually increase the time you spend apart from your girlfriend.  This is called exposure therapy. Start small (e.g., a short errand by yourself, then a coffee date with a friend) and slowly work your way up to longer periods of separation.  The goal is to desensitize yourself to the anxiety.
3. **Develop Independent Coping Skills:**  Your therapist can teach you techniques like:
    * **Deep Breathing Exercises:** To calm your nervous system in the moment.
    * **Mindfulness Meditation:** To focus on the present moment and reduce racing thoughts.
    * **Grounding Techniques:** To help you feel connected to your body and surroundings.
    * **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** To release physical tension.
4. **Communicate Openly with Your Girlfriend:**  Talk to her about what you're going through, and"

**1. Self-Help Strategies & Lifestyle Changes (Small Steps Matter)**

These are things you can implement into your daily life, starting small, that can have a cumulative effect.

*   **Routine:**  Depression loves chaos.  Creating a simple, predictable daily routine can be surprisingly helpful.  It doesn't have to be rigid! Think: wake up around the same time, eat meals (even simple ones) at roughly the same time, and have a designated bedtime.
*   **Physical Activity:**  This is HUGE, even if you *really* don't feel like it.  Exercise releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects.  Start ridiculously small.  A 10-minute walk.  Stretching.  Dancing to one song.  The goal is *movement*, not a marathon.  Do what feels least overwhelming.
*   **Sunlight & Nature:**  Exposure to sunlight helps regulate your body's natural rhythms and can improve mood.  Spend some time outdoors, even if it's just sitting by a window.  Even looking at pictures of nature can help.
*   **Healthy Eating:**  When you're depressed, it's easy to fall into unhealthy eating patterns.  Focus on nourishing your body with whole foods.  Again, small steps – adding one fruit or vegetable to a meal, swapping soda for water.
*   **Sleep Hygiene:**  Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep.  Create a relaxing bedtime routine (warm bath, reading, calming music).  Avoid screens for at least an hour before bed.  Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.
*   **Mindfulness & Relaxation Techniques:**
    *   **Deep Breathing:**  Simple and accessible anywhere.  There are tons of guided deep breathing exercises on YouTube or apps.
    *   **Meditation:**  Start with short guided meditations (5-10 minutes). Apps like Calm, Headspace, and Insight Timer offer free options.
    *   **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:**  Tense and release different muscle groups to reduce physical tension.
    *   **Grounding Techniques:** If you feel overwhelmed or anxious, grounding can bring you back to the present moment.  (Example:  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, 1 thing you can taste).

**2.  Self-Reflection & Journaling**

*   **Journaling:** This can be a really private way to process your thoughts and feelings.  You don't have to write beautifully or eloquently. Just get things *out* of your head.  You can write about your day, your emotions, your fears, your hopes, anything.  Consider prompts like:
    *   ""What am I grateful for today?"" (even if it's something small)
    *   ""What is one small thing I did well today?""
    *   ""How am I feeling right now, and why?""
*   **Identifying Negative Thought Patterns:**  Depression often involves negative self-talk.  Start paying attention to your inner critic.  Are you frequently putting yourself down?  Are you catastrophizing (assuming the worst)?  Writing these thoughts down can help you see them more objectively.
*   **Challenging Negative Thoughts:**  Once you identify negative thoughts, try to challenge them.  Ask yourself: ""Is this thought based on facts, or just feelings?""  ""Is there another way to look at this situation?""  ""What would I tell a friend who was thinking this way?""

**3.  Creative Outlets & Activities**

*   **Engage in Hobbies:**  Reconnect with activities you used to enjoy, or try something new.  Painting, drawing, writing, playing music, reading, gardening, cooking – anything that allows you to express yourself or lose yourself in the moment.
*   **Listen to Music:**  Music can be incredibly powerful"
"I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.
I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. While your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard. Talk to them during a non-emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as ""you NEVER listen,"" ""you ALWAYS say..."" and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with ""you"" try using ""I"" by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist, teacher, or school counselor if possible. Most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help.Best of luck to you.","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult and isolating. It's really brave of you to articulate all of this – it takes strength to admit when you're hurting and feeling alone. It’s completely understandable why you're feeling overwhelmed with stress and anxiety given the situation you've described. Let's break this down and explore some ways to approach these challenges.

**First, validating your feelings:**

* **Your feelings are *completely* valid.** Feeling unheard, unsupported, and distrusted by both your parents *and* friends is deeply painful.  It's okay to grieve the childhood you feel you missed and the relationships you wish you had.
* **It's not selfish to need support.** You are a good person for being there for your friends, but you deserve that same support in return.  It's not about keeping score; it's about reciprocal care within friendships.
* **It's hard to navigate being pansexual when you fear your parents' reaction.**  Coming to terms with your identity is a personal journey, and doing so without a safe and supportive environment is significantly harder.
* **Winning the fight against depression is a huge accomplishment.** You *have* shown resilience and strength. Don't minimize that.  However, it's also completely normal for stress and anxiety to resurface, especially when facing ongoing difficult situations.



**Let’s tackle each area - Parents, Friends, and Yourself:**

**1. Dealing with Your Parents:**

This is the toughest one, and it's likely to be a long process. Here's a realistic approach:

* **Lower Expectations (for now):**  This sounds harsh, but it's about self-protection.  If they've consistently invalidated your feelings in the past, expecting a sudden change is likely to lead to more hurt.  Accepting this *doesn't* mean you don't deserve better, it means you're adjusting your expectations to protect your emotional well-being.
* **Focus on Information, Not Emotion (initially):**  When you need to share something important, try to present it as factual information, rather than a plea for emotional support.  Instead of saying, ""I'm so upset about this,"" try, ""This happened, and I wanted to let you know.""  This might bypass their tendency to dismiss emotional reactions.
* **""I"" Statements:** Practice using ""I"" statements to express your feelings without blaming.  Instead of ""You never believe me,"" try ""I feel unheard when my experiences are questioned.""
* **Acceptance (of their limitations):** This is hard.  Your parents may have their own issues that prevent them from being the supportive figures you need.  This doesn’t excuse their behavior, but it might help you understand it.  
* **Consider a ""Script"":**  Before a difficult conversation, write down what you want to say. This helps you stay focused and prevents them from derailing the conversation.
* **Regarding your sexuality:**  You don't *have* to come out to them if you don't feel safe. Your safety and well-being are paramount. If you do decide to come out, prepare for a range of reactions and have a support system in place *beforehand*.  Consider writing a letter, which allows you to express yourself without interruption.
* **Limited Engagement:** It’s okay to limit how much you share with them, especially about emotionally sensitive topics.  You can still have a relationship with them without being completely open.

**2. Navigating Friendships:**

* **Honest Conversation (with chosen friends):**  Choose *one* friend you feel closest to and have an honest conversation.  Explain that you feel like you're always there for them, but you need support sometimes too.  Be specific about what kind of support you need (e.g., ""Just listening without offering advice would be really helpful right now,"" or ""Could you just check in on me once in a while?"").
* **Reciprocity Check:**  Pay attention to the pattern of your friendships.  Are you consistently the giver, and they are consistently the taker?  Healthy friendships are balanced.
* **It's Okay to Distance:**  If friends consistently fail to reciprocate, it's okay to create some distance.  This doesn't mean ending the friendship, but it might mean spending less time with them or not sharing as much.
* **Expand Your Circle:**  Actively seek out new friendships through shared interests (clubs, hobbies, volunteering).
* **Be Okay with Different Levels of Closeness:** Not all friendships need to be deeply intimate. Some can be more casual, and that's perfectly fine.

**3.  Taking Care of Yourself:**

* **Prioritize Self-Care:** This isn't just bubble baths (though those are nice!). It's"
"My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the ""straight and narrow"" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that I'm not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others.    His insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","You might ask your fiance about people who have let him down in the past; past hurts from parents, friends, people he has dated. If you are speaking about jealousy he may come from a divorced parent upbringing, may have seen parents cheat on one or the other, may have had partners cheat on him in the past.  He may have fears that you may go off the ""straight and narrow"" once you get married. Listen to any concerns with patience and understanding, avoid being defensive. I would highly encourage pre-marital counseling to explore these things and individual counseling for himself to work on fears and anxieties. If he refuses and things do not improve I would consider postponing the wedding, things will not get better once you get married, only magnified.  Finally show him Bible passages about forgiveness and worry and leaning on God with faith and hope for the future.    God bless.","Okay, this is a really common and deeply sensitive issue, especially within a Christian framework where premarital purity is often emphasized. It's good you're recognizing this pattern of insecurity in him, as that's key to addressing it. Here's a breakdown of how you can approach this, broken down into sections.  It's going to require patience, honesty, and potentially professional guidance.  I'll also include a section on setting boundaries because your well-being is paramount.

**1. Understanding the Roots of His Struggle**

* **His Own Past:** You mentioned he also went ""off the straight and narrow.""  His difficulty with *your* past could be a projection of his own guilt, shame, or regret. He might be judging you based on standards he’s not fully living up to himself.  He might be experiencing internal conflict and feeling hypocritical.
* **Religious Trauma/Strict Upbringing:** A very strict or legalistic upbringing can create a lot of shame around sexuality and past mistakes.  Even if he *intellectually* believes in forgiveness, deeply ingrained beliefs can be hard to shake.  He may have absorbed messages that equate sexual experience with ""brokenness"" or being ""unworthy.""
* **Insecurity & Control:**  His need to control aspects of your past might stem from a deeper insecurity about himself, the relationship, or his ability to provide/be ""enough.""  Trying to control your past can be a (misguided) attempt to feel secure in the present.
* **Misunderstanding of Grace & Forgiveness:**  A core tenet of Christianity is grace and forgiveness. He may struggle to *apply* these concepts to you, even while believing in them.



**2.  Communication Strategies – Starting the Conversation**

* **Choose the Right Time & Place:**  Not during an argument.  Pick a calm, private setting where you both feel safe and comfortable.  Avoid distractions.
* **""I Feel"" Statements:**  This is crucial.  Instead of ""You make me feel bad when you..."", try ""I feel hurt and unsupported when my past is brought up.""  Focus on *your* emotions, not his character flaws.
* **Validate His Feelings (Initially):**  ""I understand this is something you've struggled with, and I appreciate you being honest about your discomfort.""  (This doesn't mean you agree with his reaction, just that you acknowledge his feelings exist.)  But don't over-validate to the point of minimizing your own pain.
* **Gently Challenge His Thinking:**  After validating, you can gently ask questions:
    *  ""Where is this coming from for you? What specifically feels difficult about this?""
    * ""Do you think holding onto this is helping *us* move forward?""
    * ""How does focusing on the past align with what we believe about forgiveness?""
    * “Are you feeling shame about your own past experiences?”
* **Reiterate Your Commitment:**  ""I love you and I'm committed to our future. My past doesn't change that.""
* **Focus on the Present & Future:**  ""What matters now is the love and commitment we share today.  Let's focus on building our life *together*.""
* **Share Your Perspective (Carefully):**  Explain how his dwelling on the past impacts you.  ""When you bring this up, it makes me feel judged and unloved. It creates distance between us.""



**3.  Addressing the Religious Aspect (Delicately)**

* **Shared Values:**  Start by reaffirming your shared faith and values.  ""We both believe in God's grace and forgiveness, right?""
* **Scriptural Reminders:**  If he's receptive, gently share verses about forgiveness, new beginnings, and God's unconditional love. (Romans 8:1, 2 Corinthians 5:17, Psalm 103:12 are good starting points).  *Be cautious about ""weaponizing"" scripture.*  It shouldn't feel like you're trying to ""win"" an argument with the Bible.
* **Talk to a Pastor/Counselor (Together):** A pastor or Christian counselor can provide a neutral space to discuss these issues and offer guidance from a faith-based perspective.  This is often *very* helpful.  Look for someone who is known for grace and understanding, not judgment.
* **Emphasize Transformation, Not Perfection:**  Both of you have likely grown and changed since your past experiences.  Highlight that God values transformation and growth.




**4.  Addressing His Insecurities (This is Long-Term Work)**

* **Encourage Self-Reflection:**  Help him explore *why* he feels insecure.  What are his fears?  What are his expectations?
* **Positive Reinforcement:**  Focus on his strengths"
My fiancé and I broke up. He cheated on me numerous times. I kept forgiving but questioning his every move. He got tired and left.,"Cheating on you shows a lack of commitment, in addition to the emotional hurt it creates.Probably you didn't actually forgive him because if you did, then you wouldn't have been asking questions of his every move.Maybe you were open to forgiving him.   In order for forgiveness to be effective, the person who has done the injuring must first show some understanding and empathy for the great pain the person caused in you.From what you write, your fiancé didn't seem to have much interest in earning back your trust or in empathizing with the way his cheating effected you.It is very likely his tiredness is also tiredness you feel, of having to watch him all the time.As uncomfortable as adjusting with the disappointment of him leaving you, the situation you describe sounds like it was unsatisfying for both of you.","Okay, this is incredibly painful, and I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's a really tough situation, and it sounds like you've been carrying a lot of hurt for a long time. It's completely understandable that you're feeling a mix of emotions right now - grief, anger, confusion, perhaps even a bit of relief mixed with the pain.  Let's break down what you've shared and talk about how to navigate this.

**First, acknowledging the pain:**

* **You are allowed to grieve.** Even though he was the one who was unfaithful, and even though it ultimately led to this, ending a relationship is *always* a loss. You're grieving the future you imagined, the commitment that was broken, and the person you thought he was. Don't minimize your pain.
* **It's valid to feel confused.**  You kept forgiving him, and that's a complex thing. It speaks to your capacity for love and wanting to make things work, but it also sounds like it created a very difficult dynamic.
* **His leaving doesn't diminish the hurt he caused.** Him getting ""tired"" of the situation doesn't excuse his repeated infidelity.  It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking ""if I hadn't..."" but his actions are *his* responsibility.



**Let's talk about the dynamic:**

You mentioned forgiving him repeatedly, but also questioning his every move. This is a really important point.  This pattern is incredibly common in situations with infidelity. 

* **The Cycle of Betrayal:**  Infidelity shatters trust.  When trust is broken, it's natural to become hyper-vigilant, trying to prevent it from happening again.  This hyper-vigilance (questioning his movements, checking his phone, etc.) is exhausting for both people. While understandable, it also creates a dynamic of control and suspicion that isn't healthy.
* **Forgiveness and Trust are Different:** You can *forgive* someone (release the anger and resentment), but forgiveness doesn't automatically rebuild *trust*. Trust is earned over time through consistent, honest behavior. It sounds like the trust wasn't being rebuilt, leading to the continued questioning.
* **You were likely trying to protect yourself.** Questioning his every move was likely a way to try and manage your anxiety and prevent further hurt. It's a self-protective mechanism, even though it was exhausting.




**What now? (Moving Forward)**

This is the hardest part, but also the most important. Here's a breakdown of things to focus on:

1. **No Contact (Seriously):** This is *crucial* for your healing.  I know it's hard, but you need space to process your emotions without being influenced by him.  This means:
    * No calls
    * No texts
    * No social media stalking (unfollow, mute, or block if necessary)
    * No ""checking in"" through mutual friends
    * No accidental run-ins (avoid places you know he frequents)
    * **Why it's important:** No contact allows you to detach emotionally, rebuild your sense of self, and break the cycle of hoping things will change.

2. **Allow Yourself to Feel:**  Don't suppress your emotions. Cry, scream into a pillow, journal, talk to a friend – whatever you need to do to release the pain.  Trying to bottle things up will only prolong the healing process.

3. **Seek Support:**
    * **Friends and Family:** Lean on your support network. Talk to people you trust who will listen without judgment.
    * **Therapy:**  This is *highly* recommended. A therapist can provide a safe space to process your emotions, understand the dynamics of the relationship, and develop healthy coping mechanisms.  They can also help you rebuild your self-esteem and trust.  Look for a therapist specializing in relationship trauma or infidelity.
    * **Support Groups:**  Connecting with others who have gone through similar experiences can be incredibly validating and empowering.

4. **Focus on Self-Care:**  Now is the time to prioritize *you*.
    * **Physical Health:** Eat nourishing foods, get enough sleep, and exercise.
    * **Emotional Health:**  Engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.  Read a book, take a bath, listen to music, spend time in nature.
    * **Rediscover Yourself:** What are your passions and interests?  What did you enjoy doing *before* the relationship?  Reconnecting with your individual identity is essential.

5. **Rebuild Trust (in Yourself):**  This is the long-term work. You need to rebuild your trust in your own judgment.  
    * **Recognize Your Worth:** You deserve someone"
"My girlfriend and I have broken up and gotten back together numerous times in the past two years. We recently just broke up again last night on New Year’s Eve. When we break up, the very next day, she calls me and acts as if nothing has happened. She acts like everything is alright. This has been going on for two years. I do love her and care about her and her children a lot, but she seems really demanding as far as what she deserves from a man. She is always telling me that she deserves this and that from a man. It makes me feel like crap because I cannot give her everything that she wants. She told me one time that she wants a man who is going to be afraid to lose her. Is that a normal thing that women want, or should I just move on already? I am in my 30s and she is in her 40s.","Love is not enough to keep a relationship together.The people need to get along happily too.Let's start with knowing more about your happiness in being with your partner.The frequent break ups happen for a reason.  Try understanding more of why you go back together again.You state a few very clear reasons to not continue this relationship, such as ""feeling like crap"" and not liking that your girlfriend hopes her  partner will feel afraid to leave her.Trust your intuition telling you that these feelings matter.Sometimes men aren't sure whether following their instinct is a right action to take.It is.Also, hoping a partner will fear losing them, shows a wish to control a person.Control has nothing to do with love and trust, and these are basics of a relationship.Good luck!","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and you're right to question it. You're caught in a cycle, and it's exhausting and damaging to your self-worth. Let's break down what's happening and then address your question about whether her desires are ""normal"" and what *you* should do.

**Understanding the Cycle**

What you're describing is a classic push-pull dynamic. She breaks up with you (the push), then immediately reverts to normalcy (the pull). This is incredibly confusing and emotionally manipulative, even if she doesn't intend it to be. Here's what's likely going on *from her side* (though remember, you can't know her motivations for sure - this is educated guessing based on the pattern):

* **Testing:** She may be testing your boundaries and your level of affection. Breaking up and then seeing how you react allows her to gauge how much you care.
* **Control:** The cycle gives her a sense of control in the relationship. She initiates the break, then dictates the terms of re-engagement.
* **Fear of Intimacy:** Paradoxically, someone who *says* they want intense devotion might also be scared of true vulnerability.  Creating drama and instability can be a way to keep intimacy at bay.
* **Unresolved Issues:**  The repeated breakups suggest underlying issues that are never truly addressed. They surface, cause a rupture, and then get swept under the rug with a return to ""normal.""
* **Seeking Validation:**  Her constant talk about what she ""deserves"" could be rooted in a need for validation.  

**The ""Afraid to Lose Me"" Statement**

This is a *very* telling statement.  Wanting a partner who values you and *shows* that value is healthy.  Wanting someone to be ""afraid to lose you"" is different. It leans towards:

* **Needing Control:** It's not about being loved; it's about having power in the relationship. It's about needing to feel like she's the prize, and you're constantly striving to keep her.
* **Insecurity (masked as confidence):**  It can stem from deep-seated insecurities.  If she doesn't feel inherently worthy, she may seek constant reassurance *through* your fear of losing her.
* **Unrealistic Expectations:**  Healthy relationships are built on trust, respect, and mutual effort, not on one person constantly trying to prove their worth.

**Is This ""Normal""?**

No, it's not a healthy or ""normal"" expectation to *want* someone to be afraid to lose you.  Most people want to be cherished, respected, and loved freely, not held onto through anxiety or a power imbalance.  It's a red flag for potential emotional manipulation and a lack of genuine emotional maturity.  

While many people want to feel valued, the *fear* aspect is where it becomes problematic.  Healthy attraction and desire to maintain a relationship come from a place of wanting to *be* with someone, not from fear of being without them.



**What You Should Do:  This is the Crucial Part**

You are in your 30s. You deserve a relationship that is stable, respectful, and fulfilling – not one that leaves you feeling emotionally drained and unworthy. Here's a plan:

1. **No Contact (Seriously):**  This is the hardest, but most important step.  When she calls acting like nothing happened, **do not answer.** If you do answer, keep it very brief: ""I need space right now,"" and then end the conversation.  Block her number if you need to.  This includes social media.  You need to break the cycle.  Every time you respond, you reinforce the behavior.
2. **Focus on Yourself:**  This is the time to reinvest in *you*.  What are your hobbies?  What makes you happy?  Spend time with friends and family who support you.  Consider therapy (see point #5).
3. **Identify *Your* Needs:**  You said she's demanding. What do *you* need in a relationship? Write it down.  Be specific.  What are your non-negotiables?  What are you willing to compromise on?
4. **Recognize the Pattern:** You've already started this by recognizing the cycle.  Continue to be aware of how she operates.  Understanding the pattern will help you resist being pulled back in.
5. **Consider Therapy:** A therapist can help you understand why you’re drawn to this dynamic, build your self-esteem, and develop healthy boundaries.  They can also help you process the emotional toll this relationship has taken on you.
6. **If She Does Reach Out (After a Period of No Contact):**  Be prepared.  She might apologize"
"My coworkers are making false statements about me to the boss, saying I have mood swings. They have no proof to back it up. Can my employer make me see a therapist of their choice?","If this is a concern of a few coworkers, make sure it is not something they see but you don't admit to.  Employers can ""suggest"" or something ""stipulate"" in continued employment with them  for you to go to their Employment Assistance Provider (EAP) if they have noticed the same behavior and concerned of how it is effecting productivity or employee relationships.  No one wants to work in a environment which they consider hostile.  Employers can be held responsible if they do not take action.Couple of things you can do...Ask a coworker in which you trust and respect if what others are saying is true?Seek professional help from your primary care provider or counselor if mood swings do exist.      ","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and you're right to be concerned about your rights. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, what your employer can and can't do, and what steps you should take, covering the legal aspects as well as practical advice.  I'll also include a disclaimer at the end, as I'm not a lawyer.

**1. Understanding the Situation: Defamation & Potential Discrimination**

* **Defamation (Libel/Slander):** What your coworkers are doing *could* be defamation.  Specifically, it's likely *slander* (spoken defamation). To prove defamation, you generally need to show:
    * **False Statement:** The statements are factually untrue.  ""Mood swings"" without specific examples that are demonstrably false is harder to prove, but can still be problematic, especially if it's presented as fact.
    * **Publication:** The statement was communicated to a third party (your boss).
    * **Harm:** The statement harmed your reputation. This is the tricky part.  Damage to your career, being passed over for promotion, or a hostile work environment could be considered harm.
    * **Fault:**  Depending on the circumstances and your location, you may need to prove the person making the statement knew it was false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth.
* **Potential Discrimination:** If the ""mood swings"" accusation is linked to a protected characteristic (like gender, race, religion, disability – even perceived disability like a mental health condition), it could be considered discrimination.  For example, if they're saying you have mood swings *because* you're a woman (stereotyping) or *because* you're perceived as having a mental health condition, that's a serious issue.
* **The Core Problem:**  Even without discrimination, spreading false information about your work performance or character is a problem and creates a hostile work environment.



**2. Can Your Employer *Make* You See a Therapist?**

This is the central question, and the answer is usually **no, not generally, but it's complicated.** Here's a breakdown:

* **Generally Illegal to Force Therapy:**  In most places, an employer cannot *force* you to undergo a psychological evaluation or therapy. This is a violation of your privacy and could be considered coercive.  The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) protects you from being forced to disclose medical information or undergo medical examinations unless there's a *job-related and consistent with business necessity* justification.
* **""Fitness for Duty"" Evaluations (With Caveats):**  There *are* situations where an employer can request an evaluation, but it's very specific:
    * **Objective Evidence of Performance Issues:**  The employer must have *objective, documented evidence* of performance problems that are impacting your ability to do your job.  Rumors from coworkers are *not* sufficient.  Examples include missed deadlines, errors in work, complaints from clients *with details*, or documented behavioral issues (again, specific incidents, not vague accusations).
    * **Job-Related Concern:** The employer must be able to demonstrate a reasonable belief that a medical condition (including mental health) is affecting your ability to perform the essential functions of your job safely and effectively.  ""Mood swings"" alone is not enough.
    * **Non-Discriminatory Approach:**  The employer must apply this policy consistently to all employees.  They can't single you out.
    * **Confidentiality:** Any information obtained from the evaluation must be kept confidential.
    * **Last Resort:**  The evaluation should be a last resort after other attempts to address performance issues have failed.
* **Request vs. Demand:**  An employer can *request* you to voluntarily undergo an evaluation, especially if you're struggling and it might help resolve performance concerns.  However, you are usually not obligated to comply.
* **Employer-Provided EAP (Employee Assistance Program):**  Many companies offer EAPs, which provide confidential counseling services.  Using an EAP is *voluntary* and is generally separate from any employer requirement for evaluation.  EAPs are a good resource if *you* want support.
* **Threats and Coercion:** If your employer is threatening you with negative consequences (demotion, termination) if you don't comply with a therapy demand *without* a legitimate, job-related reason, that is very concerning and potentially illegal.



**3. What Should You Do?  (Action Steps)**

1. **Document Everything:** *This is crucial.*
   * **Dates and Times:** Record every instance of your coworkers making these statements.
   * **Specific Statements:** Write down *exactly* what they said, as close to verbatim as possible.
   * **Witnesses:** Note if anyone else was present when the statements were made"
"My ex-boyfriend and I have been back and forth for over a year now. He's in his late 20s, divorced for like five years now with two kids. He has a lot of narcissistic behaviors. He lies and cheats, but I love him. I've tried to date other people, but I always go back to him.","There are a lot of pieces to the decision of whether to stay or leave. Can you have open conversations about your concerns? Is he able to listen to that? I'm not sure how you know for sure that he lies and cheats, but does he recognize these things as problems? Which part of you is bigger: the part of you that wants to stay or the part of you that wants to leave? Can you consider what you want, wish for, and desire while also considering the same for him? Can he do that for you?","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and you're being very honest about it, which is a good first step. It's clear you're caught in a painful cycle, and acknowledging the problematic behaviors *and* your own feelings is important. Let's break down what's happening and explore some ways to think about this.  I'm going to give a fairly lengthy response because this is complex, and I want to cover a lot of ground.  **Please read the disclaimer at the very end – I am not a therapist, and this is not therapy.**

**Understanding the Dynamic**

* **The Pull of Familiarity:** Even a *painful* familiar pattern can be incredibly strong. It's comfortable, in a twisted way. You know his buttons, he knows yours. This is especially true when you've been on and off for a year – it creates a sort of distorted ""normal.""
* **Trauma Bonding:** This is *very* common in relationships with narcissistic individuals. The cycle of idealization (love bombing, making you feel amazing), devaluation (criticism, gaslighting, cheating), and discard (breaking up) is incredibly addictive.  The intermittent reinforcement – the good times interspersed with the bad – creates a strong emotional attachment, even when the overall experience is damaging.  You crave the ""good"" times, and keep hoping they'll last longer this time.
* **Love & Hope vs. Reality:** You *do* love him, and it's completely valid to feel that way. However, love doesn't excuse harmful behavior. It sounds like you're operating with a hope of who he *could* be, rather than accepting who he *is*.
* **Narcissistic Behavior - A Red Flag:** You've identified narcissistic behaviors, and that's crucial.  Lying and cheating are major breaches of trust and demonstrate a lack of respect for you *and* his ex-wife and children.  Narcissism exists on a spectrum, but even milder forms can be incredibly damaging in a relationship.  They often lack empathy, have a strong need for control, and struggle with accountability.
* **Your Pattern of Returning:** You've identified that you keep going back. This isn't a weakness, but a pattern that needs understanding.  Ask yourself *why* you return. Is it loneliness?  A belief you can ""fix"" him?  Fear of being alone?  The pull of the initial good feelings?

**Why Dating Others Isn't Working (Yet)**

You mention trying to date others, but always returning. Here's why this might be happening:

* **Emotional Unavailability:** You may be emotionally invested in this ex and not fully open to forming a genuine connection with someone new. You're likely comparing everyone to him, even subconsciously.
* **Low Self-Worth:** Narcissistic relationships can erode your self-esteem. You may believe you don't deserve better, or that he's the best you can get.
* **The ""Rescue Fantasy"":**  You might be subconsciously drawn to the idea of ""fixing"" him, which can give you a sense of purpose.  However, you can't change someone who doesn't want to change.
* **Lingering Hope:** The hope that *this time* will be different keeps resurfacing, preventing you from fully investing in new relationships.



**What You Can Do - A Path Forward**

This won't be easy, but it's possible to break the cycle. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Radical Acceptance (The Hardest Part):**  Accept that he *is* who he is.  He's a divorced man with children who has demonstrated a pattern of lying and cheating.  Stop hoping he'll change.  This doesn't mean you stop caring, but you need to stop expecting him to be someone he's not.  Recognize that his behavior is about *him*, not about you.

2. **No Contact (Essential):** This is the most difficult, but often the most effective step.  Absolutely *no* contact – no texts, calls, social media stalking, ""accidental"" run-ins.  This includes asking mutual friends about him.  You need space to heal and break the emotional connection.  The initial period should be a minimum of 30-60 days, but longer is better.  Treat it like grieving a loss, because you are.

3. **Focus on Yourself:**  This is where you reclaim your life.
    * **Therapy:**  Seriously consider therapy. A therapist can help you understand the dynamic, process your emotions, build self-esteem, and develop healthy boundaries.  Look for someone experienced in dealing with narcissistic abuse or trauma bonding.
    * **Self-Care:**  Rediscover activities you enjoy.  Spend"
"Whenever I don't tell my friends or anyone what I did or stuff that's not really important, I feel terrible, like there’s a hole in my stomach. It only goes away when I hurt myself.","Hi Kansas, I feel strongly that the help of a professional therapist is important here. Feelings are never wrong, but it can help to understand where they come from and talk to someone who can teach you healthy ways to cope. Self-harm is not the answer to managing those emotions you feel in your stomach. Although I'm glad you said something here, a professional would need to spend some time with you and get a deep understanding of your life in order to help you sort all these reactions out effectively. I hope you reach out to someone soon. ","Okay, this sounds really tough, and I want you to know you're incredibly brave for sharing this. It takes a lot of courage to talk about something like this, and I'm glad you reached out.  What you're describing – feeling a physical discomfort and then finding that self-harm alleviates it – is a really serious sign that you're struggling with a lot.  It's *not* a solution, even though it feels like it in the moment, and it's a pattern that needs to be addressed.  Let's break down what's happening and what you can do.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Emotional Numbing & Avoidance:** The discomfort you feel when you *don't* share things, even small things, suggests a strong need for connection and validation.  It's almost like you feel invisible or unreal if you don't express yourself.  The ""hole in your stomach"" is your body's way of signaling intense emotional distress.  This can stem from a lot of things – past experiences where your feelings weren't acknowledged, difficulty regulating emotions, or feeling like you don't matter.
* **The Cycle of Self-Harm:**  Self-harm isn't about wanting to die; it's often about *feeling* something, *anything*, when feeling overwhelmed and numb.  It’s a way to cope with intense emotional pain, even if it's temporary and ultimately harmful.  The physical sensation can be a distraction from the emotional pain, and it can sometimes create a release of endorphins that temporarily mask the feelings.  The fact that it *stops* the stomach pain is a key indicator that it's become a maladaptive coping mechanism.
* **Underlying Issues:** This pattern often points to underlying issues like:
    * **Anxiety:**  Worries about what others think, fear of judgment, or a general sense of unease.
    * **Depression:** Feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or worthlessness.
    * **Trauma:** Past experiences that have been difficult to process.
    * **Attachment Issues:** Difficulties with forming healthy relationships and feeling securely connected to others.
    * **Difficulty with Emotional Regulation:** Struggling to manage and cope with strong emotions in healthy ways.
    * **Low Self-Esteem:** Feeling unworthy or inadequate.



**Why This Is So Important to Address**

This cycle is incredibly dangerous and can escalate.  Even if you don't intend to end your life, self-harm can become more frequent, more severe, and potentially lead to accidental injury or death.  More importantly, it keeps you trapped in a pattern of pain and prevents you from developing healthy coping mechanisms.

**What You Can Do – *Right Now* and Longer Term**

**1. Immediate Safety (If you are in immediate danger, skip to section 3)**

* **Recognize the Urge:**  Pay attention to the feeling *before* you act on the urge to self-harm.  What triggers it? What thoughts are going through your head?  The earlier you can recognize it, the better.
* **Distraction (Temporary):**  While not a long-term solution, distraction can help you get through a particularly intense moment. Try:
    * Listening to music (something upbeat or calming, depending on what you need).
    * Watching a favorite movie or TV show.
    * Reading a book.
    * Exercising (going for a walk, dancing, etc.).
    * Spending time with a pet.
    * Doing a puzzle.
* **Self-Soothing (Temporary):** Engage your senses in a calming way:
    * Take a warm bath or shower.
    * Wrap yourself in a blanket.
    * Drink a warm beverage (tea, hot chocolate).
    * Use aromatherapy (lavender, chamomile).
    * Hold an ice cube in your hand (the intense sensation can be grounding).

**2.  Longer-Term Strategies – *These are crucial***

* **Therapy:**  This is the *most important* step.  A therapist can help you:
    * **Identify the underlying causes** of your emotional distress.
    * **Develop healthy coping mechanisms** to manage your emotions.
    * **Process any past trauma** that may be contributing to your struggles.
    * **Improve your self-esteem and self-worth.**
    * **Learn to regulate your emotions.**
    * **Address any attachment issues.**
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** and **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)** are particularly effective for people who self-harm.  DBT specifically teaches skills for emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and mindfulness.
* **Healthy Communication:**  Start small.  Practice sharing *something* with someone you"
"My husband has had issues with alcohol addiction in the past (he'd never admit to this). A while back (3 years ago), I asked him to stop drinking so much, and he agreed. I caught him one night drinking behind my back. I confronted him and he lied, but I told him I knew he was lying because I counted the beers in the fridge and four of them were missing. He admitted and apologized and promised he wouldn't do it again. Lately, my husband has been drinking on and off, but I noticed it was every single night. I didn't like this. For our New Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board—no more drinking every night.
 The other night, I counted the beers in the fridge just to see if some were missing. It took a couple of days, but tonight, I discovered a few were missing along with a shot of vodka. He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.  I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. I just feel like I'm so honest with him about everything, and I expect the same honesty. He is a good husband in every other regard.","As exasperated as you feel, and as obvious it is to you that your husband cares more about drinking than being honest with you, changing this is up to him.Does he care that you're upset with him for drinking more than he can handle?Does he care about you more than drinking?Living with an alcoholic, which is how his behavior sounds, is lonely and frustrating.Concentrate on what you like about him as he is now with his drinking.Your happiness matters.  His ignoring of what you're talking about, doesn't mean your requests are unreasonable.Be prepared to learn to live with and accept how he behaves, or not.Avoid the expectation that you can convince him to change.People change only when they realize their life can improve by changing.  He doesn't sound like this, at least now.","You are absolutely *not* overreacting. Your feelings are completely valid and understandable. This isn't about the alcohol itself, as much as it is about the dishonesty and the broken trust. You're right to feel hurt and frustrated. Here's a breakdown of why, and what you can consider doing:

**Why You're Right to Feel This Way:**

* **Repeated Pattern of Deception:** This isn't a one-time slip-up. This is a pattern. He agreed to limit drinking, then drank secretly, lied about it, and you *caught* him. It's happened before, and now it's happening again. The pattern is what's so damaging.
* **Erosion of Trust:** You’ve explicitly stated you value honesty, and you offer it to him. His repeated dishonesty is a direct violation of that. It creates a feeling of walking on eggshells, constantly monitoring, and questioning everything.
* **The ""Counting Beers"" is a Symptom, Not the Problem:** You feel the need to *count the beers* because you don't trust him to be honest. That's a heartbreaking position to be in within a marriage. The counting is a response to *his* behavior.
* **The Snapping and Slurring:** His defensive and dismissive reaction (snapping ""no"" and slurring) further confirms your suspicions and is disrespectful. It's a classic reaction from someone trying to conceal something.
* **Impact on You:** His drinking *directly* affects you (the snoring, your sleep). This isn't just about him; it's impacting your well-being.
* **The Underlying Addiction:** While he won't admit to an addiction, his behavior strongly suggests one is present. Addiction thrives on secrecy and denial.

**What you can consider doing:**

* **Shift the Focus From the Drinking to the Dishonesty:** Instead of framing conversations solely around ""you're drinking too much,"" focus on the lying.  Say something like: ""I'm not as upset about the drinking as I am about you telling me you weren't drinking when I knew you were. It breaks my trust in you.""
* **""I"" Statements:** Continue to use ""I"" statements.  Instead of “You lied to me,” try “I feel hurt and betrayed when I find out you haven’t been honest with me.”
* **Don’t Engage When He’s Intoxicated:** You did the right thing by going to bed. Trying to have a rational conversation with someone who is impaired is usually fruitless and can escalate things.
* **Consider Couples Counseling:** This is a crucial step. A therapist can provide a safe space for both of you to communicate, and can help him address potential underlying issues. They can also help *you* navigate this difficult situation.
* **Individual Therapy for *You*:** This is also important! You need support. A therapist can help you process your feelings, set healthy boundaries, and develop coping strategies.
* **Al-Anon:** This is a support group specifically for families and friends of people with alcohol problems. It can provide a sense of community and understanding. (al-anon.org)
* **Set Boundaries:**  This is where it gets hard.  Think about what you *will* and *won't* tolerate. For example: ""I will not stay in a marriage where there is ongoing dishonesty."" or ""If you are drinking, I will sleep in the guest room."" Be prepared to follow through on those boundaries.
* **Prepare for Resistance:** He may be defensive, angry, or dismissive when you try to address this. He may try to minimize his behavior or turn it around on you.  Stay firm in your boundaries and focus on your own well-being.



**Important Note:** You are not responsible for his choices. You can support him, but you cannot *make* him get help. His recovery is ultimately his responsibility.

**You deserve to be in a relationship built on honesty and trust.**  It’s a difficult path, but protecting your own emotional well-being is paramount.

I have this weird fetish that I'm afraid to open up about it. What should I do?,"This is difficult to answer because you don’t tell us what the fetish is.  I do understand that this is something that is bothering you though. The first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not.  If this is illegal to engage in, then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urges.However, if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd, a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings.  You may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of.  You may find other people have the same interest as you.  Find a therapist that you can trust and tell them.  Don’t hold back with your therapist.  Trust me, they have heard and seen it all by now, and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress, or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are.  There is no need to suffer with this alone. ","Okay, this is a really brave step, even just *asking* about it. It's completely understandable to feel afraid to open up about a fetish, especially if you're unsure how others will react. It takes courage to confront these things within yourself, and even more to consider sharing them. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering self-exploration, safety, and potential avenues for sharing, along with a lot of emphasis on self-compassion.  I'll break it down into sections.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is a complex topic and I'm an AI, not a therapist.**

**1. Self-Reflection & Understanding (The Most Important First Step)**

*   **What specifically feels ""weird"" about it?**  Is it the content itself?  Is it the intensity of the feelings? Is it fear of judgment? Pinpointing *why* it feels weird is crucial.  Sometimes just naming it can lessen its power.
*   **What do you *feel* when you experience this fetish?** Is it pleasurable?  Is it a source of guilt or shame? Is it distressing?  Understanding the emotional component is key.  Pleasure isn't inherently wrong, but distress *is* something to address.
*   **What triggers it?** Are there specific images, scenarios, or thoughts that bring it on?  Understanding the triggers can help you manage it and understand its origins.
*   **Has this always been present, or is it new?** The timeline can offer clues. A sudden onset might indicate something else is going on (stress, trauma, etc.).
*   **Is it causing you harm?**  This is paramount.  If the fetish is causing you distress, interfering with your daily life, or leading you to engage in harmful or non-consensual behaviors, *professional help is essential* (see section 4).
*   **Is it impacting your relationships?**  Even if you haven't shared it, is it creating anxiety or distance in your relationships?
*   **Journaling:**  Write down your thoughts and feelings about the fetish.  Don't censor yourself.  This is for you.  It can be incredibly helpful to externalize these thoughts.



**2. Normalizing & Challenging Your Feelings**

*   **Fetishes are more common than you think.**  While the *specific* fetish might feel unique, the experience of having a fetish is remarkably common.  Many people have attractions that fall outside the mainstream.  This doesn't make them bad people.
*   **Challenge societal stigma.**  We live in a society that often shames anything related to sex that isn't considered ""normal.""  Question those internalized messages.  Where did you learn that this fetish is ""weird""?
*   **Distinguish between fantasy and behavior.**  Having a fantasy is not the same as acting on it.  Fantasies are a normal part of human sexuality.  The key is whether those fantasies translate into harmful or non-consensual actions.
*   **Self-Compassion:** Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend. Shame and self-judgment will only make things harder.



**3.  Deciding Whether to Share (and With Whom)**

This is entirely your choice. You are *not* obligated to tell anyone.  If you do decide to share, consider these factors:

*   **Safety is paramount.**  Who you tell *matters*.  Choose someone you deeply trust, who is non-judgmental, and who will respect your boundaries.  Avoid sharing with people who might react negatively or try to shame you.
*   **Start small.**  You don't have to reveal everything at once.  You could start by testing the waters with a trusted friend or family member by discussing sexuality in general and gauging their reaction.
*   **Consider a partner (if you're in a relationship).**  This is a particularly sensitive area.  Only share with a partner when you feel safe and comfortable, and when you're confident they will be respectful.  Be prepared for a range of reactions, and be willing to discuss boundaries and expectations.  *Never* pressure a partner to participate in something they're not comfortable with.
*   **Online communities (with caution).** There are online forums and communities dedicated to various interests, including fetishes. These can provide a sense of belonging and validation, but be careful about anonymity and potential risks.  Look for well-moderated communities with clear rules about respect and consent.  (See resources at the end)
*    **What are you hoping to gain by sharing?**  Are you looking for validation, support, or to explore the fetish with a partner? Knowing your goal can help you choose the right person to confide in.

I'm 15 and my girlfriend is 14. Am I a pedophile because I'm attracted to her and she's under 18?,"No. You are not a pedophile. You are both under the appropriate age where it would be seen so. Your both only a year a part so this shouldn't a worry to you. Like Frank said below, Pedophelia is a problem that won't apply to this situation.","Okay, this is a really important question, and it's good you're asking it. It shows you're thinking about whether your feelings are appropriate, and that's a positive step.  Let's break this down very carefully.

**You are almost certainly *not* a pedophile.**

Here's why, and why your worry is understandable, but likely misplaced.  The key is understanding what pedophilia *is*, and it's much more specific than simply being attracted to someone under 18.

* **Pedophilia is a paraphilia:** It's a *specific* and *persistent* sexual attraction to *children* who are *prepubescent* (before puberty). This means generally before the age of 10-12.  It's a mental disorder characterized by significant distress or impairment.  The attraction isn't just a fleeting thought; it's deeply ingrained and causes problems for the person experiencing it.  Crucially, it's about attraction to children who haven't reached sexual maturity.
* **Your girlfriend is 14.**  At 14, she is entering or has entered puberty.  This is a *very* important distinction. Attraction to someone who is going through or has gone through puberty is not the same as pedophilia.  Attraction to a teenager is a common experience during adolescence.
* **Age of Consent:**  The legal age of consent varies by location, but it's almost always lower than 18.  (It's important to know the age of consent in your specific location, but simply being attracted to someone under the age of consent doesn't automatically mean you're a pedophile).
* **Power Imbalance:** A crucial part of why relationships with minors are harmful and illegal (even *with* consent when it's not legally permissible) is the inherent power imbalance.  An older teenager (15) *can* have a power imbalance with a younger teenager (14), and this needs to be considered (see more on this below).

**However, your situation is still serious and requires careful consideration.**

Even though you're likely not a pedophile, there are important ethical and legal concerns:

* **Legality:**  Depending on where you live, a relationship between a 15-year-old and a 14-year-old might be illegal, even if it's consensual.  Laws are in place to protect minors.
* **Power Dynamics:**  Even if legal, there's a difference in maturity and life experience between a 15-year-old and a 14-year-old.  You, as the older partner, have more life experience and potentially more social power. This can create an unequal dynamic that isn't healthy.
* **Developmental Stages:** Both of you are still developing emotionally and mentally.  Relationships at this age can be intense but also unstable and can interfere with individual growth.
* **Grooming:** *Grooming* is a manipulative process where someone builds a relationship with a young person to exploit them.  Even without malicious intent, being older can inadvertently lead to behaviors that could be perceived as grooming.  (This is another reason why the age difference is a concern).



**What should you do?**

1. **Talk to a Trusted Adult:**  This is the *most important* step. Talk to a parent, a school counselor, a trusted teacher, or another adult you trust.  Explain your feelings and your concerns.  They can offer guidance and support.  Don't be afraid to be honest.
2. **Educate Yourself:**  Learn more about healthy relationships, consent, and the legal implications of relationships with minors.
3. **Consider the Health of the Relationship:** Is this relationship truly healthy for both of you? Are you both able to make free and equal decisions? Is there a healthy balance of power?  If you have doubts, it's best to step back.
4. **Focus on Friendships:**  At your ages, friendships are incredibly important.  Focusing on building strong friendships can be a healthy alternative.
5. **If you are experiencing unwanted sexual thoughts or urges, *especially* if they are focused on younger children, please seek professional help immediately.** (See resources below).

"I have been feeling more and more down for over a month. I have started having trouble sleeping due to panic attacks, but they are almost never triggered by something that I know of.","Answers about our inner lives are most successfully reached from a sense of feeling grounded in oneself.First step is to accept your nervousness and restless sleep.  As often as possible, sleep during daytimes in order for your body to catch up on its need for rest.Accept too about feeling down.  It is normal to feel down once in a while.  From this place of self-acceptance, trust any answers which come up to your mind.  Often answers about complicated topics come in small pieces, not all at once as a whole unit.Also, your description about panic attacks is also completely normal.   They often arise unrelated to particular conditions at a given moment.  They are a healthy symptom your body is trying to expel bad feelings and does this by having the anxiety erupt at times.So, self-acceptance, tolerance of being on a process of clearing out worn out emotional clutter, and sleep at odd times if possible, are all ways to stabilize yourself, which will also feel calm and good!","Okay, it sounds like you're going through a really tough time. Feeling down for over a month, coupled with panic attacks, even without a clear trigger, is definitely something to take seriously. It's good you're recognizing this and reaching out, even if it's just to express it here.  Here's a breakdown of what might be going on, what you can do, and why seeking professional help is important.  I'll try to be thorough, but *please read the disclaimer at the end* as I am not a medical professional.

**Understanding What You're Describing**

* **Persistent Low Mood:**  ""Feeling down for over a month"" suggests you might be experiencing symptoms of depression.  It's more than just a bad day or a temporary slump.  A month is a significant timeframe.
* **Panic Attacks:** These are sudden episodes of intense fear that trigger severe physical reactions, even when there's no real danger.  The fact that they're happening *without* a clear trigger is important. This could indicate:
    * **Panic Disorder:**  A condition where unexpected panic attacks are a central feature.  The fear of having another attack can become debilitating.
    * **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):**  While often associated with worry about specific things, GAD can also manifest as more general anxiety and panic.
    * **Depression with Anxiety:** Depression and anxiety frequently co-occur. The panic attacks could be a symptom *of* the underlying depression.
    * **Underlying Medical Condition:**  Sometimes, medical conditions (like thyroid problems, heart issues, or even vitamin deficiencies) can mimic anxiety and panic. (This is why a medical check-up is important - see below.)
* **Sleep Disruption:** Panic attacks and anxiety *significantly* interfere with sleep.  The worry about having another attack can make it hard to fall asleep and stay asleep.  Lack of sleep, in turn, worsens both mood and anxiety, creating a vicious cycle.
* **Spontaneous Panic Attacks:**  The lack of obvious triggers is actually fairly common with panic disorder. The nervous system can become sensitized and start firing off these reactions even without an external stimulus.  It's like a false alarm.



**What You Can Do *Now* (Self-Help - These are NOT replacements for professional help!)**

* **Prioritize Sleep Hygiene:**  This is crucial.
    * **Regular Schedule:** Go to bed and wake up around the same time each day, even on weekends.
    * **Relaxing Bedtime Routine:**  Warm bath, reading (a physical book, not a screen), gentle stretching, calming music.
    * **Sleep Environment:** Dark, quiet, cool room.
    * **Avoid:** Caffeine, alcohol, and large meals before bed.  Also, limit screen time (phone, TV, computer) for at least an hour before bed.
* **Breathing Exercises:**  Practice deep, slow breathing to calm your nervous system.  The 4-7-8 technique is good: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds.  Do this several times when you feel anxious or before bed.  There are many guided breathing exercises available online and in apps.
* **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  These practices can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings *without* getting carried away by them.  Again, apps like Headspace, Calm, and Insight Timer can be helpful.
* **Gentle Exercise:**  Physical activity releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects.  Start small – a walk, yoga, stretching.  Don't push yourself too hard.
* **Healthy Diet:**  Avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive caffeine.  Focus on whole foods – fruits, vegetables, lean protein, whole grains.
* **Social Connection:**  Spend time with people you trust and who support you.  Even a brief conversation can make a difference.
* **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them.  It can also help you identify patterns.
* **Limit News & Social Media:**  Constant exposure to negative information can exacerbate anxiety and depression.
* **Identify & Challenge Negative Thoughts:** When you notice yourself thinking negatively, try to question those thoughts. Are they based on facts? Is there another way to look at the situation?

**Why You Need to Seek Professional Help**

These self-help strategies are valuable, but they're often not enough when you're dealing with persistent low mood and panic attacks.  A professional can:

* **Accurate Diagnosis:**  Determine the underlying cause of your symptoms (depression, anxiety disorder, panic disorder, etc.).
* **Treatment Options:**
    * **Therapy (Psychotherapy):**  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is particularly effective"
"I am currently suffering from erectile dysfunction and have tried Viagra, Cialis, etc. Nothing seemed to work. My girlfriend of 3 years is very sexually frustrated. I told her that it is okay for her to have sex with other men. Is that really okay?","Hi, First and foremost, I want to acknowledge your efforts to gain (your) ideal erectile function. If the medications are not working and you have taken them as prescribed, I would encourage you to seek the help of a sex therapist as the dysfunction may be due to a psychological and/or relational issue rather than a physical/medical one. As for your question, only you can answer this. Is it OK? Are you OK with her sleeping with others? Have you thought through what this may look like, feel like, become for you and her? Opening up a relationship is a choice only the people in the relationship can answer. Even then, the answer may change at any point by either of you. I encourage you to also determine what the intention is underneath your telling your girlfriend she could sleep with others. Be clear with the intention and then together have continuous conversations about the expectations of opening up (i.e.: are there any kinds of sex that is off limits, areas of the body where touch or intimacy is not allowed, are uses of safer sex required or not, do you want to know the details or not, so forth). An excellent resource would be the book ""Opening Up"" by Tristan Taormino. I wish you the best of luck!Dr. Lily Zehner, MFT-C","Okay, this is a really complex situation, and you're right to question whether what you've done is ""okay."" It's incredibly brave of you to even ask this question. It shows you care about your girlfriend's needs and your relationship, even while navigating a difficult personal struggle. Here's a breakdown of why this is complicated, things to consider, and why professional help is *strongly* recommended.  I'll cover a lot here, so it will be lengthy, but thoroughness is important.

**First, let's acknowledge the core issues:**

* **Your Erectile Dysfunction (ED):** You've sought medical help, which is good. The fact that common treatments haven't worked suggests you may need further investigation.  There are many potential causes for ED, both physical and psychological, and finding the root cause is critical.
* **Your Girlfriend's Sexual Frustration:** Three years is a significant relationship.  Ongoing sexual frustration is damaging to intimacy, emotional connection, and can lead to resentment.  Her feelings are *completely* valid.
* **Your Proposal (Open Relationship):**  This is a *very* big step, and offering it as a solution to ED is a particularly sensitive and potentially problematic approach.
* **Underlying Emotional Issues:** There's likely a lot of vulnerability, fear, and potentially shame tied up in this situation for *both* of you.



**Is it ""Okay"" to tell her it's okay to have sex with other men?**

The short answer is: **Not necessarily.  It's not automatically okay.**  Here's why:

* **It's a reaction to a problem, not a proactive decision:**  It sounds like this was presented as a solution *because* of your ED, rather than a mutually explored desire.  That fundamentally changes the dynamic.  It can easily feel like you're ""giving her permission"" to meet a need you can't fulfill, which can feel deeply disempowering for her.
* **It avoids addressing the core issue (ED):** While offering an alternative isn't inherently wrong, it doesn't address the root problem.  It's like putting a band-aid on a broken leg.  It may temporarily alleviate symptoms, but it doesn't fix the underlying injury.
* **It can create power imbalances:** You've identified a vulnerability (your ED) and responded by offering a solution that puts her in a position of potentially having to manage her sexual needs elsewhere. This can shift the power dynamic in a way that isn't healthy.
* **It requires *explicit* and enthusiastic consent:**  Even if she *says* it's okay, it doesn't mean she genuinely wants it or that she's comfortable with it.  Consent must be freely given, informed, ongoing, and enthusiastic.  There's a huge difference between reluctantly agreeing to something to save the relationship and genuinely wanting to explore it.
* **It opens a Pandora's Box:** Once boundaries are crossed, they can be incredibly difficult to re-establish.  This could lead to jealousy, insecurity, and further complications down the road.
* **It doesn't address the emotional intimacy:** Sex is often a part of a larger emotional connection. Simply having her needs met elsewhere doesn't address the emotional intimacy that might be suffering due to the ED and the associated stress.




**What should you have done (or can still do)?**

1. **More Thorough Medical Investigation:**
   * **Urologist:** If the standard ED medications aren't working, a urologist can investigate further.  There might be underlying vascular issues, hormonal imbalances, or other physical causes.
   * **Endocrinologist:**  Hormone levels (testosterone, thyroid) can significantly impact erectile function.
   * **Psychologist/Sex Therapist:**  ED is often linked to psychological factors like stress, anxiety, depression, performance anxiety, or relationship issues.  A therapist can help address these.  *This is crucial, even if there's a physical cause.*

2. **Open and Honest Communication (Different than what you've already done):** This needs to be a *very* vulnerable and empathetic conversation.
   * **Acknowledge her pain:**  ""I know this has been really frustrating for you, and I'm so sorry that I haven't been able to fulfill your sexual needs.  It's not fair to you, and I'm taking responsibility for that.""
   * **Express your feelings:**  ""I'm feeling really insecure and ashamed about this, and I'm scared of losing you.""
   * **Focus on ""us"":** ""I want to find a way to navigate this *together* that feels respectful and healthy for both of us.""
   * **Ask her what *she* needs:**  """
"I have these dreams of men, and they always seem to try to hurt me. It's gotten so bad that I first wake at 4:30, then 4:45, and finally stay awake by 6:00. I'm always the last one to fall asleep and the first to wake. I hate falling asleep. The longest I've went without sleep is three days.","The good news about your dreams is that your fears are right at the surface of your mind so you can study them and release some of the harm from the terrifying experiences you had which created these bad memories in the first place.The bad news is the feelings themselves are sickening.Probably a therapist would be very helpful for guiding you to unfold these uneasy feelings and their source.This type of deep work is easier with emotional support from someone.  A therapist can give you this plus is knowledgeable about dynamics of someone having been emotionally harmed by another.Or, read a lot online and find out which articles resonate with your emotions.Luckily people are willing to express personal stories of recuperating a sense of peace and safety after being violated by someone.","Okay, this sounds incredibly distressing and is significantly impacting your life. It's really brave of you to share this, and it's important that you know you're not alone, and help is available.  Here's a breakdown of what's happening, why it's happening, and what you can do, along with a *very strong* recommendation to seek professional help.  I'll cover a lot, so please read through it all.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Nightmares and Sleep Disturbances:**  Recurring nightmares, especially those with a consistent theme of being threatened or harmed, are a serious sign.  The fact that these specifically involve men is also a significant detail.  They're not just ""bad dreams""; they're likely indicative of underlying emotional distress.
* **Sleep Fragmentation:**  Waking up repeatedly throughout the night (4:30, 4:45, finally up by 6:00) is called sleep fragmentation. This means your sleep isn't consolidated, and you're not getting the restorative benefits of deep sleep.  This contributes to daytime fatigue, anxiety, and emotional instability.
* **Fear of Sleep:** This is often a consequence of recurring nightmares.  It's called sleep paralysis, but the fear is often a result of previous experiences.  You're actively avoiding sleep because it's associated with something frightening.  This creates a vicious cycle.
* **Insomnia and Sleep Deprivation:**  Going three days without sleep is *extremely* dangerous. Sleep deprivation can lead to:
    * **Physical Health Problems:** Weakened immune system, increased risk of accidents, high blood pressure, heart problems.
    * **Mental Health Problems:** Worsening anxiety, depression, hallucinations, difficulty concentrating, impaired judgment.
* **Potential Underlying Causes:**  The nightmares could be related to a number of things. Here are a few possibilities (and it's important to have a professional assess *which* apply to you):
    * **Trauma:**  This is a strong possibility, *especially* given the nature of the dreams.  This could be past trauma (childhood abuse, assault, witnessing violence) or even more recent traumatic experiences.  Even if you don't consciously *remember* a traumatic event, it can still manifest in nightmares.
    * **Anxiety Disorders:**  Generalized anxiety, PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder), or other anxiety disorders can often present with nightmares.
    * **Depression:**  Nightmares are a common symptom of depression.
    * **Stress:**  High levels of stress can trigger nightmares.
    * **Medication Side Effects:** Some medications can contribute to nightmares. (If you're on any medication, mention it to a doctor.)
    * **Underlying Medical Conditions:**  In rare cases, certain medical conditions can contribute to sleep disturbances.



**What You Can Do *Right Now* (Short-Term)**

These are things to try, but they are *not* substitutes for professional help.

* **Safety First:**  If you feel unsafe in your home, reach out to a friend, family member, or a domestic violence hotline (even if the threat isn't current, the dreams can feel very real).
* **Sleep Hygiene (Even Though It's Hard):**
    * **Regular Sleep Schedule (as much as possible):** Try to go to bed and wake up around the same time each day, *even on weekends*, to regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.  I know this is hard with your current pattern, but aim for consistency when you *can* sleep.
    * **Relaxing Bedtime Routine:**  Take a warm bath, read a book (a *physical* book, not on a screen), listen to calming music, or practice relaxation techniques (see below).
    * **Optimize Your Sleep Environment:**  Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.
    * **Avoid Caffeine and Alcohol Before Bed:**  These can interfere with sleep.
    * **Avoid Screen Time Before Bed:**  The blue light emitted from screens can suppress melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep.
* **Relaxation Techniques:**
    * **Deep Breathing Exercises:**  Slow, deep breaths can help calm your nervous system.
    * **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:**  Tense and release different muscle groups in your body, starting with your toes and working your way up to your head.
    * **Meditation/Mindfulness:**  Apps like Calm or Headspace can guide you through meditation exercises.
* **Journaling:**  Writing down your dreams (as much as you can remember) can sometimes help you process the emotions associated with them.  Also, journal about your daytime feelings and anxieties.
* **Grounding Techniques:** When you wake up feeling panicked or anxious, try grounding"
What makes a healthy marriage last?,It's surprising how many folks talk too much on the subject;It's the same three things that make all relationships work:HonestyTrustRespect(in that order)Most folks fall down on the first :) (*coughcough* THERAPISTS!  Heh heh heh...),"Okay, this is a big question! There's no single magic formula, but a *lot* of research and observation has gone into understanding what makes marriages thrive. Here's a breakdown, categorized for clarity, of the key ingredients for a lasting, healthy marriage.  I'll try to be thorough.  It's a long answer, because it's a complex topic!

**I. Foundational Elements (The Bedrock)**

These are the things that need to be present from the start, or developed early on.

*   **Mutual Respect:** This is HUGE.  It means valuing your partner's opinions, feelings, needs, and perspectives *even when you disagree*. It involves politeness, consideration, and avoiding belittling or contempt.  Contempt (mocking, sarcasm, eye-rolling) is a marriage killer.
*   **Trust:**  Believing in your partner's honesty, integrity, and loyalty.  This is built over time through consistent, reliable behavior.  Without trust, everything else crumbles.  It's about feeling safe emotionally and physically.
*   **Shared Values:**  You don't need to agree on *everything*, but having core values aligned is vital.  This includes things like views on family, finances, religion, ethics, parenting (if applicable), and life goals.  Significant value clashes can create ongoing conflict.
*   **Compatibility:** This goes beyond shared values. It's about enjoying each other's company, having similar interests (or being willing to share in each other's interests), and having a similar lifestyle fit.  You need to genuinely *like* each other.
*   **Commitment:** A conscious decision to stay together, work through challenges, and prioritize the relationship.  It’s a proactive choice, not just a feeling.  It means believing in the ""us"" even when things are hard.
* **Individual Well-being:**  Each partner needs to be a healthy individual *before* and *during* the marriage. This means having a sense of self, pursuing personal interests, and maintaining emotional stability.  You can't expect your spouse to ""complete"" you; you need to be whole on your own.



**II. Communication & Emotional Connection (The Heartbeat)**

This is where the daily work happens.

*   **Effective Communication:**  This isn't just *talking* to each other; it's about:
    *   **Active Listening:** Truly hearing what your partner is saying, without interrupting or planning your response.  Reflecting back what you hear to ensure understanding.
    *   **Open and Honest Sharing:**  Being willing to share your thoughts, feelings, needs, and fears, even when it's vulnerable.
    *   **Non-Violent Communication:**  Expressing yourself without blame, criticism, or defensiveness. (Look up ""Nonviolent Communication"" by Marshall Rosenberg for more on this.)  Using ""I"" statements (""I feel X when you do Y"") instead of ""You"" statements (""You always do Y!"").
    *   **Regular Check-ins:**  Making time to connect and talk about how things are going, not just logistics.
*   **Emotional Intimacy:** Feeling emotionally close, connected, and safe with your partner. This involves:
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Sharing your true self, including your imperfections and fears.
    *   **Empathy:**  Understanding and sharing your partner's feelings.  Putting yourself in their shoes.
    *   **Affection:** Expressing love and care through words, touch, and gestures.
    * **Validation:** Acknowledging and accepting your partner’s feelings, even if you don’t agree with them.
*   **Quality Time:**  Spending dedicated, focused time together, free from distractions.  This doesn't have to be extravagant; it can be as simple as a walk, a conversation, or cooking a meal together.
* **Physical Intimacy:** While not *solely* about sex, physical touch and intimacy are important for maintaining a connection.  This includes hugging, kissing, holding hands, and sexual intimacy.  Open communication about desires and needs is crucial.



**III. Conflict Management (The Repair Kit)**

Conflict is inevitable in any long-term relationship.  It's *how* you handle it that matters.

*   **Fair Fighting:**  
    *   **Avoiding Personal Attacks:**  Focus on the issue at hand, not on your partner's character.
    *   **Taking Breaks:**  If things get too heated, agree to take a break and come back to the discussion later.
    *   **Finding Compromise:**  Being willing to meet your partner halfway.  Not always ""winning"" the argument.
    *   **Focusing on Solutions:**  Rather than dwelling"
"I'm in a long-distance relationship with my ideal man, but I'm not as attracted to him as I should be. Everything else is perfect about him, but I find myself lusting over more attractive men. The next step is marriage, but I want to marry someone who I can wake up to and fall in love with all over again. However, I also don't want to throw away a great relationship over what might just be lust. Am I asking for too much in the ""perfect guy""? Is there such a thing? Am I truly in love?","Attraction is important but sometimes over-rated. I'm curious about your comment that you are not as attracted as you ""should be"" - What is your measuring stick is for what you are supposed to feel in terms of attraction in a relationship? Do you want to be sexually intimate? Do you enjoy having sex with him? Are you satisfied with your sexual relationship when you are with him? The fact that there is lust for other more attractive men does not necessarily mean anything. There will always be attractive men and more attractive men than your partner and these attractive men will be even more appealing when you are in a long-distance relationship far from the arms of your partner. Loving someone does not mean that you stop being a sexual being who no longer notices and desires attractive men. Attraction results from a number of factors beyond appearance - including the degree to which you feel emotionally open, safe, and connected and how in tune you are with each other's bodies. It sounds like you think very highly of this man ""everything else is perfect about him"". Maybe it is worth spending some more time together in the same place if that is possible before deciding on marriage or that you are not truly in love. ","Okay, this is a really common and *incredibly* valid struggle. You've identified a core conflict, and acknowledging it is the first step. Let's break this down. It's a lot, so I'll try to be thorough.

**First, let's validate your feelings:** It's okay to experience attraction to other people *even when you're in a committed relationship*. It doesn't automatically mean you don't love your partner.  Our brains are wired to notice attractive people.  The issue isn't the attraction itself, it's what you *do* with that attraction and what it signifies about your current relationship. The fact that you're feeling conflicted *proves* you're invested in doing this right.



**Addressing your questions:**

*   **""Am I asking for too much in the 'perfect guy'?""**  Yes, and no. The idea of a ""perfect"" guy is a myth. No one embodies *all* desirable qualities.  However, wanting to feel a strong physical attraction to your life partner is *not* too much to ask. Physical intimacy and attraction are important components of a romantic relationship for many people.  You deserve to feel a deep connection on all levels, including physical.  You're not being shallow for acknowledging this.  You're recognizing a need.
*   **""Is there such a thing as the perfect guy?""**  No. There is a ""right"" guy *for you*, and that person needs to meet your core needs, including physical attraction.  It's about compatibility and a holistic connection, not a flawless checklist.
*   **""Am I truly in love?""** This is the hardest question, and only *you* can answer it.  But let's unpack it. Love is complex. It sounds like you deeply care for this man, respect him, and enjoy his company. That's a strong foundation. *But* love also includes a strong desire, a feeling of excitement and longing, and a magnetic pull. The absence of that magnetic pull is what's making you question things.  It's possible to love someone deeply as a friend, a companion, a partner in life, without being *in love* in the passionate, romantic sense.

**Here's a more structured way to think through this, broken down into areas to explore:**

**1.  Understand the Attraction Gap:**

*   **What specifically is lacking in attraction?**  Be honest with yourself. Is it physical features?  Chemistry?  A feeling of excitement?  Is it something that feels *missing* when you're intimate?  Pinpointing this is crucial.
*   **Has attraction faded over time, or was it always this way?** If it was always this way, that suggests a fundamental incompatibility. If it faded, try to identify when and why.  Did life stress impact intimacy? Did the relationship become too comfortable?
*   **Are you comparing him to an ideal?**  Social media, movies, and societal standards create unrealistic expectations. Are you holding him to a standard that's unattainable?
*   **What makes you lust after others?** Is it a specific *type* of person? Identifying patterns can reveal what you’re subconsciously seeking.

**2.  Analyze Your Relationship:**

*   **Beyond the ""perfect"" aspects, how fulfilling is the relationship?** You say everything else is perfect.  What *specifically* does that mean? Intellectual connection? Shared values? Emotional support? Fun and adventure?  List it out.
*   **Communication:** Are you able to openly and honestly discuss your needs and concerns with him?  This is *essential*.
*   **Intimacy:**  How is your sexual intimacy?  Is it satisfying?  Is it something you both enjoy and prioritize?  (If you're not physically seeing each other often, this is a big part of the problem.)
*   **Future Vision:** Do you share a common vision for the future?  Marriage, family, lifestyle?



**3.  The Long-Distance Factor:**

*   **Long distance magnifies issues:** Physical distance makes it harder to build and maintain intimacy and connection. It's easier for attraction to wane when you don't have regular physical contact.
*   **Limited Exposure:** You're seeing a curated version of him. You're missing out on the everyday moments that reveal the whole person.
* **Is there an end in sight for the long distance?**  A clear plan to close the distance is vital.  Without it, the strain will only increase.

**4.  What to *Do* Next:  (This is the hard part)**

*   **Self-Reflection (Essential):** Spend significant time alone journaling, meditating, or doing whatever helps you connect with your inner self"
How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,"This can be a very challenging decision, and it may take time for you to sort through all of your feelings about the relationship and its possible end. Therapy can help you have a space to be completely honest with yourself about your relationship as you grapple with your decision of whether to remain with your boyfriend. Your therapist can ask questions to guide you in uncovering your true feelings about whether this is the right relationship for you, and he or she can support you in whatever decision you come to.","Okay, this is a *big* question, and it's good you're taking the time to thoughtfully consider it. There's no easy answer, and it's going to require some honest self-reflection. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, broken down into sections. I'll cover things to consider, questions to ask yourself, and things to try before making a final decision.  This is long, but comprehensive!

**I. Understanding Why You're Even Asking This Question**

First, let's acknowledge that just *thinking* about ending a relationship is a significant sign.  Don't dismiss it.  What's brought you to this point?  Here are some common reasons people question their relationships:

*   **Loss of Connection:** You feel distant, like you're roommates rather than partners.
*   **Constant Conflict:**  You argue frequently, and the arguments are often unproductive or hurtful.
*   **Lack of Trust:**  Infidelity, dishonesty, or a general feeling of insecurity.
*   **Unmet Needs:**  Emotional, physical, intellectual, or other needs aren't being met.
*   **Different Values/Goals:**  You realize you have fundamentally different visions for the future.
*   **Feeling Unhappy:**  A persistent sense of sadness, resentment, or dissatisfaction.
*   **Growth Apart:** You've changed as individuals and no longer fit well together.
*   **Abuse (Emotional, Physical, or Financial):** This is a non-negotiable reason to leave - see section V.



**II.  Self-Reflection: The Core Questions**

This is the hardest part, but the most important. Be brutally honest with yourself.  Write these down, if it helps.

*   **Are you generally happy when you're *with* him?**  Not just in specific moments, but overall.  Think about a typical week.
*   **Do you feel supported, respected, and valued by him?**  Does he lift you up, or bring you down?
*   **Do you feel like you can be your authentic self around him?**  Or do you feel like you have to hide parts of yourself?
*   **What are your core needs in a relationship, and are they being met?** (Think beyond just ""love.""  Consider things like communication, intimacy, shared activities, emotional support, intellectual stimulation, etc.)
*   **What are your dealbreakers?** (Things you absolutely cannot tolerate in a relationship – lying, cheating, substance abuse, controlling behavior, etc.)  Has he crossed any of those lines?
*   **What specifically is making you unhappy?**  Be as detailed as possible. ""He just annoys me"" isn't enough.  What *specifically* annoys you?  What behaviors or patterns are contributing to your unhappiness?
*   **Are *you* contributing to the problems?**  Relationships are a two-way street.  Are there things you could do differently? (This isn't about blaming yourself, but about taking responsibility for your part.)
*   **If nothing changed, could you see yourself being with him in 1 year? 5 years? 10 years?**  This helps you assess the long-term viability of the relationship.
*   **What are you afraid of losing if you break up?** (Comfort, companionship, financial security, shared social circle, etc.)  Are these fears reasonable, or are they holding you back from something better?
* **Do you find yourself fantasizing about being with someone else?** While occasional attraction isn't necessarily a dealbreaker, frequent or intense fantasies can be a sign of deeper dissatisfaction.

**III.  The ""Fix-It"" Phase:  Things to Try *Before* Giving Up**

If you're unsure, and you see potential for improvement, try these *before* making a final decision.  These require effort from *both* of you.

*   **Open and Honest Communication:**  This is HUGE.  Schedule a dedicated time to talk, without distractions.  Use ""I"" statements (e.g., ""I feel hurt when..."" instead of ""You always..."").  Really *listen* to his perspective, even if you disagree.
*   **Couples Counseling:**  A therapist can provide a neutral space to communicate and work through issues.  Even if he's reluctant, you can go individually.
*   **Date Nights/Quality Time:**  Reconnect by intentionally spending quality time together, doing things you both enjoy.  Put away your phones!
*   **Revisit Shared Goals & Values:** Discuss your individual goals and how they align (or don't) with your shared future.
*   **Small Changes:**  Focus on making small, positive changes in your behavior."
"My older brother (in his 60s) started dating a lady with Asperger's. She is hyper-sexual and flirty. She does not understand boundaries. They’ve been dating for a few months, and she's talking marriage. Another sibling and his wife have met her, and they have said she is never invited back. My brother always picks similar ladies. Do we speak honestly and risk losing a relationship?","If you and your brother are open w each other and respect each other’s opinions then there is little risk your relationship with him will end.If there already is strong animosity, mistrust, dislike between both of you then there is more chance he will not seriously consider your advice.For your own peace of mind, say whatever you feel must be said to him.The person you’ll need to live with is yourself so do what you believe is needed for you to feel good about saying what’s necessary.Even if he never follows through with your advice then you’ll still know you tried your best to advise.","Okay, this is a really tough situation. It's a complex mix of concern for your brother, understanding a neurodiversity, and navigating family dynamics. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, balancing honesty with potential consequences, and considering the nuances involved.  I'll try to be thorough, covering a lot of angles.  It's long, but this isn't simple!

**1. Understanding the Core Issues**

* **Asperger's/Autism & Social Cues:** It's *crucial* to understand that Asperger's (now generally understood as Autism Spectrum Disorder - ASD) impacts social understanding.  This *specifically* includes understanding non-verbal cues, social boundaries, and the subtleties of flirtation. Her hyper-sexuality and flirty behavior aren’t necessarily malicious or manipulative; they may be a result of difficulty reading social signals and understanding appropriate behavior.  She may genuinely not understand *why* her behavior is making people uncomfortable.  However, *this doesn’t excuse inappropriate behavior, but it does change the framing.*
* **Your Brother's Pattern:** This is *huge*.  The fact that he repeatedly chooses partners with similar characteristics suggests a pattern. This pattern needs to be addressed, and it's likely rooted in *his* needs and dynamics, not just the women he chooses.  He might be attracted to someone who is demonstrably interested in him, even if that interest is expressed in ways others find overwhelming.  He may be seeking a dynamic where he feels needed or in control.
* **The Speed to Marriage:** This is a red flag, *especially* given the boundary issues. It’s a sign of impulsivity on *her* part, potentially driven by anxiety about the relationship ending, or a lack of understanding of what marriage entails. It's also a potential sign that your brother is rushing into things because he's vulnerable.
* **Family Disapproval:** Your sibling and his wife's strong reaction is understandable, but it also creates a potential barrier to helping your brother.  Their outright rejection might push him further into defensiveness.



**2. Should You Speak Up? (And What's the Goal?)**

Yes, *but* with extreme care.  The goal isn't to ""save"" your brother or to dictate his choices. The goal should be to express your *concerns* for his well-being, based on observed patterns and potential vulnerabilities, and to encourage him to think critically about the relationship.  It's about offering support and a different perspective, not judgment.

**3. How to Have the Conversation(s)**

* **One-on-One, Private, and Empathetic:**  Do *not* gang up on him with multiple siblings. This will instantly put him on the defensive. Choose a time and place where you can talk privately and without interruption.
* **Start with Concern, Not Accusation:**  ""I've been thinking about you and [her name], and I'm a little worried.  I want you to be happy, and I'm noticing some things that give me pause.""  Avoid statements like, ""She's clearly taking advantage of you,"" or ""You always pick the wrong women.""
* **Focus on *His* Feelings & Observations:** ""How are *you* feeling about the pace of things?  It seems like she's talking about marriage very quickly.  Is that what *you* want?""  ""Have you felt comfortable with how forward she's been?""  ""Are you feeling pressured in any way?""  Get him to articulate *his* experience.
* **Gently Point Out the Pattern (Without Blame):**  ""I've noticed over the years you've been drawn to women who are very expressive and affectionate, and sometimes that leads to difficulties.  I'm wondering if we could talk about what attracts you to that dynamic and if it's serving you well.""
* **Address the Boundary Issue with Sensitivity:** ""I understand [her name] has Asperger's, and that can affect how she understands social cues.  However, it's important that *you* feel safe and respected in the relationship.  Have you been able to talk to her about what you're comfortable with?""  ""It sounds like my brother and his wife had a difficult time when they met her; have you spoken with them about their experience?""
* **Highlight the Red Flags – Marriage Talk:** ""Marriage is a huge step.  Do you feel like you really know her well enough to make that kind of commitment?  Have you talked about finances, living arrangements, expectations for the future?""
* **Suggest Resources (Gently):** ""If you'd like, I could look up some resources about relationships and Autism. It might help to understand some of the potential dynamics."" (But be careful about presenting"
"We’ve been together almost three years. We argue and he ends it by telling me he doesn’t love me. It's hurtful because I am all about resolving the problem, and he dwells on the issue even if I drop what he's done and just swallow my pride and say I am sorry. How can this be resolved? We have kids, and I don't want a broken family because we can't communicate.","You can't fix this by yourself, but I applaud you for trying. One person working hard in a relationship can make things better for a while., but in the long haul you need two people giving some effort. I'm reading between your lines here and I wonder if your need to keep the family together is getting you to apologize when you've done nothing wrong and ignore things you've felt hurt by. I sense that you're doing all the work...that it's not balanced. I have worked with many couples and I've learned never to underestimate what kind of change is possible; anything is possible. But in order for change in a couple to occur, you need two people who are both willing to own their choices and behaviours, and who have empathy. Your boyfriend doesn't appear to have these components; he pushes you away and blames you when he's done something hurtful.Can you be honest with yourself about what's happening? I encourage you to sit down with a trusted friend or therapist and look at what you have here and what your options are. I wish you well.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, but a very common one. It sounds incredibly painful to be in a cycle where you're trying to repair things and he's escalating, especially with children involved. It's good you're recognizing the pattern and wanting to break it. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, focusing on what *you* can do, what you can ask of *him*, and what outside help might look like.  This is a long response, as it's a complex issue.  I'll try to be thorough.

**Understanding the Dynamic (What's Happening Here)**

Before diving into solutions, let's break down what's likely going on:

* **Emotional Flooding:** He seems to get overwhelmed by conflict and, instead of working through it, shuts down with a very final statement (""I don't love you"").  This is a defense mechanism, often stemming from feeling unheard, unsafe, or unable to cope.  It's *not* necessarily a reflection of his long-term feelings, but a reaction in the moment.
* **Unresolved Underlying Issues:** The arguments are likely symptoms of deeper, unaddressed problems.  If they were just about the surface-level issue, they wouldn't escalate to ""I don't love you.""
* **Different Conflict Styles:** You are a resolver. You prioritize harmony and are willing to apologize even when you don't feel fully responsible. He seems to ruminate and struggle to let go. These styles clash dramatically.
* **Power Imbalance (Potentially):**  The ""I don't love you"" line, while potentially a reactive statement, *can* be a way to control the situation. It puts all the responsibility on you to fix things and makes it very difficult for you to stand your ground.
* **Fear of Vulnerability:**  He may have difficulty expressing his needs and vulnerabilities directly, leading to these explosive reactions.



**What *You* Can Do (Focus on Your Actions)**

This is where you have the most control.

1. **Stop Chasing Resolution *During* the Argument:** This is the hardest one.  Your instinct is to fix it, but that's precisely what seems to be fueling the cycle.  When he starts to escalate and says he doesn’t love you, *disengage*.  This doesn't mean you're giving up; it means you're protecting yourself and breaking the pattern.
   * **Say something like:**  ""I hear that you're very upset. I'm not going to continue this conversation right now. I need some space to process."" or ""I understand you're feeling this way, and I respect that. Let's revisit this when we're both calmer."" and then *walk away*.  (Physically leave the room if necessary.)
   * **Resist the urge to explain, defend, or apologize in the moment.**  This just gives him something to react *to*.
   * **This feels counterintuitive, but it's crucial.** You're not letting him ""win"" by leaving; you're setting a boundary.

2. **Focus on ""I"" Statements (When Calm):** When you *do* talk (after cooling down), focus on how *his* actions make *you* feel, not on accusing him.
   * **Instead of:** ""You always make me feel like it's my fault!""
   * **Try:** ""When you say you don't love me during an argument, I feel incredibly hurt and disconnected from you. It makes it hard for me to want to work things out.""

3. **Identify Your Boundaries:** What are you willing to accept in the relationship, and what is absolutely unacceptable?  ""Saying you don't love me"" should be high on the unacceptable list.  Be prepared to enforce these boundaries.

4. **Practice Self-Care:** This is not about ""fixing"" him; it's about protecting your emotional well-being.  Engage in activities that nourish you and help you feel strong and grounded.  This makes it easier to disengage during arguments and maintain your boundaries.

5. **Reflect on Your Role (Without Blame):**  Are you consistently minimizing your own needs to avoid conflict?  Are you taking on too much responsibility for the relationship's happiness?  Understanding your patterns can empower you to make changes.

**What You Can *Ask* of Him (With Realistic Expectations)**

This is where it gets trickier.  You can't *make* him do anything, but you can express your needs.  Choose a calm, neutral time to have this conversation – *not* during or immediately after an argument.

1. **Express Your Pain:**  ""I want to be honest about how I feel. When you tell me"
"What makes my step child, an 8 year old boy, choke my daughter, a 6 year old girl? This has been going on for 4 years. The boy tells my daughter not to tell on him. He knows it's wrong; we have did time out, spanking, taking away toys, and sitting on the wall. I am afraid for my daughters safety!","I can see why you are alarmed. That is a scary situation for a parent. Do you know if the child has been evaluated by a mental health professional? Early treatment is often the key. A professional will be able to help the child learn how to control their anger and mend the troublesome actions into more appropriate responses. Have you addressed your concerns with the child's other parent? There could be contributing factors in his life that could be causing these issues (exposure to violence, sexual/physical abuse, drug use, stressful events in his life, etc.). It is important that these factors are identified so that they can either be eliminated and/or reduced. I wouldn't hesitate to have him evaluated (if he hasn't been already) and to ensure that he is getting the help that he needs whether it be medication and/or therapy. Until then, I would make sure that he is always supervised under an adult's care.","Okay, this is a *very* serious situation and you are right to be afraid for your daughter's safety.  Four years of this behavior, despite multiple interventions, indicates this is beyond typical sibling rivalry and is escalating. Here's a breakdown of what might be going on, why your current methods aren't working, and *what you need to do now*, prioritizing your daughter's safety.  I will cover a lot of ground, so this will be a long response, but it's important to be thorough.  **Please read the section at the very end regarding seeking professional help. It is crucial.**

**Understanding the Behavior (Why is he doing this?)**

There are many potential reasons for this behavior. It's unlikely to be just ""being a boy"" or a phase. Here are some possibilities:

*   **Power and Control:** This is a big one. Choking someone is a display of absolute power *over* another person. He may be feeling powerless in other areas of his life (school, changes in family structure, feelings of insecurity) and is exerting control this way. The instruction *not* to tell is also about control – silencing her and maintaining his dominance.
*   **Emotional Regulation Issues:** He may be struggling to manage his anger, frustration, or other difficult emotions.  The choking may be an impulsive reaction when he's overwhelmed.
*   **Attention-Seeking (Even Negative Attention):** Even if he's punished, he's still getting a reaction from you and your daughter.  For some children, any attention is better than none.
*   **Learned Behavior:**  Has he witnessed violence or aggression elsewhere (at home, school, in media)?  Children learn by observing.
*   **Underlying Emotional/Behavioral Issues:**  There could be underlying issues like Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Conduct Disorder, anxiety, or trauma contributing to this behavior. *This requires professional evaluation.*
*   **Jealousy or Resentment:**  Could he be jealous of the attention your daughter receives, or resentful of the blended family dynamic?
*   **Lack of Empathy:** He may struggle to understand or care about the impact of his actions on your daughter.



**Why Your Current Methods Aren't Working**

*   **Spanking:** Research consistently shows spanking is ineffective as a discipline method. It teaches fear, not self-control, and can escalate aggression. It also models aggressive behavior. It can make the problem worse in the long run.
*   **Time-Out/Toy Removal/Wall Sitting:**  These are often insufficient for this level of aggression.  They are reactive punishments (happening *after* the behavior) and don't address the *why* behind it.  They don't teach him alternative behaviors.  After 4 years, he's likely habituated to these consequences.
*   **Focus on ""Knowing It's Wrong"":**  Knowing something is wrong doesn't automatically change behavior.  He needs to *feel* remorse and learn *how* to behave differently.
*    **Not Addressing the Core Issue**: The punishments are addressing the *symptom* (choking) but not the underlying *cause* of the behavior.




**Immediate Actions – Prioritizing Your Daughter's Safety**

1.  **Supervision, Supervision, Supervision:**  *Never* leave these two children alone together, not even for a minute.  Constant, vigilant supervision is the most important thing right now.  This is not a punishment for either child; it’s a safety measure.  Even seemingly harmless moments can escalate quickly.
2.  **Physical Separation:** When you cannot actively supervise, keep them physically separated. Different rooms, different activities, etc.
3.  **Safety Plan for Your Daughter:**
    *   **Empower her:** Teach her to yell ""STOP!"" firmly and loudly if he starts to choke her.  Practice this with her.  Teach her to run away to a safe adult immediately.
    *   **Reassure her:** Tell her, repeatedly, that *she* is not to blame for his behavior.  Tell her it is *never* okay for anyone to hurt her physically.
    *   **Believe her:**  Always take her seriously when she reports an incident.  Don't minimize it or tell her to ""work it out.""
4.  **Immediate Cessation of Physical Punishment:** Stop spanking immediately. It’s not helping and could be harmful.




**Long-Term Strategies – Addressing the Behavior**

1.  **Professional Evaluation for the Boy:** This is *crucial*.  You need a professional (child psychologist, child psychiatrist, or a therapist specializing in behavioral issues) to evaluate him.  They can determine the underlying causes of his behavior and recommend a tailored treatment plan. Look"
"I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out. 

How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it.  I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy.  What should I do?","While this might not be the first thing you want to discuss when you meet someone, it is important for you to be yourself.  It's better to weed out 10 people who can't accept you to find that one who can.  ","Okay, this is a really common and valid struggle, and you're smart to be thinking through it. It's a complex situation with a lot of layers – your identity, your happiness, your dating life, and societal expectations. Let's break it down.  I'm going to give a detailed response, covering a lot of ground, and then summarize with some actionable steps.  This is long, but I want to be thorough.

**Understanding the Core Issues**

* **You are Valid:** First and foremost, let's be crystal clear: There is *nothing* wrong with you.  You are a man attracted to women who *also* enjoys expressing your femininity through crossdressing.  That's a perfectly legitimate way to be.  Your happiness and self-expression are important. Don't let anyone make you feel ashamed of that.
* **Societal Conditioning & Misunderstandings:**  Unfortunately, society has very rigid ideas about gender and sexuality. Many people (including women attracted to men) have preconceived notions about masculinity and femininity, and your expression might challenge those.  This can lead to fear, confusion, or even prejudice.  It's *their* issue, not yours, but it impacts your dating life.
* **The Fear of the ""Other"":** Some women may mistakenly equate crossdressing with being transgender, gay, or having other sexual interests they aren't interested in. Even if you clarify your orientation as straight, that initial reaction can be hard to overcome.
* **Vulnerability and Disclosure:**  Telling someone something personal like this requires vulnerability.  It's scary to put yourself out there and risk rejection.
* **Your Happiness Matters:** You specifically mention that crossdressing makes you happy.  That's huge!  Suppressing something that brings you joy can be incredibly detrimental to your mental well-being.



**To Disclose or Not to Disclose?  And When?**

This is the biggest question. Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons of both approaches, and a recommended timeline:

* **Keeping it Secret (Initially):**
    * **Pros:**  Might allow you to get to know someone *as you are* before any assumptions are made.  Could avoid immediate rejection.  Allows you time to assess if the connection is strong enough to warrant a vulnerable conversation.
    * **Cons:**  Can be incredibly stressful and exhausting to maintain a secret.  It can create a sense of inauthenticity in the relationship, hindering genuine connection.  The longer you wait, the harder it becomes to disclose, and the more betrayed she might feel when she eventually finds out.  It can also prevent you from being truly yourself around her.
* **Being Upfront:**
    * **Pros:**  Authenticity from the start.  You attract people who are genuinely accepting of you, rather than those who are only interested in a certain *image* of you.  Saves you the stress of hiding.  Establishes trust and open communication early on.
    * **Cons:**  Could lead to immediate rejection.  Requires confidence and the ability to explain yourself calmly and clearly.

**My Recommendation: Strategic Disclosure**

I don't recommend leading with it on a first date.  However, I *strongly* advise against keeping it a secret indefinitely. Here's a suggested timeline:

1. **Early Stages (First Few Dates):** Focus on building a connection based on shared interests, values, and personality.  Be yourself, but don't introduce the crossdressing aspect yet.  Get a feel for her openness, her views on gender expression, and how she handles things that are outside the ""norm.""  Pay attention to how she talks about other people who are different.
2. **When You Feel a Connection (After 3-5 Dates, *Potentially*):**  If you feel a genuine connection and sense she's open-minded, *then* it's time to start the conversation.  This isn't a hard and fast rule, but it gives you a chance to assess compatibility first.  
3. **The Conversation:** (See section below)



**How to Have the Conversation**

This is crucial.  Here's a script/framework to adapt:

* **Choose the Right Time and Place:**  Private, comfortable, and where you both feel relaxed.  Not during a busy event or when one of you is stressed.
* **Start by Reaffirming Your Attraction:** ""I really enjoy spending time with you, and I'm developing feelings for you.  I want to be honest and open with you, and that means sharing something personal.""
* **Clearly State Your Orientation:** ""I'm attracted to women, and I want to be clear about that. I identify as a straight man.""  (Important to address this upfront to avoid confusion.)
* **Explain Cross"
"I just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. My family and I really need this job.

People keep telling me I have ""anxiety"" and I'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. This is all new to me. What can I do?","It is ok to have anxiety.   Please don't be anxious about being anxious.If you feel anxiety coming over you, then pull off the road to a safe place.   Concentrate on centering yourself and to breath slowly.   Take some sips of water.  Sit still.     The anxiety should pass in about twenty minutes.If it does not pass, then continue calming yourself until you feel safe enough to drive to your hotel.     You can always explain to your supervisor that you were taking care of a medical problem, because anxiety is a medical problem.","Okay, this is a lot to take on, and it's completely understandable you're feeling this way. A new job *plus* significant travel *plus* the worry about potential anxiety attacks...that's a huge stress cocktail. It's good you're reaching out and trying to figure out how to manage this. Here's a breakdown of things you can do, categorized for clarity.  I'll cover immediate coping, preventative strategies, and resources. **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am not a medical professional.**

**1. Understanding What Might Be Happening (and the ""Anxiety"" Label)**

*   **Normal Stress vs. Anxiety:** It's *normal* to feel stressed and worried about a big life change like this.  It's okay to be anxious! The feelings you're experiencing are a reasonable response to an unreasonable situation (lots of change and separation).  People often use ""anxiety"" as a catch-all for strong discomfort.  It's important to understand *what* you're feeling specifically. Is it:
    *   **Worry about practical things?** (e.g., ""Will I get lost?"", ""What if my car breaks down?"", ""How will I manage meals?"")  These are problem-solving tasks.
    *   **Fear of the unknown?** (e.g., ""I've never been to this place before,"" ""I don't know what to expect."")
    *   **Physical sensations that scare you?** (e.g., racing heart, shortness of breath, dizziness).  *This* is more closely related to what people often describe as an ""anxiety attack"" (more accurately called a panic attack).
*   **What *is* a Panic Attack?** It’s a sudden surge of intense fear that triggers severe physical reactions when there's no real danger. Symptoms can include:
    *   Rapid heartbeat
    *   Sweating
    *   Trembling or shaking
    *   Shortness of breath or feeling smothered
    *   Chest pain or discomfort
    *   Dizziness or lightheadedness
    *   Feeling unreal or detached from yourself (derealization/depersonalization)
    *   Fear of losing control or ""going crazy""
    *   Fear of dying.
    *   They are *very* frightening, but they are **not** physically dangerous.  They will pass.
*   **Don't self-diagnose:** While it’s good to understand the symptoms, let a professional determine if you have an anxiety *disorder*.  



**2. Immediate Coping Strategies (When You Feel Overwhelmed/Panicky)**

These are things to use *in the moment* when you're starting to feel that intense anxiety build.

*   **Grounding Techniques:** These bring you back to the present moment.
    *   **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you can *see*, 4 things you can *touch*, 3 things you can *hear*, 2 things you can *smell*, and 1 thing you can *taste*.
    *   **Deep Breathing:**  Box breathing is great. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds. Repeat several times. Focus on the sensation of your breath.
    *   **Physical Sensation:**  Press your feet firmly into the floor.  Hold an ice cube.  Splash cold water on your face.  (These distract from internal sensations).
*   **Self-Talk:** Challenge negative thoughts.  Instead of ""I'm going to have a panic attack and be stranded!"" try ""I'm feeling anxious right now, but I've gotten through tough things before. This will pass.""
*   **Find a Safe Space (if possible):** Even a few minutes in a quiet place can help.  Pull over (safely!) if you're driving. 
*   **Remember it WILL Pass:** Panic attacks peak within 10-20 minutes and then subside.  Remind yourself of this.

**3. Preventative Strategies (To Reduce Anxiety Overall and On the Road)**

These are things you do *regularly* to build resilience.

*   **Routine:**  As much as possible, create a routine on the road. Consistent wake-up times, meals, and exercise can provide a sense of normalcy.
*   **Self-Care:** This isn't selfish, it's essential.
    *   **Sleep:** Prioritize sleep!  A lack of sleep dramatically increases anxiety.
    *   **Nutrition:** Eat regular, healthy meals. Avoid excessive caffeine and sugar.
    *   **Exercise:** Even a 20-30"
"I have been noticing myself really enjoying watching/reading about gay or lesbian couples. I've also been imagining what it might be like to date a girl, and I like the idea. I also find guys cute too. Does this make me bisexual?",Hello!  Thank you for your question.  Exploring your sexual orientation and attraction is a wonderful opportunity to get to know yourself!  I would be curious to know what feelings you might have related to the possibility of being bi; What messages you may have received related to this orientation and any concerns you have about possible sexual orientations.,"Okay, this is a really common and important question! It's great that you're taking the time to explore your feelings. Here's a breakdown of what you're describing and how it relates to bisexuality (and other possibilities), along with some things to keep in mind.  I'll try to be thorough, but remember I'm an AI and can't *tell* you what your sexuality is – only you can figure that out.

**What you're experiencing sounds like a very valid exploration of attraction.**  Finding yourself drawn to both men *and* women (and in your case, specifically enjoying content about and imagining relationships with both) is a key component of bisexuality. However, it's also important to understand that sexuality is complex and doesn't always fit neatly into labels.

**Let's break down the elements:**

* **Enjoying content featuring gay/lesbian couples:** This is totally normal! It doesn't automatically mean you're anything, but it *can* be a sign you're attracted to the same sex, or simply appreciate seeing diverse representation of love.
* **Imagining dating a girl and liking the idea:** This is a significant point. Fantasizing about romantic or sexual scenarios with someone of the same sex is a strong indicator of attraction.  It's your brain exploring possibilities.
* **Finding guys cute:**  Also a normal and important part of the picture!  Attraction to men doesn't negate any potential attraction to women.

**So, could this be bisexuality?  Yes, absolutely. It very well could be.**

**What *is* Bisexuality?**

Bisexuality is attraction to both men and women. However, it's often understood more broadly as attraction to *more than one gender*. This can include non-binary people, genderfluid people, and other gender identities.

**Important nuances about bisexuality:**

* **It doesn't have to be 50/50:**  You don't need to be attracted to men and women equally. The *degree* of attraction can fluctuate over time, or be different for each gender. Some days you might feel more drawn to one than the other, and that's okay.
* **It's not a phase:**  This is a harmful and untrue stereotype.
* **Bisexual erasure is real:** Bisexual people often face the misconception that they are ""confused,"" ""greedy,"" or ""just going through a phase.""  Ignore these invalidating ideas.
* **Bisexuality is distinct from pansexuality:** While there's overlap, pansexuality is generally defined as attraction *regardless* of gender.  Some people feel pansexuality better describes their experience. (See more below.)



**However, it's also possible other identities might fit:**

* **Pansexuality:**  As mentioned, pansexual people are attracted to people regardless of gender.  If gender truly isn't a factor in your attraction, you might identify with this more.  The difference between bi and pan can be subtle and personal.
* **Queer:** This is an umbrella term that some people use to describe a sexuality that isn't exclusively heterosexual. It can be a good option if you're not sure about a more specific label.
* **Fluid:**  Some people's sexuality changes over time.  If you feel your attraction shifts, ""fluid"" might resonate.
* **Homoflexible:** Primarily attracted to the same sex, but occasionally attracted to the opposite sex.
* **Heteroflexible:** Primarily attracted to the opposite sex, but occasionally attracted to the same sex.
* **Questioning:**  It's *completely okay* to not know!  ""Questioning"" is a valid identity in itself. It means you're still exploring.



**What should you do now?**

1. **Don't feel pressured to label yourself.** You don't *need* a label if you don't want one. It's about what feels right for *you*.
2. **Explore your feelings:** Continue to pay attention to what attracts you. What do you like about men? What do you like about women? What kind of relationships do you envision yourself in?
3. **Do some research:**  Learn more about different sexual orientations and gender identities.  Here are some resources:

"I've tried working out and eating fruits and vegetables, but I always seem to eat the junk in the house.","I know some people do better when they don't have as much junk food in the house. This is not as tempting then. Having said that, maybe you can reward yourself with different things, such as having dessert on certain days. If you are concerned about mostly eating habits, consider seeing a nutritionist. They can help you find the balance between what it is that you really want and your goals. I'm not sure how this links to happiness for you, but hopefully looking at your choices can lead you toward your goal of being healthier.","Okay, that's *super* common! You're definitely not alone in this. It's great that you're *trying* to work out and eat healthy, that's the biggest step.  It sounds like the environment is working against you. Let's break down why this happens and then look at a bunch of strategies. We'll cover psychology, practical changes, and habit building.  I'll give a lot of ideas - pick and choose what feels doable for *you* right now.  Don't try to overhaul everything at once!

**Why This Happens: Understanding the Struggle**

* **Convenience:** Junk food is designed to be hyper-palatable (delicious, easy to eat) and readily available. It requires zero effort.  An apple needs washing, maybe cutting. Chips are *right there*.
* **Emotional Eating:** Often, we reach for junk food when we're stressed, bored, sad, or even just tired. It's a comfort mechanism.
* **Habit & Reward System:** Our brains *love* habits. Junk food releases dopamine, a feel-good chemical, creating a reward loop.  You feel good, your brain remembers, and it wants more.
* **Restriction Backfire:**  If you *completely* restrict yourself, you're more likely to binge.  The more you tell yourself you *can't* have something, the more you want it.
* **Visibility:** If it's in sight, you're more likely to eat it. This is huge.
* **Household Dynamics:** If others in your household are constantly bringing in or eating junk food, it's harder to resist.
* **Lack of Planning:**  Not having healthy snacks prepared means you default to the easiest option (junk).



**Okay, let's get to strategies. I'm going to organize these into sections:**

**I. Environment Control (Making it Harder to Fail)**

This is the *most important* part, especially if willpower feels low.

* **Out of Sight, Out of Mind:** This is #1.  Seriously.
    * **Remove it:**  The most effective solution is to simply *not buy* the junk food. If it's not in the house, you can't eat it.  Start small – pick one or two things to stop buying each week.
    * **Hide it:** If you can't completely remove it (because of other family members), put it in hard-to-reach places. Top shelves, back of the pantry, opaque containers. Make it *inconvenient*.
    * **Rearrange:**  Put healthy foods at eye level in the fridge and on counters.  Make them the first thing you see.
* **Visual Cues:**
    * **Fruit Bowl:** Keep a beautiful, appealing fruit bowl on the counter.  Make it inviting!
    * **Pre-Cut Veggies:**  Cut up carrots, celery, peppers, cucumbers and store them in clear containers in the fridge.  Easy snacking.
* **Change Your Shopping Habits:**
    * **Shop After Eating:** Never grocery shop hungry!
    * **Make a List & Stick To It:** Plan your meals and snacks for the week and *only* buy what's on the list.
    * **Online Grocery Shopping:** This can help you avoid impulse purchases.
    * **Don't Browse the Junk Food Aisles:**  Seriously, just walk past them.

**II.  Mindful Eating & Emotional Regulation (Addressing the 'Why' You're Eating)**

* **Identify Your Triggers:** What situations, emotions, or times of day make you crave junk food?  Keep a food diary *without judgement*. Just write down what you ate, when, and how you were feeling.
* **Find Alternatives for Emotional Needs:**  If you're eating because you're stressed, try:
    * **Exercise:** (You're already doing this, awesome!)
    * **Meditation/Deep Breathing:** Even 5 minutes can help.
    * **Calling a Friend:** Social connection.
    * **Reading:** Distraction.
    * **Hobbies:**  Something you enjoy.
* **Practice Mindful Eating:**
    * **Slow Down:**  Put your fork down between bites.
    * **Pay Attention:**  Notice the taste, texture, and smell of your food.
    * **Eat Without Distractions:** Turn off the TV, put away your phone.
    * **Ask Yourself:** ""Am I actually hungry?""  Often, we're not.
* **Allow for Indulgence (Strategically):**  Completely forbidding yourself can backfire.  
    * **Planned Treats:**  Schedule a small indulgence once or twice a week.  This makes it feel less forbidden."
I feel really uncomfortable when I have people's attention.  It makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class. Can I get over this social anxiety?,"you can learn lots of skills/techniques to feel more confident in what you need to do that will decrease your anxious response for sure! :) And  you can also learn how to work with your personality that may not like the attention. You may find that ""talking"" to others through the internet is more comfortable and you are great at it, or that you love one on one talking but aren't really made for group talking. There is a place in this world for you either way! Public speaking skills can be practiced in speech class, or toastmaster group, they will give you practice in a safe environment where the cool kids or cutest boy aren't ready to laugh at you.  What topics are you interested in and what groups can you do a little speaking up? Maybe in your small group at church try and raise you hand to share your opinion, or maybe your Girl Scout troop? Look around for a peer and one adult who you like to hear speak out, ask them to share with you 2 things that help them feel comfortable speaking in public. Check out some Ted Talks and see how they share in groups. Social anxiety is a difficult concern and picking apart what is your awesome personality and what needs skill building and mindfulness/anxiety  help are important steps. Good luck!","Okay, it's *completely* understandable that you feel uncomfortable when you're the center of attention. It's a really common experience, and you're definitely not alone in this. The fact that you recognize it and want to work on it is a fantastic first step! It sounds like you're describing a form of social anxiety, and yes, absolutely, it *can* be gotten over, or at least managed to the point where it doesn't control your life. It takes work, but it's very possible.

Here's a breakdown of things to consider, strategies to try, and resources to look into.  I'll organize it into sections: Understanding, Coping Strategies, Building Confidence, and When to Seek Professional Help.  This is a long response, but I want to be thorough!

**1. Understanding What's Going On**

* **It's Not Just You:**  As mentioned, this is incredibly common.  Social anxiety isn't just shyness. It's a genuine anxiety response triggered by social situations, particularly those where you fear being judged, embarrassed, humiliated, or scrutinized.
* **The Physical Symptoms:**  Your discomfort likely has physical manifestations.  These can include:
    * **Racing heart**
    * **Sweating**
    * **Trembling**
    * **Blushing**
    * **Muscle tension**
    * **Nausea/stomach upset**
    * **Mind going blank**
* **The Thought Patterns:**  Often, what's happening *internally* is the key.  Common thought patterns include:
    * **Negative self-talk:** ""I'm going to sound stupid."" ""They're all judging me."" ""I'll mess up.""
    * **Catastrophizing:**  Imagining the worst possible outcome. (""If I stumble over my words, everyone will laugh and I'll be mortified."")
    * **Mind-reading:**  Assuming you know what others are thinking (and that it's negative). (""They think I'm boring."")
    * **Focus on flaws:**  Dwelling on perceived imperfections.
* **Why it happens:** Often rooted in past experiences (maybe a negative experience speaking up as a child) or learned behaviors. It can also be related to temperament – some people are just naturally more sensitive to social cues.



**2. Coping Strategies (For the Moment)**

These are things you can use *in the moment* when you're feeling anxious. They won't magically cure the anxiety, but they can help you get through it.

* **Deep Breathing:**  This is your go-to.  Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system.  Try the 4-7-8 technique: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds. Repeat several times.
* **Grounding Techniques:** These help bring you back to the present moment.
    * **5-4-3-2-1:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Focus on your feet:**  Feel your feet on the ground.  Really notice the sensation.
* **Positive Self-Talk (Countering Negative Thoughts):**  Challenge those negative thoughts. Instead of ""I'm going to sound stupid,"" try ""I've prepared for this, and I'll do my best. It's okay if I'm not perfect.""
* **Acceptance:** Sometimes, fighting the anxiety makes it worse. Acknowledge that you're feeling anxious, and that's okay. ""I'm feeling anxious right now, and that's a normal response. It will pass.""
* **Visualize Success:**  Before a situation, imagine yourself handling it well.  Visualize yourself speaking clearly and confidently.
* **Slow Down:**  When speaking, consciously slow down your pace.  This can help you feel more in control.
* **Have an ""Exit Strategy"":**  Knowing you can politely excuse yourself if you need to can reduce anxiety.



**3. Building Confidence (Long-Term)**

These strategies require more consistent effort, but they're crucial for lasting change.

* **Gradual Exposure:**  This is the *most effective* technique for overcoming social anxiety. Start small.  Don't jump into giving a presentation right away.  Instead:
    * **Start with low-pressure situations:**  Say hello to a cashier.  Ask a simple question in a small group.  Make eye contact with people.
    * **Gradually increase the challenge:**  Offer a comment in class.  Answer a question when you're confident in the answer.  Participate in"
"I've been bulimic for about 6 years now. I'm in my early 20s. I am about to start back to school to become an RN, and I really need to get better once and for all.    I lose control of myself and become angry and anxious and just eat and purge. Over and over. Can someone please point me in the right direction for help?","Eating disorders usually result from a sense of insecurity about who the person is, whether they are good enough compared with anyone else, and whether the way they person lives is effective.If you have a style you're already happy with to reflect on these sorts of topics, keep following your own logic with the aim to free yourself, which usually takes place gradually, from these sort of self-doubts.The other approach would be to find an unperson or an online discussion group where you'd be able to offer and receive the support from other people who live with a similar problem.Good luck in your studies!","Okay, this is incredibly brave of you to acknowledge this and to *want* to get better, especially with the added stress of starting nursing school. That takes a lot of strength.  It's fantastic that you're recognizing this needs to be addressed *before* starting this demanding program.  Nursing school is hard enough without the added burden of an eating disorder.  Here's a breakdown of how to get help, covering different levels of care and resources, geared specifically towards your situation.  I'll also address the anger and anxiety piece.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am not a medical professional.**

**1. Immediate Support & Crisis Lines (Right Now):**

*   **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text 988.  This is available 24/7 and can provide immediate support if you're feeling overwhelmed, suicidal, or in a dangerous place with your bulimia.  They can also connect you to local resources.  Even if you're not suicidal, they can help de-escalate a crisis moment. [https://988lifeline.org/](https://988lifeline.org/)
*   **The Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741.  Another 24/7 option for immediate support via text.
*   **National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) Helpline:** 1-800-931-2237.  This helpline is staffed by trained volunteers who can provide support, resources, and referrals. They have hours listed on their website. [https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/)

**2. Levels of Treatment – Finding What’s Right for You:**

Bulimia requires a multi-faceted approach. Here's a breakdown of options.  Given your 6-year struggle and the intensity you describe, a higher level of care is likely needed initially.

*   **Outpatient Therapy:**  This is a good starting point for some, but may not be sufficient *alone* given the length of your struggle and the presence of intense emotions.  Look for a therapist specializing in eating disorders.  **Specifically, look for someone trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), or Family-Based Therapy (FBT – even if you don’t involve family directly, the principles can be helpful).** CBT helps change thought patterns and behaviors, and DBT is excellent for managing intense emotions (the anger and anxiety you mention).
*   **Nutritional Counseling:** *Essential*.  You need to work with a Registered Dietitian (RD) who specializes in eating disorders. They can help you normalize eating patterns, challenge food rules, and understand your body's needs.  They will work *with* your therapy.
*   **Medical Monitoring:**  Bulimia can cause serious health problems (electrolyte imbalances, heart issues, dental problems, etc.).  You *need* a medical doctor to monitor your physical health.  This is often done in conjunction with therapy and nutritional counseling.  Your primary care physician can be a starting point, but they may refer you to a specialist.
*   **Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP):**  This is a step up from regular outpatient therapy.  It typically involves several hours of therapy and nutritional counseling per week.  It allows for more intensive support while still allowing you to live at home.  This might be a good fit to build a strong foundation before starting school.
*   **Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP):**  Even more intensive than IOP.  You attend a program during the day, but return home at night.
*   **Residential Treatment:**  This involves living at a treatment facility for a period of time (typically weeks to months).  It's the most intensive level of care and is often recommended for severe cases, or when other levels of care haven’t been successful.  Given the length of your struggle, this might be something to seriously consider.



**3.  Addressing the Anger & Anxiety:**

You specifically mentioned anger and anxiety as triggers for your bulimic behaviors. This is *crucial* to address directly:

*   **DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy):**  I mentioned this above, but it's worth emphasizing.  DBT is *specifically* designed to help people regulate intense emotions like anger and anxiety. It teaches skills in mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotional regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.  Finding a DBT therapist is highly recommended.
*   **"
I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?,It is absolutely a typical response.  Many of my clients are nervous the first couple of times we meet.  This is essentially a stranger with whom you are sharing your feelings.,"Okay, it's *completely* normal to feel nervous and shaky going to therapy, even after a few sessions! You're definitely not alone in this, and it's good you're asking about it. Here's a breakdown of why it happens, whether it's something to expect to lessen, and what you can do about it.

**Why You're Likely Feeling This Way:**

* **Vulnerability:** Therapy requires you to be vulnerable – to talk about things that are often difficult, painful, or embarrassing.  That's inherently nerve-wracking for most people. You're letting someone *in*.
* **Uncertainty:** Even after a couple of sessions, you might still be unsure of the process, unsure of your therapist's reactions, and unsure of what will come up.  The unknown is anxiety-provoking.
* **Re-experiencing Past Trauma (even small 't' trauma):**  If you're dealing with past trauma, even just the *setting* of a therapy room can trigger anxiety responses.  It can feel like you're revisiting uncomfortable feelings.
* **Fear of Judgment:**  Even if you intellectually know your therapist is non-judgmental, a part of you might still fear being judged or misunderstood.
* **Habit/Anticipatory Anxiety:**  Your body might be learning to associate *going to* therapy with feeling anxious.  This is called anticipatory anxiety – you start feeling anxious *before* the trigger even happens.
* **It's a New Relationship:**  Building trust with a therapist takes time.  It's a professional relationship, but it's still a relationship, and those take time to feel comfortable in.
* **You're Doing Important Work:** Feeling uncomfortable can be a sign you are challenging yourself and doing the hard work of self-exploration.



**Should You Still Be Feeling Like This?**

After a couple of sessions, you *might* expect to feel *slightly* more comfortable, but it’s absolutely okay if you’re still feeling nervous. There isn't a timeline for feeling ""better"" with therapy. Some people adjust quickly, others take much longer.  The fact that you're feeling *shaky* is a stronger reaction, and it's good that you're noticing it.  It's worth exploring *why* it's so strong.

**Here's what to consider in terms of ""should"":**

* **Mild Nervousness is Okay:** A little bit of pre-session anxiety is often normal and fades relatively quickly once you start talking.
* **Intense Physical Symptoms (like shaking) are Worth Addressing:** The shakiness suggests a high level of anxiety. It's something you should discuss with your therapist.
* **If it's Preventing You From Engaging:** If the anxiety is so strong that you're unable to fully participate in the session, or you're dreading it to the point of wanting to avoid it altogether, that's a sign you need to address it.




**What You Can Do About It:**

1. **Talk to Your Therapist! (This is the *most* important step)**  Seriously.  Tell them exactly what you're experiencing.  Say something like: ""I've noticed that I still get really nervous and shaky before and when I first walk into the session. It makes it hard to focus. I was wondering if we could talk about that.""

   * **What your therapist might do:**
      * **Normalize it:** They'll likely reassure you that it's common.
      * **Explore the reasons:** They'll help you identify *what* specifically is making you anxious.
      * **Teach you coping skills:** They can offer techniques to manage your anxiety (see #3 below).
      * **Adjust the pace:**  They might adjust the pace of therapy to make it feel less overwhelming.
      * **Check in on the therapeutic relationship:** They’ll make sure you feel safe and comfortable with them.

2. **Before the Session:**
   * **Journal:** Write down your feelings and anxieties before the session.  Getting them out on paper can help lessen their intensity.
   * **Grounding Techniques:** Practice grounding exercises (see #3) before you leave for your appointment.
   * **Self-Compassion:** Remind yourself that you are doing something brave and that it’s okay to feel uncomfortable.
   * **Plan a Reward:**  Have something small and enjoyable planned for *after* the session, to give yourself something to look forward to.

3. **Coping Skills (to use before, during, and after):**
   * **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system. (Box breathing: inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for"
"I can't even smile or fake one. I can't feel happiness about anything and I can't show love towards another person not even my girlfriend. I hate myself sometimes. All I see is ugly.
   I can't get over the loss of a loved one and I'm not close to my family. What can I do?","Trust and believe your own feelings.Emotions are real and reflect how someone feels about a situation.Since you're sad about losing a loved one, be patient w your feelings about this.  Basically, be guided by how you feel and eventually you will feel different emotions which I hope will be happier ones.","Okay, this sounds incredibly painful and difficult. It takes a lot of courage to even *say* these things, so I want to acknowledge that first. You're clearly hurting deeply, and it's completely understandable that you're struggling. It's also really important that you *did* reach out, even just by writing this. That's a first step, and it means a part of you wants things to be different.

Let's break down what you've said and talk about some potential steps.  I'm going to give a lot of information, so please don't feel like you need to do everything at once.  Even picking one small thing to focus on can be a good start.  **Important Disclaimer at the end, too, please read it.**

**What you're describing sounds a lot like depression, potentially complicated grief, and low self-esteem.**  These things often overlap and feed into each other.  Here's how we can address each part:

**1. Grief & Loss:**

* **It's okay to not be ""over"" it.** There's no timeline for grief.  It sounds like this loss is still very raw.  It's not about forgetting, it's about *learning to live with* the loss.
* **Unprocessed Grief:**  Because you aren't close to your family, it's possible you haven't had adequate support or a healthy outlet to process your grief.  This can make it linger and intensify.
* **Grief Counseling:**  This is *specifically* designed to help you navigate loss. A therapist specializing in grief can provide tools and a safe space to explore your feelings.  (More on finding help later).
* **Grief Rituals:** Even small ones can help. This could be lighting a candle, looking at photos, writing a letter to the person you lost, visiting a place that reminds you of them, or doing something they enjoyed.
* **Allow Yourself to Feel:**  Don't suppress the sadness, anger, or whatever emotions come up.  Trying to bottle them up will only make them stronger in the long run.  Find *healthy* ways to express them (journaling, art, music, etc.).

**2. Depression & Lack of Happiness/Love:**

* **Anhedonia:** The inability to feel pleasure (what you're describing with not being able to feel happiness) is a core symptom of depression.  It's not a character flaw; it's a biological and psychological state.
* **Depression & Emotional Numbness:** Depression can manifest as emotional numbness, making it hard to feel *anything*, including love.
* **Self-Hatred:** This is very common with depression. It's a distortion of your self-perception. The ""ugly"" you see is likely colored by the depression, not reality.
* **Professional Help is Crucial:**  Depression is often best treated with a combination of therapy and/or medication.  A psychiatrist can evaluate if medication is right for you.  A therapist can help you identify and change negative thought patterns and develop coping mechanisms.
* **Small Steps to Re-Engage:** Even when you don't *feel* like it, try small things that used to bring you joy.  Listen to music, go for a walk in nature, read a book, watch a funny movie.  Don't expect a huge emotional response, but just see if it shifts anything slightly.
* **Challenge Negative Thoughts:** When you think ""I'm ugly,"" ask yourself: ""Is this really true?  What evidence do I have to support this? What evidence contradicts it?""  Depression often lies to us.

**3. Relationship with Girlfriend:**

* **Be Honest (with compassion):** This is really hard, but your girlfriend deserves honesty.  Tell her you're struggling with your mental health and that it's impacting your ability to connect emotionally.  *Don't blame her.*  Frame it as *your* internal struggle. Something like: ""I'm really struggling right now with depression, and it's making it hard for me to feel and express affection. It's not you, it's me, and I'm working on getting help.""
* **Small Gestures:** Even if you don't *feel* loving, you can still *act* lovingly.  Small acts of kindness, like making her coffee, doing a chore for her, or just listening attentively, can show you care.
* **Couples Therapy:**  If she's willing, couples therapy can help you both navigate this.
* **Recognize the Strain:**  Be aware that your inability to show affection is likely causing her pain.  It's important to address this, or the relationship may not survive.

**4. Family Distance:**"
"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","From your initial description, I would say that your mother is ""Maloriented"". In this stage of Alzheimer's individuals tend to be blaming and difficult to deal with. They may often hide or throw things away and then blame family members for this. In addition, if they are incontinent, they may blame a leaky roof or something else when they are wet. You are correct that this is not her fault, but often for family members this does not make it any easier for you to cope. I strongly suggest that you learn communication strategies that will help you to communicate with your mother in a way that lets her work through the difficulties associated with the disease. I always suggest Validation techniques to family members.In addition, you need to give yourself some kind attention and take time out from your circumstances as needed. You need to be able to center yourself and come to acceptance that this is your mother's illness that is the problem, not her and certainly not you.","Okay, this is *incredibly* common, and you are absolutely right to recognize the conflict you're feeling. It's a truly difficult situation, and it's completely understandable to be frustrated and angry, *and* to feel guilty about those feelings.  You're navigating a huge emotional challenge. Here's a breakdown of how to cope, combining practical strategies and ways to manage your emotions, broken down into sections.  I'll also include resources at the end.

**1. Understanding the ""Why"" (and Re-framing)**

* **It *is* the disease:** This is the most important thing to keep repeating to yourself. Alzheimer's doesn't just affect memory. It affects personality, judgment, impulse control, and the ability to regulate emotions. The ""nasty"" and ""mean"" behavior isn't *your mother* intentionally trying to hurt you. It's the disease altering her brain chemistry and function. The unrealistic requests are a result of disorientation and a loss of the ability to reason.
* **Loss of Control:** Think about how terrifying it must be for her to feel her mind slipping away.  She's likely lashing out because she *feels* vulnerable, confused, and scared, even if she can't articulate that.  The behavior is often a manifestation of her own distress.
* **Brain Changes:**  Specific areas of the brain impacted by Alzheimer's are responsible for things like empathy and social appropriateness.  She's not necessarily *aware* that what she's saying is hurtful.
* **Re-framing:**  Instead of thinking ""She's being mean to me,"" try thinking ""The Alzheimer's is causing her to express herself in this way.""  Or, ""She's feeling scared and confused, and this is how it's coming out."" This isn't excusing the behavior, but it's shifting the focus to the source of the problem.



**2.  Strategies for Handling Difficult Interactions**

* **Validation, Not Logic:** Arguing or trying to reason with her will almost always escalate things. Her brain can't process logic in the same way anymore. Instead, *validate her feelings,* even if her request is nonsensical.
    * **Example:**  She asks for her mother (who has been deceased for decades).  Instead of saying ""Mom died years ago,"" try:  ""You miss your mother. She was a wonderful woman.""  Or, ""You're thinking about happy times with your mother.""
    * **Example:** She demands you find her ""the blue elephants."" Instead of explaining there are no blue elephants, try: ""Oh, you'd like to see something beautiful and colorful. Let's look at some pictures of flowers.""
* **Distraction:**  Changing the subject can often defuse a situation. Have a few go-to topics that she enjoys (even if it's something small, like a favorite song, a pet, or a pleasant memory from the past – simplified).
* **Keep Interactions Simple:** Use short sentences, speak slowly and clearly, and avoid complex questions.
* **Avoid Triggers:**  If you notice certain topics or situations consistently lead to negative behavior, try to avoid them.
* **The ""Therapeutic Fib"":**  Sometimes, a gentle, harmless lie can avoid distress.  If she's looking for someone who isn't there, you can say, ""They just stepped out for a moment.""
* **Limit Choices:** Too many options can be overwhelming.  Instead of ""What do you want to wear?"" try ""Would you like the red shirt or the blue shirt?""
* **Physical Comfort:** A gentle touch, holding her hand, or a hug (if she allows it) can sometimes be soothing.



**3.  Managing *Your* Emotions**

* **Acknowledge Your Feelings:**  It's okay to feel frustrated, angry, sad, resentful, and exhausted.  Don't beat yourself up for having these feelings. They are a normal response to a very stressful situation.
* **Take Breaks:** This is *critical*.  You cannot pour from an empty cup.  Schedule regular breaks for yourself, even if it's just 15-20 minutes a day.  
    * **Respite Care:** Explore respite care options. This could be a few hours a week of in-home care, adult day care, or even a short-term stay at a care facility.  This gives you dedicated time to recharge.
* **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a healthy way to process them.
* **Mindfulness & Relaxation Techniques:**  Deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga can help you manage stress and anxiety.
* **Exercise:** Physical activity is a great stress reliever.
* **Talk to Someone:**  This is"
"I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it.
 I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call.
 I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive. I know what I'm doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change. How do I stop this behavior and thought process?","Good for you on your keen awareness of your difficulties and your willingness to change!The type of change you'd like to achieve is possible, and since a change in self-confidence and self-love is deep rooted, this comes about gradually and slowly.Keep understanding yourself during your moments of doubt and anxiety.  Its fine to feel terrible and certainly better to know you feel insecure than to act upon the insecurity by being with men who take advantage of you.Everyone needs to feel loved and recognized.Until you attract a partner who will love and appreciate you, develop relationships with co-workers and classmates, neighbors, so that you have some quality of giving and being given by someone.It is a way to nurture yourself and another person until your strength and self-belief grow bigger.","Okay, this is a *really* important and brave step to recognize this pattern and want to change. It sounds incredibly painful, and you're right to identify that you're repeating a cycle that's hurting you. You've already done the hardest part: **awareness.** Now comes the work, and it *is* work, but it's work that will lead to a much healthier and happier you. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, broken down into sections, and I'll be thorough.  This is a complex issue, so this will be a lengthy response.  Please read it all, and consider seeking professional help (more on that at the end).

**1. Understanding the Roots: Why This Happens**

Before tackling the behavior, let's look at *why* it's happening.  This isn't about blaming you; it's about understanding the drivers.  Here are some likely factors:

* **Early Attachment:** Your discomfort with being alone, and the feeling of needing someone to ""survive,"" strongly suggests potential issues with early attachment.  How you related to your primary caregivers (usually parents) in childhood profoundly shapes how you form relationships as an adult. If your needs weren’t consistently met, or if there was inconsistency in care, you might have developed an anxious attachment style. This leads to a fear of abandonment and a tendency to cling to others.
* **Low Self-Worth:** Letting others control you, accepting abuse, and constantly seeking approval all point to underlying low self-worth. You may not believe you *deserve* better, or you may feel you have nothing to offer that would warrant someone wanting to be with you unconditionally.
* **Familiarity:**  Unfortunately, even painful patterns can feel…familiar.  Your brain can become wired to seek out what it *knows*, even if what it knows is harmful.  This is especially true if the dynamics of these relationships echo patterns from your childhood.
* **Fear of Abandonment:** This is huge. The fear of being alone is so powerful that you're willing to tolerate mistreatment to avoid it.
* **The ""Fixer"" Role:**  You might unconsciously try to ""fix"" these unavailable men, believing that *if* you just love them enough, *if* you're perfect enough, they will finally choose you and give you the relationship you crave.  This is exhausting and, of course, doesn’t work.
* **Gaslighting & Control Tactics:** The accusation of *you* being controlling when you're the one being controlled is a classic gaslighting tactic.  Abusers often project their own behavior onto their victims to maintain power.  You've likely been conditioned to doubt your own perceptions.



**2. Breaking the Cycle: Practical Steps**

This is the hardest part, but also the most rewarding.

* **No Contact (Crucial):**  This means *absolutely no contact* with any men who exhibit the patterns you've described – unavailable, seeking only intimacy, controlling, or abusive.  This includes texting, calling, social media stalking, ""checking in,"" etc.  It's incredibly difficult, but essential.  Think of it as detoxing.  You need space to heal and re-learn how to be you.
* **Therapy (Highly Recommended – See Section 4):**  A therapist, especially one specializing in attachment theory, trauma, or codependency, can provide the tools and support you need to unpack these patterns and develop healthier coping mechanisms.
* **Build Your Self-Worth:**  This is ongoing work.
    * **Identify Your Strengths:** What are you good at? What do you enjoy? Make a list.  It might feel hard at first, but keep brainstorming.
    * **Positive Self-Talk:**  Challenge negative thoughts. When you catch yourself thinking something critical about yourself, reframe it.  Instead of ""I'm unlovable,"" try ""I am worthy of love, and I deserve someone who treats me with respect.""  (It will feel silly at first, but consistency is key.)
    * **Self-Compassion:** Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend.
    * **Set Boundaries (and Enforce Them):**  This is huge.  Start small.  ""I need some time to myself tonight."" ""I'm not comfortable discussing that.""  ""No, I can't do that for you.""  People may push back, but stand your ground.  This is where the accusations of *you* being controlling might resurface – recognize it as a tactic.
* **Reclaim Your Time:**  You mentioned not being comfortable being alone.  This is your biggest challenge.  Start small:
    * **Schedule Solo Activities:**  Even if it’s just reading a book in a coffee shop,"
"I was with my friends fishing by a pond. I found a frog and stabbed it with my friend's knife. I'm not sure why I did it. My friends saw me do it it and were shocked and got really mad at me.

Now if someone brings it up I get really upset and panicked. I don't know why I feel like this. Does this mean there is something wrong with me?","The good news is your awareness that being violent to animals feels out of character for you.   I'm glad you have awareness and I'm glad you are not at ease with killing frogs.Fairly likely that you were acting out aggressively toward the frog, feelings of being on the receiving side of similar type of violence.Basically, you did unto the frog what someone has or to you, feels like, has been done to you.Use your surprising finding of how strong your anger and most likely inward pain.   Reflect on your closest relationships and how these people treat you.   It is possible you feel more hurt by someone who is close to you than you ever realized.Stabbing innocent frogs is wrong.  It is understandable as a way to show you how much inner pain you probably have.It is also wrong that someone close to you hurt you.The direction to go is to recognize your pain and then decide how to go about changing what is possible on your side of that or those relationship(s).","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's good you're reaching out and trying to understand why you're feeling this way. What you did was harmful to the frog, and it understandably upset your friends. Your reaction *now* – the upset and panic when it's brought up – is also something important to address. Let's break this down.

**First, about the act itself:**

* **It was harmful and likely cruel.**  Frogs are living creatures that can feel pain, even if it's different from how humans experience it.  Stabbing it was a violent act.
* **The ""why"" is important.** You said you don't know *why* you did it. That's a key part of understanding what's going on.  Impulsive acts of cruelty, especially when out of character, can stem from a lot of different places.  We'll get to those.
* **Your friends' reaction was valid.** They were shocked and angered because what you did was wrong.  Their reaction is a natural and appropriate response.

**Now, let's focus on *your* feelings *afterward* – the upset and panic.** This is the core of what you're asking about, and it's really important. Here are several possible reasons why you might be reacting this way.  It's likely a combination of factors:

* **Guilt and Remorse:** This is the most obvious. You likely recognize, on some level, that what you did was wrong, and that's causing you emotional distress. This is a *good* thing, in a way, because it shows you have empathy.
* **Shame:**  Shame is different from guilt.  Guilt is about *what you did*; shame is about *who you are*.  You might be feeling shame because you see this act as inconsistent with the person you *want* to be.  You might be thinking, ""I'm a bad person for doing that.""
* **Fear of Judgment:**  You're likely afraid of how your friends (and potentially others) perceive you now.  You're worried about being judged, rejected, or ostracized.
* **Anxiety about Your Own Impulsivity:**  The fact that you don't know *why* you did it can be terrifying.  It suggests a lack of control, and that can be very anxiety-provoking.  You might be afraid you're capable of doing something like this again.
* **Underlying Emotional Distress:** Sometimes, acts of cruelty towards animals can be a manifestation of *your own* internal pain, anger, or frustration.  The frog became an unfortunate outlet for feelings you weren't consciously aware of or equipped to handle.  This doesn’t excuse the act, but it can explain the impulse.
* **Possible Trauma Response:**  Less commonly, but importantly to consider, sometimes such acts can be related to past trauma.



**Does this mean something is ""wrong"" with you?**

Not necessarily.  But it *does* mean something is going on that needs attention. Everyone is capable of making mistakes, and experiencing difficult emotions.  However, the level of distress you're experiencing, and the fact that you're questioning yourself, suggests you would benefit from talking to someone.

**What should you do?**

1. **Talk to a Trusted Adult:**  This could be a parent, teacher, counselor, or another adult you trust.  It's important to share what happened and how you're feeling with someone who can offer support and guidance.  This is *especially* important because of the nature of the act.
2. **Consider Professional Help:**  I strongly recommend talking to a therapist or counselor.  They can help you:
    * **Explore the ""why"":**  Uncover the underlying reasons for your behavior.
    * **Process your emotions:**  Deal with the guilt, shame, anxiety, and any other feelings you're experiencing.
    * **Develop coping mechanisms:** Learn healthier ways to manage difficult emotions and impulses.
    * **Assess for any underlying issues:** Determine if there are any deeper psychological factors at play.
3. **Apologize to Your Friends:** A sincere apology to your friends is important.  Acknowledge the harm you caused and express your remorse.  Be prepared for them to still be upset, and respect their feelings.  Don’t expect immediate forgiveness.
4. **Practice Self-Compassion:**  Be kind to yourself.  You made a mistake.  Dwelling on it endlessly won't help.  Focus on learning from it and making better choices in the future.
5. **Animal Welfare:** Consider doing something positive for animals. Volunteering at an animal shelter or donating to an animal welfare organization could be a way to channel your remorse"
"I’m a man, and I’m soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but it’s been happening a lot. I don't know what to do.","Hello, and thank you for your question. When faced with these kinds of difficult challenges, I usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be. Indeed, it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we don't feel very content with our lives. Perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions: What kind of person do I want to be deep in my heart? What kind of character do I want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching? How would I want others to describe me? Let's say that you want others to see you as being authentic, and YOU also value authenticity as something you want to live by. You may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now. That you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart. This is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation. So please, try not to feel alone. We all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc. And I am not just talking about being unaccepted by others, but a person may have a VERY hard time accepting themselves. Thinking about your values and living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom, but I won't lie, it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time. For example, someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for, even if that means people may disapprove. That may cause a lot of pain, but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity. It may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy, which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them. I would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are... both as an individual and as someone's fiancé.Above all, I wish you well in this journey. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's good you're acknowledging it and reaching out, even if it's to an anonymous source like this. It takes courage to face something like this. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering the gravity of the situation, your options, and resources to help.  This will be a long response, because it *needs* to be thorough.  I'm going to divide it into sections: **Understanding the Severity, Immediate Steps, Exploring Your Feelings, Options & Considerations, and Resources.**

**1. Understanding the Severity**

Let's be very clear: what you've described is infidelity.  It's a breach of trust, and it has the potential to cause immense pain to your future spouse. Even though you haven't *yet* said your vows, you are engaged and building a life with someone based on the expectation of fidelity.  Continuing this behavior will almost certainly be deeply damaging if it comes to light.  The fact that it's escalating is a significant concern.  It suggests there are underlying issues needing attention.  Ignoring it won’t make it go away; it will likely worsen the situation and create a larger betrayal when you do marry.  

**2. Immediate Steps: Stop the Behavior – *Now***

This is the most crucial step.  Regardless of what you decide to do about disclosing this, *you must stop all contact with the people you've been involved with.*  This means:

*   **No more encounters:**  Absolutely no further physical or emotional intimacy.
*   **Cut off communication:**  Delete numbers, block on social media, avoid places you know they frequent.  Any continued contact is fueling the problem and making a potential resolution even harder.
*   **Self-protection:**  Be aware of potential digital footprints (messages, apps, etc.).  While not about covering things up (that's different), it's about creating space for you to think and not be tempted.  This doesn't mean destroying evidence, but being mindful of what's accessible.
*   **Recognize this is about *you* making a choice:** You are responsible for your actions, and stopping is a demonstration of your willingness to take responsibility.



**3. Exploring Your Feelings: Why is this happening?**

Before you make any decisions about telling your fiancée or not, you need to understand *why* you've been engaging in this behavior. This isn’t about excuses, but about identifying the root causes.  Some possible reasons (and these are just examples – a therapist can help you explore this more deeply):

*   **Unmet Needs:** Are there emotional, physical, or intimacy needs that aren’t being met in your current relationship?  (This doesn't excuse the infidelity, but it explains it).
*   **Fear of Commitment:** Are you subconsciously sabotaging the relationship because you're afraid of the commitment of marriage?
*   **Sexual Exploration/Curiosity:**  Is this driven by curiosity or a desire to explore your sexuality?  This is valid, but needs to be addressed *openly and honestly*.
*   **Past Trauma:**  Sometimes, infidelity is linked to unresolved trauma or patterns from the past.
*   **Relationship Issues:** Are there underlying problems in your relationship with your fiancée that you haven’t addressed?
* **Identity:** Are you grappling with your sexual orientation? (This is a significant possibility, given you're attracted to men).

Journaling can be a helpful way to start this exploration.  Write down your thoughts and feelings without judgment.  



**4. Options & Considerations: What do you do next?**

You essentially have two main paths, both of which are difficult:

*   **Option 1: Disclosure (Telling Your Fiancée)**

    *   **Pros:**  Honesty, potentially preserving the relationship (if she chooses to work through it), living with integrity.  It allows her to make an informed decision about her future.
    *   **Cons:**  Extreme pain and potential end of the relationship, loss of trust, difficult conversations.  There's a very real chance she will leave.
    *   **How to disclose (if you choose this):**
        *   **Timing:** Choose a private, calm, and uninterrupted time and place. *Do not* do this right before the wedding or during a celebratory event.
        *   **Be direct and honest:**  Don't minimize or sugarcoat what happened.  Take full responsibility.
        *   **Focus on your actions, not blaming her:**  ""I made a series of bad choices,"" not ""You don't give me enough attention.""
        *   **Express remorse and regret:**  Show genuine sorrow for the pain you've caused.
        *   **Be prepared for her reaction"
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",Absolutely not.  I strongly recommending working on one issue/need at a time.  In therapy you will set smart goals and objectives that will help you reach your goals.  I see you as a survivor and not a victim.  Best wishes to you.,"Okay, that's a *lot* to carry, and it's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge all of this. You are absolutely not alone in having multiple, complex issues. And to have navigated life with all of this, *and* maintain a 35-year marriage? That speaks volumes about your strength and resilience.

Let me directly answer your question: **No, you absolutely do *not* have too many issues to address in counseling.**  That's a very common concern, and a misconception about how therapy works.  Therapists are *trained* to work with complexity. It's not about ""fixing"" everything at once, it's about understanding how these things interconnect and addressing what's most pressing *for you* at any given time.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of why, and how a therapist can help, specifically given your history:

**Why it's okay (and *good*) to bring everything up:**

* **Interconnectedness:** All of these issues are likely interwoven. The sexual abuse history can profoundly impact self-esteem, contribute to anxiety and depression, and even affect sleep.  The breast cancer experience is *traumatic* in itself, and can bring up feelings of vulnerability, fear, and body image issues that layer onto existing challenges.  Insomnia exacerbates everything – it makes emotional regulation harder, worsens depression and anxiety, and impacts physical health. A good therapist will understand these connections.
* **Cumulative Impact:** Years of unresolved trauma and emotional distress build up.  Ignoring these things doesn't make them go away; it often allows them to manifest in other ways (like anxiety now appearing).
* **Your History Matters:** Your entire life experience shapes who you are.  A therapist needs the full picture to understand your patterns, coping mechanisms, and what's truly driving your current difficulties.
* **It's About *Your* Pace:** You don't have to unpack everything in the first session (or even the first year!). Therapy is a collaborative process. You get to decide what feels safe to explore and when.
* **Good therapists specialize:** Many therapists specialize in trauma, cancer survivorship, anxiety, depression, and relational issues. Finding someone with the right expertise can make a huge difference.



**How a therapist might approach this with you:**

1. **Building Trust & Safety:** The first few sessions will likely focus on establishing a safe and trusting relationship. This is *crucial*, especially given your history of abuse. You need to feel comfortable enough to share at your own pace.
2. **Assessment:** The therapist will gently gather information about all the areas you mentioned – the abuse, the cancer journey, the insomnia, the depression, the anxiety, and your marriage.  They'll likely ask about your history, your current symptoms, your support system, and your goals for therapy.
3. **Prioritization (Together):** You and the therapist will work *together* to identify what feels most urgent or impactful right now.  Maybe it's the increasing anxiety.  Maybe it's the insomnia.  Maybe it's starting to process the trauma. There’s no right answer.
4. **Treatment Approaches:** Depending on your needs and the therapist's approach, you might explore:
   * **Trauma-Informed Therapy:**  Techniques like EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), or Somatic Experiencing can help process the trauma in a safe and effective way. *Important: Trauma work should be done with a therapist specifically trained in these modalities.*
   * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  CBT can help identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors contributing to depression and anxiety.
   * **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):**  ACT focuses on accepting difficult thoughts and feelings and committing to values-driven action, even in the presence of distress.
   * **Mindfulness-Based Therapies:**  These can help with anxiety, insomnia, and emotional regulation.
   * **Sleep Hygiene Strategies & CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia):**  To address the long-term insomnia.
   * **Couples Therapy (Potentially):** While you say your marriage is happy, exploring how these individual challenges impact the relationship *could* be beneficial, with your consent.  It's not necessarily required, but could strengthen your connection.
5. **Pace & Flexibility:**  The therapist will continually check in with you to ensure you're feeling safe and supported. The plan can be adjusted as needed.  Sometimes you might need to focus on coping skills for a while before diving into deeper trauma work.




**Regarding your happy marriage:**  That's a huge strength!  It's wonderful that you have that support. A therapist isn't trying to ""fix"" your"
"I have three siblings. My mom loves them and not me. She’s always yelling at me, but when it comes to my siblings, she talks to them. I’m always crying in my room.","Have you ever tried talking with her about this when she's not angry? While I hear you saying that it feels like she doesn't love you, there could be a lot of other pieces to this. Have you ever told her about how much she means to you (when she's not angry)?","Okay, this sounds incredibly painful, and I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's absolutely understandable why you're crying and feeling hurt. It's a deeply upsetting experience to feel like your mother doesn't love you the same way she loves your siblings.  It's brave of you to even acknowledge this and reach out.  Here's a breakdown of how to think about this, and what you can do, broken down into sections.  It's a long response, but I want to be thorough.

**1. Understanding What's Happening (It's Not About You, Even Though It Feels Like It)**

*   **It's not your fault.** This is the most important thing to understand.  A parent's love (or lack of consistent, healthy love) for a child is a *reflection of the parent's own issues*, not a reflection of the child's worth.  It's rooted in her own history, her own emotional state, and potentially unresolved issues she has. You haven't *done* something to deserve this; it's happening *to* you.
*   **Differential Treatment is Harmful:** What you're describing – consistently different treatment between siblings – is called differential treatment, and it's a form of emotional abuse. It can have lasting effects on self-esteem, mental health, and relationships.  It's *not* okay.
*   **Possible Reasons (Not Excuses, but Understanding):**  While it doesn't make it right, understanding *why* a parent might behave this way can sometimes help you cope.  Some possibilities (again, these are *not* justifications for her behavior):
    *   **She might be projecting:** Maybe she sees something in you that reminds her of someone she dislikes, or a difficult time in her own life.
    *   **She might have unrealistic expectations:**  Perhaps she has a specific idea of what you *should* be like, and is critical when you don't fit that mold.
    *   **She might be struggling with her own mental health:** Depression, anxiety, or other issues can significantly impact a parent's ability to connect with their children.
    *  **Birth Order/Dynamics:** Sometimes, though not always healthily, parents fall into patterns with birth order.
    *   **She may be unaware of the impact:** It's possible, though difficult to believe if the pattern is strong, she doesn't realize how much her behavior is hurting you. (This doesn't excuse it, but explains a potential lack of intentional malice).
*   **Your Feelings are Valid:**  Feeling sad, hurt, angry, confused, and worthless are all completely normal responses to this situation.  Don't minimize your pain.  Allow yourself to feel these emotions.



**2. What You Can Do - Practical Steps**

This is where things get tricky, as it depends on your age and living situation. I'll cover a few scenarios.

*   **If You're a Minor Living at Home (Under 18):** This is the hardest situation.
    *   **Identify Safe Adults:**  Is there another relative (grandparent, aunt, uncle) you trust? A teacher, school counselor, coach, or family friend?  Talk to them about what's happening.  You need a supportive adult who can listen and offer guidance.  *Do not keep this bottled up.*
    *   **Grey Rock Method:** This is a coping mechanism to minimize conflict. When your mom starts yelling, respond with very short, neutral answers.  Don't engage in arguments.  ""Okay,"" ""I understand,"" ""I'll think about that.""  The goal is to be uninteresting to her negativity.  It doesn't *solve* the problem, but it can protect you in the moment.
    *   **Limit Interaction (When Possible):**  Without being rude, try to spend less time directly interacting with your mom.  Focus on school, hobbies, and spending time with friends.
    *   **Focus on Self-Care:**  This is *crucial*.  Since you're crying in your room, you clearly need to prioritize things that make you feel good, even small ones.  Listen to music, read, write, exercise, draw, spend time in nature, whatever brings you a little peace.
    *   **Journaling:**  Writing down your feelings can be incredibly therapeutic. It's a safe space to express yourself without fear of judgment.
    *   **School Counselor/Therapist:**  If possible, see a school counselor or therapist.  They can provide a safe space to process your emotions and develop coping strategies.  (Even a few sessions can be helpful.)
    *  **Don't Try to ""Fix"" Her"
"I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I can't afford to live alone.
   My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules. She is trying to control my life. What should I do?","That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now. The first thing to under is that you can’t change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior. The thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions.  You may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan. The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior. Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy. Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack.  There are ways you can deal with controlling parents – and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you’ll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they’re trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you’re losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust.

It's tough balancing the need for independence with the reality of financial constraints. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, broken down into sections: **Understanding the Situation, Communication Strategies, Setting Boundaries, Financial Planning, and When to Consider Other Options.**  I'll also add a section on **Self-Care** because this is stressful.

**1. Understanding the Situation**

* **It's understandable she has rules:** Your mom likely feels a sense of responsibility for you, and having rules is her way of exerting that care (even if it feels controlling). She's providing a significant benefit by letting you live there rent-free (or at a reduced cost), and in her mind, that comes with some expectation of compliance.
* **Developmental Stage:** Early 20s are a crucial time for establishing independence and identity. It's natural to want more control over your life.  Your mom might not fully grasp how strongly you feel this need.
* **Control vs. Concern:** Try to identify *what* specifically feels controlling. Is it about curfews? Dating choices? Career paths? How you spend your time? Is she genuinely worried about your well-being, or is it about her preferences? This distinction is important.
* **Your Contribution:**  Are you contributing to the household in ways *other* than rent? Chores, groceries, helping with family responsibilities?  This can be a factor in the dynamic.



**2. Communication Strategies**

* **Choose the Right Time:** Don't try to have this conversation when you're both stressed, angry, or rushed. Pick a calm moment when you can both sit down and talk without interruptions.
* **""I"" Statements:**  This is *crucial*.  Instead of ""You're always trying to control me!"" try ""I feel stifled when I'm told what to do with my free time.""  Focus on your feelings, not her actions.
* **Express Gratitude:** Start by acknowledging her generosity. ""Mom, I really appreciate you letting me live here. It's a huge help, and I know you're looking out for me.""
* **Explain Your Needs:**  ""I'm trying to become more independent as I figure out my life.  I need some space to make my own decisions, even if they're not what you would choose.""
* **Active Listening:**  Really *hear* her response.  What are her underlying concerns?  Let her explain her perspective without interrupting.  Ask clarifying questions like, ""Can you help me understand why that's important to you?""
* **Find Common Ground:** Is there a way to compromise?  Maybe you agree to check in with her about your plans, but she respects your final decision.
* **Be Respectful, But Firm:**  You can be grateful and respectful while still asserting your needs. Avoid getting into shouting matches or being overly emotional.




**3. Setting Boundaries**

* **Identify Your Non-Negotiables:** What are the things you absolutely need to have control over?  Your social life? Your career choices? Your finances?
* **Communicate Boundaries Clearly:** ""Mom, I'm happy to discuss my career plans with you, but ultimately, the decision is mine."" Or, ""I understand you're concerned about my dating life, but I need to choose who I spend my time with.""
* **Consistent Enforcement:**  This is the hardest part.  If you set a boundary, you have to consistently uphold it.  If she crosses it, gently but firmly remind her of the boundary.  (Example: ""Mom, we talked about me making my own decisions about this. I appreciate your input, but I'm going to do what I feel is best."")
* **Expect Pushback:** She's used to things being a certain way.  She may test your boundaries.  Don't give in easily.
* **Start Small:** Don't try to overhaul everything at once. Pick one or two key areas to focus on.

**4. Financial Planning**

This is the core of the situation. The more financially independent you become, the more leverage you have in setting boundaries.

* **Budgeting:** Create a detailed budget to track your income and expenses.  Where is your money going?
* **Saving:**  Prioritize saving for a down payment on an apartment, or for first/last month's rent and a security deposit. Even small amounts add up.
* **Increase Income:**  Look for ways to increase your income.  A second job, freelance work, or upskilling to qualify for a higher-paying position.
* **Reduce Expenses:**  Identify areas where you can cut back.  Eating out less, entertainment, unnecessary subscriptions"
"I keep getting into relationships with men that are in bad situations. I take them on and help them and do all I can and the relationship still fails. How do I learn to not get in relationships with men in bad situations? I see someone in need of help, I jump in. And it is getting me nowhere. I am alone sad and frustrated.","Sounds like you already see what's amiss. You're looking for fix-er-uppers! When you meet these men they need you. And you're filled by fixing them.  And when they are fixed, what do they have to give you? What's your need in relationship? What if you found someone who didn't need fixing? ","Okay, this is a really common pattern, and it's *incredibly* insightful of you to recognize it. It takes a lot of self-awareness to admit you're repeatedly falling into this dynamic. You're essentially becoming a rescuer, and while your compassion is a beautiful quality, it's backfiring in your romantic life. Let's break down why this happens and, more importantly, how to change it.  This will be a bit lengthy, but I want to cover it thoroughly.

**1. Understanding the Pattern: Why It Happens**

* **The Rescuer Archetype:** You seem to embody the ""rescuer"" archetype.  Rescuers often feel good about themselves *when* they are helping others. It can boost self-esteem, give a sense of purpose, and temporarily distract from their own needs.  However, the rescue is often about *your* needs, not the other person's.  It's about *you* feeling good by fixing someone else.
* **Unconscious Motivations:**  Dig deeper. What need does this fulfill for *you*? 
    * **Low Self-Esteem:** Do you feel you need to *earn* love by being helpful?  Do you believe you're not worthy of someone who's already ""whole""?
    * **Familiarity:**  Sometimes, we unconsciously recreate dynamics from our past (childhood, previous relationships). Were you in a caretaking role in your family? Did you have to ""fix"" things for a parent or sibling?  This can create a subconscious expectation of needing to do the same in romantic relationships.
    * **Control:**  Paradoxically, trying to ""help"" someone can be a way to exert control. You're focusing on *their* problems, which prevents you from dealing with your own, and you're directing the energy in the relationship.
    * **Avoiding Intimacy:** A relationship focused on ""fixing"" can be a way to avoid true emotional intimacy. It's easier to be a helper than to be vulnerable and really *seen*.
* **Red Flags You're Missing (or Dismissing):** When you see someone in a ""bad situation,"" you're likely focusing on the surface-level need, while ignoring warning signs. These could include:
    * **Lack of Accountability:** Does he take responsibility for his problems, or is it always someone else's fault?
    * **Unwillingness to Seek Help:** Is he actively working to improve his situation (therapy, job searching, addressing addiction, etc.), or is he relying solely on you?
    * **Repeated Patterns:** Has he been in similar bad situations before?  If so, that's a huge red flag.
    * **Love Bombing/Idealization followed by devaluation:** Does he sweep you off your feet initially, then become critical or distant?
    * **A general sense of ""too much too soon"" -** Sharing deep, heavy information very early on in the relationship.



**2. How to Break the Cycle: Practical Steps**

* **Self-Reflection & Therapy:**  This is *crucial*.  Understanding the *why* behind your pattern is the first step.  A therapist can help you explore your past, identify your unconscious motivations, and build healthier self-esteem.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be particularly helpful in challenging thought patterns.
* **Identify Your Values:** What do *you* want in a partner?  Beyond wanting someone who ""needs help,"" what qualities are important to you? (Kindness, ambition, emotional maturity, shared interests, etc.) Write these down.
* **Slow Down! (The Biggest One):**  This is the hardest part, but absolutely essential.  When you meet someone, consciously *pump the brakes*. 
    * **The 3-Month Rule (Flexible):**  Tell yourself you will not define the relationship or get deeply involved for at least three months. This gives you time to observe his behavior patterns without getting emotionally invested.  (Adjust the timeframe if needed, but the principle of slowing down is key.)
    * **No ""Fixing"" Allowed:**  A firm rule: you will *not* try to solve his problems.  You can be supportive (listening, offering encouragement), but you will not offer advice, money, or take on his responsibilities.
    * **Focus on *His* Actions, Not His Words:**  Pay attention to what he *does*, not what he *says* he'll do.  Talk is cheap. 
* **Recognize and Validate Your Own Needs:**  What do *you* need in a relationship?  What makes *you* happy?  Start prioritizing those things.  If a man doesn't contribute to your happiness and well-being, he's not a good fit"
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",Just go! You start with the most prevalent issue by talking with your therapist. Healing one issue can have a ripple effect and heal other issues as well.,"Okay, that's a *lot* to carry, and it's incredibly brave of you to even acknowledge it all and to consider seeking help. Absolutely, unequivocally, **you do NOT have too many issues to address in counseling.**  That's a common fear people have when they've lived through significant trauma and have complex experiences.  In fact, a skilled therapist will *expect* layers, and will be equipped to help you navigate them.

Here's a breakdown of why your concerns are understandable, and why therapy is still a fantastic (and necessary) step, along with some things to consider:

**Why It Feels Like ""Too Much"":**

* **Complexity:** You're dealing with trauma (sexual abuse, cancer), long-term mental health conditions (depression, insomnia, emerging anxiety), *and* the impact of those things on your self-esteem.  That *is* complex.
* **Long History:**  These aren't recent issues; they've been with you for a long time, which can feel overwhelming to untangle.  It's easy to think, ""Where do I even begin?""
* **Fear of Re-Traumatization:**  Talking about trauma is hard.  You might be afraid of reliving painful experiences.
* **Stigma & Shame:**  Especially with sexual abuse, there can be immense shame and fear of judgment.
* **The ""Fix It"" Mentality:**  Our culture often pushes the idea of quick fixes.  Healing from these kinds of things is a process, not a single event.



**Why Therapy *Can* and *Will* Help:**

* **Therapists are Trained for This:**  Good therapists are specifically trained to work with complex trauma, chronic illness, and co-occurring conditions.  They don't get flustered by ""a lot."" They understand how these issues intertwine.
* **It's Not About ""Fixing"" You:** Therapy isn't about being ""fixed."" It's about gaining understanding, developing coping mechanisms, processing emotions, and building resilience.  It's about empowering *you* to live a more fulfilling life.
* **You Don't Have to Tackle Everything at Once:** A good therapist will work with you to prioritize. You don't have to dump everything on the table in the first session.  You’ll work *with* them to figure out what feels safest and most pressing to address.  They will help you create a roadmap.
* **A Safe and Confidential Space:** Therapy provides a non-judgmental space to explore your feelings and experiences.
* **Your Marriage is a Strength:** The fact that you've had a happy marriage for 35 years is a huge asset! It shows you have capacity for connection, commitment, and likely, resilience.  Therapy can even *strengthen* your marriage by helping you communicate more effectively and understand yourself better.  (You can choose to keep therapy focused on your individual issues, or, *with your husband’s consent*, you could explore ways to bring him in to sessions.)




**What Kind of Therapy Might Be Helpful?**

Given your history, here are some approaches a therapist might use (they may combine them):

* **Trauma-Informed Therapy:**  This is essential. The therapist understands the impact of trauma and creates a safe environment.
* **EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing):**  Highly effective for processing traumatic memories.
* **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Helps identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors contributing to depression and anxiety.  Can also be helpful for insomnia.
* **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):**  Focuses on accepting difficult thoughts and feelings and committing to values-driven action.
* **Psychodynamic Therapy:** Explores how past experiences influence present behavior and emotions.
* **Somatic Experiencing:**  A body-oriented approach to releasing trauma held in the body.  (This is often done with specialized therapists.)



**How to Find a Therapist:**

* **Psychology Today:**  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists)  You can filter by location, insurance, specialties (look for trauma, depression, anxiety, cancer survivorship), and gender.
* **GoodTherapy.org:** [https://www.goodtherapy.org/](https://www.goodtherapy.org/)  Another directory with a focus on ethical and responsible therapy.
* **Your Insurance Provider:**  Check your insurance website or call them for a list of in-network therapists.
* **Cancer Support Organizations:** Many cancer organizations offer referrals to therapists with experience working with cancer survivors.
* **Ask Your Doctor:**  Your primary care physician may be able to recommend someone"
"My wife and mother are having tense disagreements. In the past, they’ve had minor differences. For example, my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing; my mother would complain my wife is lazy.
 However, it’s intensified lately. I think the cause is my wife talked back to her once. Now, any little disagreement is magnified, leading to major disagreements. What can I do?","One choice is for you and your wife to decide together what are reasonable ways and expectations to have of your mother.From what you write it sounds like your wife and you have differences as to what is the proper and right way to talk with your mother.Once the both of you agree on overall philosophy and some specific details for examples, then ask your mother to make time for all three of you to discuss together the expectations and standards you and your wife would like to see happen.This is only the first step since it is possible and likely that at least on a few points, your mother will disagree and have different views.These need to be discussed and integrated into an overall plan which all three of you are happy to live with.","Okay, this is a really common and difficult situation. It's good you're recognizing the escalation and wanting to do something about it. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, focusing on understanding, de-escalation, and setting boundaries.  It's going to require a delicate touch, patience, and consistent effort.  I'll break it down into sections: Understanding the Dynamics, Immediate Steps (De-escalation), Longer-Term Strategies (Boundaries & Communication), and Self-Care for You.

**1. Understanding the Dynamics**

* **The ""Talk Back"" Moment:** This is likely the pivotal point.  Even if your mother isn't *right* in feeling upset, it clearly deeply affected her.  In many cultures and families, a daughter-in-law ""talking back"" to a mother-in-law can be perceived as a huge breach of respect, regardless of the content of what was said.  It likely triggered underlying anxieties about her role and influence in your life.
* **Escalation Pattern:** You've pinpointed a key issue – the magnification of disagreements. This is classic conflict escalation.  It's like a snowball rolling downhill. Each small issue becomes larger because of the history and unaddressed feelings.
* **Underlying Issues:** The previous complaints (""overbearing"" vs. ""lazy"") weren't dealt with. They were likely simmering beneath the surface.  These are often about control, expectations, and differing values.  Your mother might be struggling to adjust to sharing her son, and your wife might feel her independence is being challenged.
* **Your Position:** You're in a tough spot. You love both of them and don't want to take sides.  Anything you say or do can be misinterpreted.  You *must* be neutral (as much as possible) in your actions, even if you have opinions on who is ""right.""



**2. Immediate Steps: De-escalation (When Conflict is Happening)**

These are things to do *in the moment* when you see things heating up.

* **Separate Them (First Line of Defense):**  This is the most important.  The moment you sense tension building, *gently* try to separate them. ""Mom, could you help me with something in the kitchen?""  ""Honey, I was hoping to get your opinion on something.""  Distraction is your friend.  Don't make it obvious you're trying to separate them *because* of the tension, but do it quickly.
* **Neutral Commentary:** If separation isn't immediately possible, offer neutral comments.  ""That's an interesting perspective.""  ""I can see why you both feel that way.""  ""Let's try to focus on finding a solution."" *Avoid* saying ""You're both being unreasonable.""
* **Validate Feelings (Without Taking Sides):**  ""Mom, I understand you're frustrated."" ""Honey, I can see you're feeling unheard.""  Validating *feelings* is different than agreeing with the *content* of what's being said.
* **Time Out:** If it's escalating rapidly, suggest a ""time out.""  ""I think we all need a few minutes to cool down and then revisit this.""  This is *not* a punishment, but a necessary pause.
* **Don't Get Drawn In:**  This is *crucial*.  Resist the urge to defend either one.  Resist the urge to explain their behavior.  You'll only make things worse.  A simple ""I'm not going to get in the middle of this"" is sometimes necessary.
* **Shift the Topic:**  If you can, steer the conversation to a completely different, neutral topic. ""Hey, did you see that [sports game/movie/news story]?""



**3. Longer-Term Strategies: Boundaries & Communication**

These are things you need to work on consistently, not just during conflicts.

* **Individual Conversations:**  This is where the real work happens.  You *must* have separate, private conversations with your wife and your mother.
    * **With Your Wife:**  Acknowledge her feelings.  ""I know it's been really stressful with my mom lately.  I appreciate you being patient.""  Ask her what *she* needs from *you* to feel more supported.  Help her brainstorm ways to respectfully communicate her needs to your mother *without* triggering a defensive reaction.  (e.g., using ""I feel"" statements: ""I feel overwhelmed when..."" instead of ""You always..."")
    * **With Your Mother:** This is trickier.  Acknowledge her feelings too.  ""Mom, I know you've been feeling hurt/upset lately.""  *Gently* explain that you love both her and your"
"I am on the track and softball team. My school is small, so I play all four sports it offers. I feel obligated to do track because I'm not a horrible runner, and my dad wants me to. The catch is is that the days before a track meet and the morning of, I get sick and cry.","It sounds like you are no longer committed to track emotionally.  It can be hard to talk to your dad about this, but he may think you love track and may not know you are getting so upset the days of meets.  An idea would be to first write a letter to your dad to see what feelings come out and then preparing to speak with him.  I think he will appreciate your honesty and maybe this conversation will bring you relief and also time to find something you really will enjoy.  ","Okay, this sounds really tough. You're carrying a lot! It's admirable that you're committed to your school and willing to participate in all the sports, but it's *very* clear something isn't right when it's consistently causing you physical and emotional distress. Let's break this down and figure out how to approach it. Here's a structured way to think through this, and some things you can do. I'll cover the emotional, the physical, and how to talk to people.

**1. Understanding What's Happening – It's Not Just About Track**

* **The Physical Symptoms (Getting Sick):** This is *not* normal. Consistent sickness before a stressful event is a huge red flag. It could be a few things:
    * **Stress-Induced Illness:** Your body is reacting to extreme stress with physical symptoms. This is common, and can manifest as nausea, stomach aches, headaches, even throwing up. It's your body's way of saying ""I'm overloaded.""
    * **Anxiety:**  The anticipation of the track meet is likely triggering significant anxiety. Anxiety can *absolutely* cause physical symptoms.
    * **Psychosomatic Response:** Your mind is so strongly associating track with stress that it's *creating* the physical response.  This isn't ""faking"" it; it's a genuine physical reaction driven by your mental state.
* **The Emotional Symptoms (Crying):**  Crying is a release of overwhelming emotion. In your case, it sounds like it’s a mixture of:
    * **Stress & Anxiety:** The pressure you feel to perform, the dread of the sickness, the conflicting obligations...it's a lot to hold in.
    * **Lack of Control:** You feel *obligated* to do something you don't genuinely want to do. That feeling of being stuck is incredibly frustrating and upsetting.
    * **Suppressed Feelings:** You likely haven’t been able to openly express your true feelings about track and your dad's expectations.

**2. Prioritizing Your Well-being – This is the Most Important Part**

You are experiencing a pattern of distress that's impacting your physical and emotional health.  This needs to be addressed. Your well-being comes *first*, even before school spirit or your dad’s wishes.  Think about it this way: you can't be a good teammate or student if you're consistently feeling sick and upset.

**3. Taking Action - What You Can Do**

Let’s break this down into steps:

* **Step 1: Document It.** For the next track meet (and even a practice), keep a very specific log.  Write down:
    * **What time did you start feeling anxious/stressed?**
    * **What were your thoughts at that time?** (e.g., ""I'm worried I'll let the team down,"" ""I don't want to feel sick again,"" ""My dad will be disappointed."")
    * **What physical symptoms did you experience and when?** (e.g., ""Stomach started hurting at 3 pm,"" ""Felt nauseous at 7 am,"" ""Started crying at 8 am"")
    * **What did you do to cope (if anything)?**
    * This log will be incredibly helpful when you talk to someone (see Step 3).
* **Step 2: Small Self-Care Steps *Now*.**  Start incorporating some small stress-reducing activities into your daily life, *regardless* of track:
    * **Deep Breathing Exercises:**  There are tons of free guided breathing exercises online (YouTube, apps like Calm or Headspace).  Practice these daily, even when you're *not* stressed.
    * **Mindfulness/Meditation:**  Even 5-10 minutes a day can help.
    * **Physical Activity You *Enjoy*:**  (Besides your sports!). Go for a walk, dance, bike ride – something purely for fun.
    * **Healthy Eating & Sleep:**  These are foundational for managing stress.
* **Step 3: Talk to Someone – This is Crucial.**  You *need* to talk to a trusted adult. Here are a few options, and a little about how to approach the conversation:
    * **School Counselor:** This is a great first step. They're trained to help students with these kinds of issues and can offer support and strategies.  Bring your log with you.  Say something like, ""I'm really struggling with track. I get physically sick and cry before meets, and I don't know why. I've been keeping a log of what happens, and I'd like your help figuring out how to deal with this.""
    * **School"
"I can't seem to feel any emotion except anxiety, not even for myself.","Empathy is the ability
to tap into our own experience to help us connect with others in order to be
aware of how they are experiencing life. 
It is a skill that we learn with practice and refine as we become mature.
If you are feeling anxious, maybe you are able to understand better others who
are going trough anxiety.  But I wonder
if instead of feeling empathy, you may just want to find ways to reduce your
anxiety.  A good idea is to be very aware
of your anxiety triggers, and once you identify them explore other ways you
could react. ¿Sera normal que no sienta empatía?Parece que no puedo experimentar ninguna otra emoción que
no sea ansiedad, ni si quiera por mí misma. Empatía es la habilidad de usar tus propias
experiencias para conectarte con otros y estar consciente de la manera que
ellos experimentan la vida.  Es una
destreza interpersonal que aprendemos y refinamos con la práctica y según maduramos
como personas.  Si te estás sintiendo
ansioso, tal vez puedas comprender mejor como otra persona experimenta momentos
de ansiedad.  Pero me pregunto si en
lugar de estar buscando sentir empatía, realmente quisieras reducir tus niveles
de ansiedad.  Una buena manera es estar consciente
que activa la ansiedad, y ya que lo identifiques, explora que otras reacciones
pudieras tener.","Okay, this sounds really tough. Feeling *only* anxiety, and even a disconnect from emotions regarding yourself, is a significant experience. It's good you're recognizing this and reaching out, even if it's just to put it into words here.  It's not ""normal"" to feel this way, and it definitely warrants attention. Here's a breakdown of what might be happening, why, and what you can do, broken down into sections.  Please read the **Important Disclaimer** at the end.

**1. Understanding What's Happening: Emotional Numbing & Alexithymia**

* **Emotional Numbing:** Anxiety, especially chronic anxiety, can sometimes lead to emotional numbing.  It's like your system gets overwhelmed and shuts down access to other feelings *as a protective mechanism*.  It's trying to prevent you from feeling even *more* distress.  Think of it like a circuit breaker tripping.  The anxiety is the overload, and numbing is the breaker.
* **Alexithymia:** This is a personality trait (and sometimes a symptom of other conditions) characterized by difficulty identifying and describing emotions.  People with alexithymia *aren't* necessarily lacking emotions, but they struggle to connect to them and put them into words.  It can feel like a blankness where feelings should be.
* **Depression's Role:** While you might not feel sadness *as* sadness, a lack of emotional range is a very common symptom of depression. Depression can manifest as emptiness, rather than overt sadness, and it can absolutely dampen all emotional experience.
* **Trauma:** Past trauma can significantly impact emotional processing.  Numbing can be a very common response to trauma, especially if it was prolonged or severe.
* **Burnout:**  Extreme and prolonged stress (burnout) can lead to emotional exhaustion and a feeling of emptiness.
* **Dissociation:**  This is a feeling of detachment from yourself, your thoughts, your body, or your surroundings.  It can be a coping mechanism for overwhelming stress or trauma, and can result in feeling emotionally flat.



**2. Why You Might Not Feel Emotions *For Yourself***

This is a crucial part of what you've described.  It suggests a potential disconnect from your sense of self. Here are some possibilities:

* **Self-Criticism & Shame:**  If you've been very self-critical or experience a lot of shame, you might have learned to suppress emotions that feel vulnerable or ""weak.""  You might be actively blocking out feelings *about* yourself to avoid confronting those critical thoughts.
* **Early Childhood Experiences:**  Experiences in childhood where your emotions were dismissed, invalidated, or punished can lead to difficulty recognizing and experiencing them later in life.  You might have learned that expressing feelings wasn't safe.
* **Attachment Issues:** Difficulties in early attachments can impact your ability to regulate emotions and form a strong sense of self.
* **Focus on External Validation:**  If you've consistently sought approval from others, you might have become disconnected from your own internal emotional cues. Your ""emotional compass"" points outward instead of inward.
* **Depersonalization:**  A symptom of anxiety or other mental health conditions where you feel detached from your own body or thoughts, like you're observing yourself from the outside.



**3. What You Can Do:  Steps to Take**

This won’t be a quick fix, but these are starting points.

* **Seek Professional Help:** *This is the most important step.*  A therapist (psychologist, counselor, psychiatrist) can help you explore the underlying causes of your emotional numbness and develop coping strategies.  They can assess if you have alexithymia, depression, anxiety disorder, or have experienced trauma.
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Can help you identify and challenge negative thought patterns that contribute to anxiety and emotional suppression.
    * **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):**  Focuses on emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and mindfulness.
    * **Somatic Experiencing/Trauma-Informed Therapy:**  If trauma is a factor, these therapies can help you process and release traumatic memories.
* **Start Small with Emotional Identification:**  Even if you don't *feel* a strong emotion, try to *name* what you think someone else might be feeling in a situation (watching a movie, observing people).  Then, gently ask yourself, ""Could I be feeling something similar?""  Even a tiny flicker of recognition is progress.  Use emotion wheels (easily found online) to help you find words.
* **Journaling:**  Don't focus on *feeling* the emotion. Focus on describing *physical sensations* in your body.  (e.g., ""My chest feels tight,"" ""My stomach is clenched,"" ""My jaw is tense"")."
"Sometimes, I'm fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth. I've always thought it was normal and I was just nervous, but the other day, it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter Target by myself.","I would suggest keeping a log of those days when you are having a hard time. Items to write would be what were you doing before you felt this way, did you eat and what, what time of day is it, how much sleep did you get that night, etc... This can help you identify any triggers. Further assessment can be made by a health care professional. It does sound like you are experiencing some symptoms of anxiety.","Okay, that sounds *really* tough, and it's good you're starting to question if it's ""just nervousness."" The fact that it's getting to the point where it's significantly impacting your daily life – like being unable to go into a Target for 30 minutes – definitely suggests it's worth looking into further. It's completely valid to feel like something isn't quite right, and you're right to explore that.

Here's a breakdown of what you're describing, what it *could* be, and what steps you could consider.  I'm not a medical professional, so this isn't a diagnosis, just information to help you understand and potentially advocate for yourself.

**What you're describing sounds a lot like anxiety, potentially Social Anxiety.**

* **Fluctuating Symptoms:**  The ""sometimes fine, sometimes not"" pattern is very common with anxiety. It's not always constant. Triggers can vary, and sometimes you might have enough coping mechanisms in the moment to manage.
* **Physical Symptoms:** Racing heart is a classic physical manifestation of anxiety.  It's your body going into ""fight or flight"" mode, even when there's no actual danger.
* **Cognitive Symptoms:** The inability to find words, feeling blocked, and the intense difficulty initiating a simple task (like walking into a store) are all cognitive symptoms of anxiety. Your brain is essentially overwhelmed.
* **Avoidance:**  Spending 30 minutes in your car working up the courage to go into Target is a clear example of *avoidance* behavior. This is a very common coping mechanism for anxiety, but it unfortunately reinforces the anxiety in the long run.
* **It's *not* just being ""nervous"":**  Normal nervousness is usually short-lived and tied to a specific event. What you're describing sounds more pervasive and significantly distressing.



**Possible Explanations (What it could be):**

* **Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia):** This is a very common anxiety disorder. It involves intense fear and avoidance of social situations because of the fear of being judged, embarrassed, or humiliated.  Even simple interactions, like checking out at a store, can be terrifying.
* **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):**  While often associated with more generalized worry, GAD can also manifest in physical symptoms like a racing heart and can lead to avoidance.
* **Panic Disorder:**  Although less likely based on your description, it's possible you're experiencing sub-clinical panic.  A full panic attack is very intense, but less severe episodes can also be debilitating.
* **Other Underlying Conditions:**  Sometimes, anxiety can be a symptom of other conditions (like thyroid problems, heart conditions, or even vitamin deficiencies).  It's good to rule these out.

**What you can do now – Steps to consider:**

1. **Talk to a Doctor (Primary Care Physician):**  This is the *most important* step.  Explain what you're experiencing, how long it's been going on, and how it's impacting your life. They can:
    * Rule out any medical causes for your symptoms.
    * Provide a referral to a mental health professional.
    * Discuss potential medication options (if appropriate – medication isn't always necessary, but it can be helpful for some people).

2. **Consider Therapy:**  A therapist specializing in anxiety can teach you coping mechanisms and help you address the underlying causes of your anxiety.  Common and effective therapies include:
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Helps you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to anxiety.  Often includes exposure therapy (gradually facing your fears).
    * **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):** Focuses on accepting anxious thoughts and feelings without struggling against them, and committing to actions aligned with your values.

3. **Self-Help Strategies (Can be used *in addition to* professional help):**
    * **Deep Breathing Exercises:**  Can help calm your nervous system in the moment.  (Look up ""diaphragmatic breathing"" or ""4-7-8 breathing"".)
    * **Mindfulness Meditation:**  Can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without judgment.
    * **Grounding Techniques:**  Help bring you back to the present moment when you're feeling overwhelmed. (e.g., the 5-4-3-2-1 method: name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste).
    * **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a helpful way to process them.
    * **Exercise:**  Regular physical activity is a natural"
"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","It is challenging to see one's parents age and to cope with the new demands.  Your mom means a lot to you, and that is why you get easily frustrated.  I'm guessing that it is not that she is making you do work or that her expectations are non-important to you because if that were the case, you would not feel any guilt.  Accepting the new stage will help you cope with the changes.  Take a deep breath every time you feel frustrated and think of the good times you shared with your mom before her getting Alzheimer's.  Remember that your mom as she was is no longer and that she has reverted to a more delicate phase.  Also, schedule time for yourself and do things that help you relax.  Caretaking of an elderly parent can take a toll on you, and it is essential to incorporate self-care.  Finally, look for an Alzheimer's support group in your area that will help you connect with other people going through the same thing.  You are a good daughter, and your mom is lucky to have you in her life.Sincerely, Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling","Okay, this is *incredibly* common. You are absolutely not alone in feeling this way. It's a heartbreaking situation, and the emotional rollercoaster of frustration, anger, guilt, and grief is exhausting.  It's wonderful that you recognize the disconnect between her behavior and her true self, and that you're seeking ways to cope. Here's a breakdown of how to navigate these feelings, broken down into understanding, coping strategies, and self-care.  It's a long answer, because this is a complex issue, but I'll try to be thorough.

**1. Understanding What's Happening in Her Brain**

* **The Disease, Not Her:**  You are right to feel guilty, but you need to *constantly* remind yourself that Alzheimer's is physically changing her brain. The areas responsible for personality, judgment, and impulse control are often affected early on. The ""her"" you're reacting to is being hijacked by the disease.  This isn't a deliberate attempt to be hurtful. It's the disease manifesting.  Think of it like someone having a stroke that impacts their speech or movement; you wouldn't be angry at them for slurring their words.
* **Frustration is a Symptom of the Disease:** The unrealistic requests and repetitive questioning aren't about *you*. They are a result of memory loss, confusion, and an inability to process information logically. Her brain is desperately trying to fill in gaps, and sometimes it latches onto things that don't make sense to you and me.
* **Emotional Dysregulation:** Alzheimer's can cause emotional dysregulation.  She might experience emotions more intensely and have difficulty managing them.  Small things can trigger disproportionate reactions.  She may not even *know* why she's feeling angry or upset.
* **Loss of Control:** She is losing control of her body and mind.  This is terrifying for her, even if she can’t articulate it.  The ""nasty"" behavior could be a manifestation of that fear and frustration.
* **Communication Breakdown:**  Her ability to understand and express herself is diminishing. This creates a frustrating loop for both of you.



**2. Coping Strategies *During* Interactions**

This is the hardest part. These are things to try in the moment when she's being difficult:

* **Validation, Not Logic:** Arguing or trying to reason with her is usually futile and will escalate things. Instead, *validate her feelings*, even if her request is nonsensical.  For example:
    * **Her:** ""I need to go home!  I have to get dinner ready for your father!"" (If your father is deceased).
    * **You (Instead of: ""Mom, Dad died 10 years ago!""):**  ""Oh, you're thinking about when you used to make dinner for Dad. That sounds lovely.  It was always so nice when you cooked for him.""  (Redirect, don't correct)
* **Redirection:** This is your best friend. Gently steer the conversation to a different topic.  ""That reminds me of a funny story..."" or ""Let's look at some pictures.""  Have a few go-to topics that she enjoys (even if it's a simple memory).
* **Distraction:** Offer a snack, a drink, music, or a simple activity.
* **Simplified Communication:**  Speak slowly, clearly, and use short sentences. Avoid complex questions.  ""Do you want tea or coffee?"" is better than ""What would you like to drink?""
* **The ""Therapeutic Lie"":**  This can feel wrong, but it's often the kindest approach.  If she's looking for someone who died, you can say, “They are visiting a friend right now and will be back later.”  Protecting her from distress is the priority.
* **Change Your Tone:** Even if you’re frustrated, try to maintain a calm, soothing tone of voice.
* **Take a Break (When Safe):**  If you feel yourself escalating, and it's safe to do so, excuse yourself. ""I need to check on something in the kitchen,"" or ""I'll be right back.""  Even 30 seconds can help you regain composure.  *Safety first - don't leave her unattended if she could wander or be at risk.*
* **Focus on the Underlying Need:** Sometimes the bizarre request is a symptom of something else. Is she lonely?  Bored?  Anxious?  Trying to address the underlying need might alleviate the behavior.

**3.  Coping with *Your* Feelings Afterward**

This is just as important as managing the interactions:

* **Acknowledge Your Emotions:** Don't suppress your anger or frustration.  It's okay to feel those things!  Say to"
Why am I attracted to older men?,"What a wonderful question!Good for you on clearly knowing your priorities.If I was sitting with you now, I'd ask you to list your reasons.Start with whatever answers you do come up with and examine each of these a little further.If, for example, you feel you need a man because many of your friends are in relationships, then possibly you feel insecure about being your unique self, even when this sets you apart from your friends.If, you feel you need a man to protect you financially, then possibly you've lost faith in your ability to financially support yourself.If you'd like a man in your life to offer your love and are willing to contribute the work of relating intimately, then you've found the best reason for wanting a man in your life.This is far different than ""need"".","Okay, let's explore the reasons why you might be attracted to older men. It's a really common preference, and there's a *lot* of potential psychology behind it. It's rarely just one thing! Here's a breakdown of factors, broken down into categories, from evolutionary to personal experience.  I'll try to be thorough, but remember this is general information, and *your* specific reasons are unique to you.  I'll also add a disclaimer at the end.

**1. Evolutionary & Biological Factors (These are often subconscious):**

*   **Resource Provisioning:** Historically (and often still today), older men tend to have more established careers, financial stability, and resources.  From an evolutionary perspective, this could be attractive as it signals the ability to provide and protect for offspring (even if you don't consciously want children, this ingrained pattern can still influence attraction). This isn't about being ""gold digger""-ish, it's a deeply rooted preference.
*   **Status & Authority:**  Older men often have higher social status, experience, and a sense of authority.  Some people are naturally drawn to those qualities as they can feel safe and secure in their presence.
*   **Maturity & Emotional Stability:**  Generally (though not always!), older men have more life experience and, with it, potentially greater emotional maturity. This can translate to better communication skills, a calmer demeanor, and a more predictable emotional response – which can be very appealing.  Less drama can be a huge draw.
*   **Genetic Fitness Indicators:** This is a more subtle evolutionary idea.  Signs of aging (like a strong jawline still visible, healthy hair, good posture *for their age*) can subconsciously signal good genes that have withstood the test of time.

**2. Psychological & Emotional Factors (These are often more conscious, but can be influenced by the subconscious):**

*   **Father Figure/Authority Dynamic:**  This is a big one, and can be complex.  If your relationship with your father was positive and supportive, you might unconsciously seek those qualities in a partner. *Conversely*, if your relationship with your father was strained or absent, you might be drawn to older men hoping to find the nurturing and guidance you missed.  (This doesn't mean you're looking for a *replacement* father, but the emotional needs can overlap).
*   **Desire for Mentorship & Guidance:**  Older men often have a wealth of knowledge and experience. You might be attracted to the idea of learning from them, receiving advice, and having a partner who can offer a different perspective on life.
*   **Feeling Protected & Cared For:**  The maturity and stability often associated with older men can create a sense of safety and security.  You might feel more comfortable and cherished in their presence.
*   **Avoiding Competition:**  Dating younger men can sometimes involve more ""game playing"" or competition. Some people prefer the straightforwardness and directness that can come with dating older men.
*   **Intellectual Connection:** Older men might have interests and conversational topics that resonate with you more deeply.  You might enjoy engaging in more thoughtful and stimulating conversations.
*    **Appreciation for Experience:** You might simply find the life stories, wisdom, and perspectives of older men fascinating and attractive.
*   **Self-Confidence & Independence:** Being attracted to older men can sometimes be linked to having a strong sense of self and knowing what you want.  You might be less influenced by societal expectations and more comfortable pursuing your own desires.

**3. Personal Experiences & Preferences:**

*   **Past Relationships:** Your past experiences with partners of different ages can shape your preferences. If you had a particularly positive experience with an older partner, you might be more likely to seek out similar relationships in the future.
*   **Social Circle/Exposure:** If you've grown up around or spent a lot of time with older men you admire, you might naturally be more attracted to them.
*   **Personal Values:**  Your values play a role. If you value qualities like wisdom, stability, and experience, you'll likely be drawn to people who embody those traits, regardless of age.
*   **Simply, You Just Are:**  Sometimes there isn't a deep, complex reason. You simply *like* what you like!  Attraction is subjective, and there's nothing wrong with having a preference for older men.



**Important Considerations & Things to Ask Yourself:**

*   **Are there patterns?**  Think about the ages of men you've been consistently drawn to. Is there a specific range? This can offer clues.
*   **What qualities specifically attract you?**  Is it their maturity, their confidence, their financial security, their life experience, or something else?  Be honest with yourself.
*   **Are you feeling pressure ("
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",You can be helped. Many of the people I see have multiple issues. These issues are often linked so that helping one issue will positively help the other issues.,"Okay, that is a *lot* to carry, and it's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge it all and consider counseling. You are absolutely not alone in having multiple, complex issues, and **you absolutely do NOT have too many issues to address in counseling.** That's a really common misconception. In fact, it's *more* common to present with multiple intertwined concerns than just one.

Here's a breakdown of why your concerns are absolutely workable in therapy, and how a therapist might approach it.  I'll also give you some things to think about when choosing a therapist.

**Why it's okay (and good!) to address everything:**

* **Everything is Connected:**  These experiences aren't isolated. The sexual abuse, the cancer experience, the insomnia, the depression, the anxiety, and even the long-term effects on your self-esteem are likely *all* interconnected.  Therapy can help you untangle those connections and understand how they influence each other. For example, trauma can contribute to both depression and anxiety.  Cancer treatment and the fear of recurrence can *also* contribute to anxiety and depression. Insomnia exacerbates everything.
* **Cumulative Impact:**  Living with these challenges for years (even decades) creates a cumulative impact.  Addressing them now, even after a long time, can still bring significant relief and healing.
* **Resilience & Strength:**  You've been happily married for 35 years *while* carrying this weight. That's a testament to your inner strength and resilience. Therapy can help you recognize and build on those strengths.
* **Therapists are Trained for Complexity:**  Good therapists are trained to work with complex trauma, chronic illness, and co-occurring conditions.  They don’t expect you to come in with just one neatly packaged problem.
* **It's About Your Pace:**  You don't have to tackle everything at once.  Therapy is a collaborative process. You and your therapist will work together to prioritize what feels most important to address *now*, and then move forward from there.



**How a Therapist Might Approach This (generally speaking):**

1. **Building Safety & Trust:**  The very first step will be establishing a safe and trusting relationship with the therapist. This is especially important given your history of sexual abuse.  You need to feel comfortable and safe enough to share vulnerable things.
2. **Assessment:** The therapist will likely spend the first few sessions doing a thorough assessment, asking questions about your history, your current symptoms, your coping mechanisms, and your goals for therapy.
3. **Prioritization:**  Together, you'll identify what feels most pressing to address first. This could be the anxiety, the insomnia, or perhaps processing some of the trauma.  There's no right or wrong answer.
4. **Trauma-Informed Care:**  Given your history of sexual abuse, a trauma-informed approach is crucial. This means the therapist will understand the impact of trauma on your brain and body and will tailor the therapy accordingly.  This *doesn't* necessarily mean you'll be immediately diving into the details of the abuse. It means the therapist will be mindful of potential triggers and will help you develop coping skills to manage them.
5. **Modalities (Types of Therapy):**  Several approaches could be helpful:
    * **EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing):**  Often used for trauma processing.
    * **CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy):**  Can help with anxiety, depression, and insomnia by changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.
    * **Mindfulness-Based Therapies:**  Help with managing anxiety, depression, and improving sleep.
    * **Somatic Experiencing:** Focuses on releasing trauma stored in the body.
    * **Psychodynamic Therapy:** Explores how past experiences influence present behaviors and feelings. (This might be helpful for understanding long-term patterns related to self-esteem.)
6. **Self-Care & Coping Skills:**  The therapist will help you develop coping skills to manage your symptoms, such as relaxation techniques, mindfulness exercises, and strategies for improving sleep hygiene.
7. **Focus on Strengths:**  Acknowledging and building upon your existing strengths (like the successful marriage) is vital.



**Choosing a Therapist - Important Considerations:**

* **Specialization:**  Look for a therapist who specializes in trauma, anxiety, depression, and ideally, has experience working with cancer survivors.
* **Therapeutic Approach:**  Research different therapy modalities to see what resonates with you.
* **Credentials & Licensing:**  Ensure the therapist is licensed and qualified to practice in your area. (e.g., LCSW, LMFT, PhD, PsyD).
* **""Fit"":**  This is *huge*.  You need to feel comfortable and safe with your therapist.  Many"
"I'm scared that I am with this man so I won't be alone. He should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case, and I don’t want to hurt him.","While not wanting to be alone may not be the best reason to be in a relationship, it is probably more common and normal a reason than you think.  Since you seem to care about your friend (""don't want to hurt him""), I imagine there are many other reasons that you are together.  I suggest that you talk about this open-heartedly with each other.  The idea of being afraid of being alone sounds like an honest starting place.  Don't try to ""figure out"" whether you should be with him.  Just talk.  The communication is likely to shine light on deepening connection for BOTH OF YOU.In the meantime, your idea that you don't deserve him is rooted in a ""core lie"" that you are telling yourself.  You can read about ""core lies"" and much more in my book, Living Yes, a Handbook for Being Human.  Check out www.LivingYes.org.Be easy on yourself.  You are deserving!~Mark","Okay, this is a really brave thing to admit, both to yourself and to even put into words. It takes a lot of self-awareness to recognize that you might be staying with someone out of fear of loneliness, and it's incredibly considerate of you to be worried about hurting him. Let's break this down, and I'll try to offer some helpful thoughts.  This is a complex situation, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed.  I'll try to be thorough.

**First: Validating Your Feelings**

* **It's incredibly common.**  The fear of being alone is a *very* powerful human emotion.  Our brains are wired for connection, and the thought of facing life solo can be terrifying.  You are absolutely not alone in feeling this way.
* **Recognizing it is the first step.** You've already done the hardest part – acknowledging the possibility that your motivations aren't entirely based on a strong, fulfilling connection.  That's huge.
* **It doesn't make you a bad person.**  Wanting companionship is natural.  Staying in a situation because of it doesn't automatically make you manipulative or dishonest. It makes you human.  However, it *does* mean you need to address the situation honestly, for both your and his sake.



**Let's unpack what you've said:**

* **""I'm scared that I am with this man so I won't be alone.""**  This is the core of the issue.  This implies that the connection isn't primarily built on love, deep compatibility, shared values, or a mutual desire to build a life *together*.  It's built on avoiding a feeling – loneliness.  This isn't a stable foundation for a healthy, long-term relationship.
* **""He should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case...""** This is your conscience talking, and it's a very kind impulse.  You recognize he deserves someone who chooses him wholeheartedly, not someone who's staying primarily out of fear. This shows you care about his happiness, even if it means it's not *with* you.
* **""...and I don’t want to hurt him.""**  This is also very considerate.  However, staying in a relationship that isn't right for either of you, out of fear, *will* likely cause more hurt in the long run.  It's a form of prolonged emotional dishonesty.



**What Can You Do?  A Path Forward**

Here's a breakdown of steps, from self-reflection to potential conversations.  I'll categorize them.  *Please read the ""Important Considerations"" section at the end before acting.*

**1. Deep Self-Reflection (This is crucial before talking to him):**

* **Identify *your* needs and wants:**  What does a fulfilling relationship look like to *you*? What are your core values? What are your long-term goals?  Is he aligned with these?  Be brutally honest with yourself.  Imagine your life in 5 years, with and without him. Which scenario feels more authentic and fulfilling?
* **Explore your fear of loneliness:**  *Why* are you so afraid of being alone?  Is it rooted in past experiences?  Low self-esteem?  Social pressure?  Identifying the root cause will help you address it.  Consider if therapy might be beneficial (see ""Resources"" at the end).
* **What *do* you feel for him?**  Separate the fear of being alone from your genuine feelings for him.  Do you enjoy his company?  Do you admire his qualities?  Is there attraction?  Is there a deep emotional connection?  If the answer to many of these is ""not really,"" that's important to acknowledge.
* **Journaling:**  Write down your thoughts and feelings.  This can help you clarify what's going on inside.
* **Time alone:** Intentionally spend time by yourself.  Do things you enjoy.  Rediscover your own identity outside of the relationship.  This can help you build confidence and realize that being alone isn't necessarily a bad thing.

**2.  Considering the Relationship's Health (Objectively):**

* **Is he happy?**  Really think about his demeanor, his words, his overall energy.  Does he seem truly content and fulfilled in the relationship?
* **Are your needs being met?**  Are you feeling supported, valued, and respected?  Or are you constantly compromising your own happiness to maintain the status quo?
* **Communication:** How is your communication? Can you honestly share your feelings with him? Does he listen and validate your concerns?
* **Future Vision:** Do you share a common vision for the future? Do you want the same things out of life?

**"
"I've known him for about six years. We've dated off and on. I hadn't seen him in close to three years but recently started seeing him again. I really want this to last this time. I stayed the night. Do I text, call, or make contact first, the same day of the morning I left his house?","It is possible your question reflects some insecurity about whether or not either or you would like this relationship to continue.Otherwise, the answer to your question would appear naturally.  If you genuinely feel close enough to this person to sleep with him, then who texts whom first, wouldn't really matter too much.Try to understand within yourself whether you feel truly interested in this person as much as you would like to feel toward someone.","Okay, this is a classic post-sleepover question! It's great you want this to last, and being thoughtful about initial contact is a good sign. Here's a breakdown of what to do, leaning towards what's most likely to build connection and avoid misinterpretation, considering the ""off and on"" history, and the desire for something lasting *this* time.

**My Recommendation: A Text - Later in the Day, Not First Thing**

Here's the reasoning, broken down, and then a few text examples:

* **Why *not* call right away:** Calling can feel a bit much this soon, especially given the on-again, off-again nature of the relationship. It can read as needing a lot of reassurance, or even a bit clingy (even if that's not your intention).  You want to build a sense of easy comfort, and a phone call can add pressure.
* **Why *not* text *immediately* upon leaving:**  Leaving and immediately texting can come across as rushing things. A little space is good. It shows you have your own life and aren't just hanging on his every move. It also allows *him* space to process and potentially initiate.
* **Why a text *later* in the day is best:**
    * **Acknowledges the time together:** It lets him know you enjoyed yourself.
    * **Allows him to initiate:** If he *was* going to text, this doesn't step on his toes.
    * **Low Pressure:** A text is casual and doesn't demand an immediate response.
    * **Gives you control:** You can craft a message that reflects *your* feelings and sets the tone you want.

**What to Say in the Text (Examples - Choose one that feels most like *you*):**

Here are a few options, ranging from more playful to more heartfelt.  I've also given a ""vibe check"" for each:

**Option 1: Playful & Light (Vibe: Fun, relaxed, gauging interest)**

> ""Hey! Had a really great time last night. Still recovering from [mention something specific you laughed about or did]. Hope you have a good day! 😊""

**Option 2:  Warm & Appreciative (Vibe:  Genuine, shows you enjoyed his company)**

> ""Good morning! Just wanted to say I really enjoyed spending time with you last night. It was great to catch up. Hope your day is off to a good start.""

**Option 3: A little more direct, showing investment (Vibe:  Interested in more, but not overwhelming)**

> ""Hey! Thinking about last night and realizing how much fun I had. It's really nice being around you. Hope you have a good day. 😊""

**Option 4: Short & Sweet (Vibe:  Casual, friendly, low-key)**

> ""Hey! Had a really fun night, thanks again. Hope you have a great day! ""

**Important Considerations & What To Do After You Send It:**

* **Don't overthink it:** Pick one and send it. Don't rewrite it 20 times.
* **Don't double-text:** Resist the urge to send another message if he doesn't respond immediately. Give him time. (This is *especially* important given the past history).
* **Match his energy:**  Pay attention to his response (when/if it comes). Is he enthusiastic?  Is he short and sweet?  Mirror his level of engagement. If he's brief, keep your next response brief too. If he's chatty, you can be more so.
* **Be Patient:** Seriously. Three years is a long time. Re-establishing a connection takes time and letting things unfold naturally is important.
* **Focus on yourself:** While you're waiting, keep yourself busy! Don't put your life on hold waiting for a text back.




**To help me tailor the advice even more, you could tell me:**

* **What was the vibe like *during* the time you spent together?** Was it flirty, comfortable, deep conversation, etc.?
* **How do *you* typically communicate?** Are you both usually texters, or do you prefer calls?
* **What are your biggest fears about this rekindled connection?**



Good luck! I hope this goes well for you.  You're right to be thoughtful about this."
"I keep having these random thoughts that I don't want. Things like ""you aren't worth anything."" I know they're my own thoughts but it feels like someone else is saying it.
   What is wrong with me, and how can I stop having these thoughts?","Many people have thoughts like those you describe, and often it feels like someone else is saying it because they are things that may have been said to you when you were very young.  When young children hear negative things about themselves they tend to internalize these negative ideas and to form negative core beliefs.  The good news is we can learn to stop these thoughts and to replace them with healthier thoughts.  The first step is to catch yourself when you are thinking these thoughts, and to stay ""stop!""; then replace it with another thought.  So for instance, maybe you fail a test or get rejected by a romantic interest.  You catch yourself saying ""you aren't worth anything"". Stop this thought, and replace it with ""You didn't do as well on that test as you would have liked.  Let's figure out how you can do better next time.""  Or ""she may not want to go out with you, but someone else will"". So the idea is to develop a voice of a ""friend"", who can tell you the kind of things you would say to your own best friend.  You might also pick up the book, Feeling Good, by David Burns. He gives many tips for how to change Negative Self Talk.","Okay, this is a really common and distressing experience, and you're very brave for acknowledging it and reaching out. It's good you recognize these thoughts *as* thoughts, even if they feel imposed. That's a really important first step. Let's break down what might be happening and how you can start to address it.  I'm going to give a fairly comprehensive answer, but please read the disclaimer at the end.

**What's Going On? (Possible Explanations)**

There are several things that could be contributing to these unwanted, negative thoughts.  It's rarely just ""something being wrong with you."" Here are some possibilities:

* **Intrusive Thoughts:** This is the most likely explanation. Intrusive thoughts are unwanted, involuntary thoughts, images, or urges that pop into your mind. They can be distressing, disturbing, and often contrary to your values. The feeling that they're ""not your own"" is *very* typical with intrusive thoughts.  Your brain is essentially getting ""stuck"" on a thought, even though you don't want it.  The content can vary widely – from violent imagery to worries about safety, to self-criticism like what you're experiencing.  *Everyone* experiences intrusive thoughts to some degree, but when they become frequent, distressing, and interfere with your life, that's when they become problematic.
* **Negative Self-Talk/Self-Criticism:** You might have a pattern of harsh self-judgment. This can stem from childhood experiences, past failures, societal pressures, or simply a negative mindset.  Over time, this internal critic can become very loud and persistent.
* **Anxiety:** Anxiety disorders are often accompanied by negative thought patterns. When you're anxious, your brain is in ""threat mode,"" and it can jump to negative conclusions and catastrophize.
* **Depression:**  Low mood and feelings of worthlessness are core symptoms of depression.  Negative thoughts are very common.
* **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** While often associated with compulsive behaviors (like hand-washing), OCD can also manifest as purely obsessional – meaning you experience intrusive thoughts without feeling driven to *act* on them.  The thoughts themselves cause significant anxiety and distress.  The ""someone else is saying it"" feeling can be strong with OCD.
* **Trauma:** Past traumatic experiences can leave you vulnerable to negative self-beliefs and intrusive thoughts.  These thoughts might be related to the trauma or be a general expression of feeling unsafe or unworthy.
* **Stress:** High levels of stress can exacerbate any of the above issues.  When you're overwhelmed, your brain is less able to regulate thoughts and emotions.



**Why They Feel Like They're Not Your Own**

This is key. The feeling that these thoughts are coming *from outside* yourself is because:

* **They're out of character:** They contradict your core beliefs about yourself. You *know* you're worthy, but the thought says otherwise. This creates a disconnect.
* **The speed and intensity:** They can appear suddenly and feel very forceful, making it seem like they're being imposed.
* **The emotional reaction:** The strong negative emotions they trigger can feel overwhelming and separate from your conscious mind.
* **Brain activity:**  Research suggests that in some people with intrusive thoughts (particularly OCD), there's different brain activity patterns compared to those without, which might contribute to this sense of foreignness.



**How to Stop (or at least Manage) These Thoughts - A Toolkit**

This will take practice and patience. There's no instant fix, but you can make significant progress.

1. **Acceptance and Labeling:**  Instead of fighting the thought (""No, that's not true!""), try acknowledging it: ""Okay, I'm having the thought that I'm worthless.""  Label it as an *intrusive thought* or a *negative thought*.  This creates distance.  Think of it like observing a cloud passing by – you notice it, but you don't get carried away by it.
2. **Don't Engage:** This is *crucial*.  Don't argue with the thought, analyze it, or try to figure out why you're having it.  That just gives it power.  Trying to suppress the thought often makes it worse (this is called the ""ironic process theory"").  Just let it be.
3. **Thought Defusion Techniques:** These help you separate yourself *from* your thoughts.
   * **""I am having the thought...""**  Instead of ""I am worthless,"" say ""I am having the thought that I am worthless.""
   * **Repeat the thought:** Say the thought over and over again, quickly, until it loses its emotional impact. It becomes just a string of words."
"I'm a guy. If I don't like girls, nor do I like guys, does that mean I'm gay?","Hi, and thanks for your question. I agree with my colleagues about researching asexuality, but I want too add a couple of things about that:Here is a website that you can start with to get some information about asexuality - http://www.asexuality.org/home/There are a whole lot of myths surrounding asexuality. One is that people who are asexual have absolutely no interest in sex, and that is not always the case. There are variations of asexuality. Some people who are asexual have an interest in sex and others don't. Also, once you read more on this topic, you may find that you don't connect with asexuality either, and that is okay. Our society usually thinks of sexual orientations as only being straight, gay, lesbian, or bisexual, but the truth is there are many variations of sexual orientations. Keep exploring. There is a good chance that there is a community of people who feel like you do. Finally, labels are important for a lot of things, but labeling ourselves can sometimes lead to some painful feelings. Try not to feel pressured to label yourself too quickly. This is your journey. Your experience. Take all the time you need. You may never feel the need to label how you feel, and that is okay, too. Hope this helps. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC  ","Okay, let's break this down. It's great you're asking this question and exploring your feelings. The simple answer is **no, not liking girls *or* guys doesn't automatically mean you're gay.**

Here's a more detailed explanation, covering different possibilities:

* **Asexual:** This is the most likely possibility. Asexuality is a sexual orientation characterized by a lack of sexual attraction to anyone. Asexual people don't experience sexual desire, or experience it very rarely.  It's *not* the same as celibacy (choosing not to have sex) or a lack of romantic attraction.  You can be asexual and still have romantic feelings for people.

* **Aromantic:** This describes a lack of *romantic* attraction. You might enjoy friendships, platonic connection, and intimacy without wanting a romantic relationship.  You can be aromantic and also asexual, or you can be aromantic and still experience sexual attraction (though possibly not to the typical degree or in typical ways).

* **Graysexual/Demi-sexual:** These fall on a spectrum.
    * **Graysexual** individuals experience sexual attraction very rarely, or only under specific circumstances.
    * **Demisexual** individuals only experience sexual attraction *after* forming a strong emotional connection with someone.

* **Pansexual/Bisexual with a low libido:** While pansexual and bisexual people are attracted to multiple genders, someone with a consistently low libido (sex drive) might not experience attraction strongly, or very often, regardless of gender.  However, the *potential* for attraction is still there.

* **Other possibilities:** Sometimes, a lack of attraction can stem from factors like:
    * **Trauma:** Past experiences can sometimes affect someone's ability to experience attraction.
    * **Mental health:** Conditions like depression or anxiety can lower libido and affect attraction.
    * **Personal Preference/Individual Variation:**  It’s also possible that your experience simply doesn’t fit neatly into established categories, and that’s okay too!  Attraction is complex.



**Important things to remember:**

* **Sexual orientation is about *attraction*.** It's who you're drawn to.  If you're not drawn to anyone, that's valid.
* **You don't *have* to fit into a label.** If a label doesn't feel right, you don't have to use it.  It's okay to just say you don't experience sexual attraction.
* **There's nothing wrong with you.**  Asexuality, aromanticism, and other variations are all normal and natural ways to be.
* **Exploration is key.** It's okay to take time to figure things out. Your feelings may evolve over time.



**Resources that might be helpful:**

* **The Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN):** [https://www.asexuality.org/](https://www.asexuality.org/) - A great resource for information about asexuality, aromanticism, and related identities.
* **The Trevor Project:** [https://www.thetrevorproject.org/](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/) -  If you're struggling with your identity or mental health, this organization offers support and crisis intervention.
* **Planned Parenthood:** [https://www.plannedparenthood.org/](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/) - Offers information about sexual orientation and sexual health.




**To help me understand better (and offer more tailored information, though I'm not a counselor!), could you tell me a little more about what you *do* experience?**  For example:

* Do you experience romantic attraction (do you fall in love, want to date, or feel deeply connected to people, regardless of gender)?
* Do you have any desire for physical intimacy (cuddling, holding hands, etc.) with anyone?
* Have you always felt this way, or is this a recent development?
* Are you distressed by this lack of attraction, or are you comfortable with it?



Ultimately, defining your own identity is a personal journey. Don't feel pressured to label yourself until you're ready, and don't let anyone tell you what you are or aren't."
"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years. I have been on medication, but lately my depression has felt worse. Can counseling help?","Thank you for asking this important question. I find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment. Step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change. Congratulations you did the first step! You are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question. Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression. The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with  Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events. Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression.  The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment. As counselors, we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time. However, remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well being. I hope this was helpful, and good luck with your treatment journey. ","Okay, it's really good that you're recognizing your depression is worsening, and it's smart to ask about adding counseling, especially when medication isn't feeling fully effective right now.  The short answer is **yes, counseling can absolutely help, often *especially* when combined with medication.** Here's a more detailed breakdown of how, why, and what to expect:

**Why Counseling Can Help When Medication Isn't Enough**

* **Medication addresses symptoms, counseling addresses causes:**  Medication often works by balancing brain chemistry, which can significantly reduce *symptoms* like sadness, worry, and sleep problems.  Counseling (also called therapy) dives deeper to explore the *underlying causes* of your depression and anxiety.  This might include past experiences, relationship patterns, negative thought patterns, coping mechanisms, and current life stressors.
* **Develop Coping Skills:** Counseling equips you with practical skills to manage difficult emotions, challenge negative thoughts, and navigate challenging situations. These are skills you carry with you *beyond* the therapy sessions.  Things like:
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques:**  Learning to identify and change negative thought patterns.
    * **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:**  Tools to manage anxiety and stress in the moment.
    * **Problem-Solving Skills:**  Approaching challenges in a more constructive way.
    * **Communication Skills:**  Improving your ability to express your needs and boundaries.
* **Explore Deeper Issues:**  Sometimes depression and anxiety are linked to unresolved trauma, grief, or difficult relationship dynamics.  Counseling provides a safe space to explore these issues at your own pace.
* **Increased Self-Awareness:** Therapy helps you understand yourself better – your triggers, your strengths, your vulnerabilities, and your patterns of behavior.
* **Personalized Approach:** A therapist can tailor their approach to *your* specific needs and experiences, something medication alone can't do.
* **Supportive Relationship:**  Having a non-judgmental, supportive relationship with a therapist can be incredibly validating and empowering.  It's a place to be truly heard and understood.
* **Medication Management Support:** A therapist can work *with* your psychiatrist or doctor to help optimize your medication. They can provide feedback on how the medication is affecting you and help you discuss any concerns with your doctor. (They cannot prescribe medication, only your doctor can.)



**Types of Counseling That Are Often Helpful for Depression & Anxiety:**

* **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Very common and effective. Focuses on changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.
* **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):**  Good for managing intense emotions, improving relationships, and developing distress tolerance.  Often used for people with trauma histories or borderline personality disorder, but helpful for anyone with emotional regulation difficulties.
* **Psychodynamic Therapy:** Explores unconscious patterns and past experiences to gain insight into current challenges.  (Tends to be longer-term.)
* **Interpersonal Therapy (IPT):** Focuses on improving relationships and social support.
* **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):**  Focuses on accepting difficult thoughts and feelings rather than fighting them, and committing to values-based action.
* **Humanistic Therapy (Person-Centered):** Emphasizes empathy, unconditional positive regard, and helping you reach your full potential.



**What to Expect When Starting Counseling:**

* **Initial Assessment:** The first few sessions will involve the therapist getting to know you – your history, your symptoms, your goals for therapy.  Be honest!
* **Building Rapport:** It's crucial to find a therapist you feel comfortable with.  Don't be afraid to ""shop around"" and try a few different therapists before settling on one.
* **Setting Goals:**  You and your therapist will work together to define specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals for therapy.
* **Regular Sessions:**  Typically, therapy sessions are 50-60 minutes long and occur weekly, though frequency can vary.
* **It Takes Time:** Therapy isn’t a quick fix. It takes time, effort, and commitment to see results.  Be patient with yourself and the process.
* **It Can Be Challenging:**  Therapy can bring up difficult emotions and memories.  It's okay to feel uncomfortable or even distressed at times.  A good therapist will help you navigate these challenges.




**How to Find a Counselor:**

* **Your Doctor/Psychiatrist:** They can often provide referrals.
* **Insurance Provider:**  Check your insurance company's website or call them to find in-network therapists.
* **Online Directories:**

"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","Thank you for sharing your question.  I imagine it feels overwhelming and discouraging at times if you feel like there are too many issues to address in a counseling session.  I would encourage you to share these concerns with a counselor because a counselor can help you organize the concerns into a list of specific goals.  For example, a list of goals may look similar to this:1.  ""I will learn about the effects of medication on the symptoms of depression and anxiety.""2.  ""I will learn about the factors that affect insomnia.""3.  ""I will learn about resources and support groups in my local area to help me cope with my traumatic experiences.""4.  ""I will practice self-care exercises each day and write about my thoughts and feelings in a journal so I can measure whether or not I""m making progress.""This is an example of some of the possible goals a counselor can help you work toward each week.  Working toward a specific goal can lead to a feeling of accomplishment once you've completed it, and this may have a positive impact on your self-esteem.  I hope this information helps, and I wish you all the best!","Okay, that's a *lot* to carry, and it's incredibly brave of you to even acknowledge it all and consider counseling. Absolutely, unequivocally **no, you do not have too many issues to address in counseling.** That's a very common misconception, and it's understandable why you'd feel that way - it *sounds* overwhelming. But that's exactly what counselors are trained to handle.

Here's a breakdown of why your concerns are valid, why it's *good* you're thinking about counseling, and how it can work, addressing each of your points:

**1. It's Not ""Too Much"" - It's Complex, and That's Okay.**

*   **Interconnectedness:** These issues aren't isolated.  The trauma of sexual abuse can absolutely contribute to depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.  Being a breast cancer survivor brings its own set of emotional and psychological challenges – fear of recurrence, body image issues, changes in life perspective, and potentially trauma from the treatment itself.  And chronic insomnia often fuels *both* depression and anxiety.  A good therapist will understand these connections and work *with* that complexity, not against it.
*   **Counseling is About Process, Not ""Fixing"":**  Therapy isn’t about ""fixing"" everything at once. It's a process of exploration, understanding, and developing coping mechanisms.  It's about building resilience and learning to manage the things that are impacting your life.
*   **You've Functioned with This For a Long Time:** The fact that you've maintained a 35-year marriage despite these challenges speaks volumes about your strength and resilience.  Counseling isn't about undoing that; it's about helping you build on it and improve your quality of life *further*.



**2.  Addressing Your Specific Issues:**

*   **Sexual Abuse:** This is a significant trauma, and processing it is crucial for healing.  Therapy can help you understand the impact it has had on your life, develop healthy boundaries, and work towards recovery.  *You do not have to have dealt with this on your own.*  It’s a common misconception that if time has passed, it’s ‘too late’ to address trauma – that is absolutely not true.
*   **Breast Cancer Survivorship:**  There's a unique emotional landscape for cancer survivors. Therapy can help you navigate the emotional fallout of your diagnosis and treatment, address fears about recurrence, and rediscover a sense of normalcy and empowerment.
*   **Insomnia:**  While sometimes medical intervention is needed, chronic insomnia is often deeply connected to emotional and psychological factors.  Therapy (specifically Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia - CBT-I) can provide strategies for improving sleep hygiene, addressing underlying anxieties, and changing thought patterns that contribute to sleeplessness.
*   **Depression & Anxiety:** These are treatable conditions.  Therapy can help you identify triggers, develop coping strategies, and explore the root causes of your feelings.
*   **Low Self-Esteem:** This often stems from a combination of life experiences, including trauma and chronic illness.  Therapy can help you challenge negative self-beliefs, build self-compassion, and recognize your strengths.
*    **Happy Marriage:** This is a fantastic foundation.  You can absolutely address your personal issues *without* negatively impacting your marriage.  In fact, addressing your own needs can *strengthen* your relationship.  You might even consider couples counseling at some point, but it's not a requirement to start with individual therapy.

**3.  How to Approach Counseling:**

*   **Start Small:** You don't need to tell your therapist *everything* in the first session.  Start with what feels most pressing or what you're most comfortable sharing. You can build trust and rapport over time.
*   **Find the Right Fit:**  This is *crucial*.  Different therapists have different specialties and approaches.  Look for someone with experience in trauma, cancer survivorship, and/or anxiety/depression.  Many therapists offer a brief phone consultation – use it to ask questions and see if you feel comfortable with their style.  (See resources below).
*   **Be Honest:**  This can be difficult, especially when dealing with sensitive topics. But the more honest you are with your therapist, the more effective the therapy will be.
*   **It Takes Time:**  Therapy is a journey, not a quick fix.  Be patient with yourself and the process.

"I broke up with him three weeks ago because I felt that he needed to be more respectful. He has since had a rebound relationship. He says he loves and misses me but refuses to see me. He says it's going to be too difficult to see me. Every time we talk, it feels like I'm being pushy to see him. He used to be so madly in love with me, but now, it seems like he couldn’t care less. I think I'm running him away.","Hi Kansas,I think your first instinct was good; you broke up with him. You deserve respect, but right now you're not acting as if you deserve it when you push to see him as he's moving on with a new relationship. It's appropriate now for you to respect that relationship and listen to what he says he wants, which is space. Do you think he's going to be any different with her? This a common, unfounded fear we have. I wonder if maybe you miss the feeling of being in love and having a partner more than you miss him. The bottom line is you can't make someone love you, and you can't make someone be loving towards you, because how someone treats you (and the choices they make) has everything to do with who they are, and nothing to do with who you are. I hope you gather support from others and move on in hope and strength for your own future.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's incredibly painful. It's completely understandable why you're feeling confused, hurt, and like you're doing something wrong. Let's break this down and try to get some clarity. You're right to recognize you might be contributing to him pulling away further, but it's *not* because you're inherently ""pushy."" It's about the dynamics at play here, and what his behavior is telling you.

Here's a detailed look at what's happening, why you're likely feeling this way, and what you can do:

**Understanding What's Happening:**

* **The Rebound is a Huge Factor:**  He's in a rebound relationship. This *significantly* colors everything. Rebounds are rarely about genuine, deep connection. They are often about filling a void, distracting from pain, and proving (to themselves) they can move on.  Anything he says while in a rebound needs to be taken with a huge grain of salt.  His ""love and miss you"" could be:
    * **Guilt:** He might feel guilty about moving on so quickly.
    * **Ego Boost:**  Hearing that you still have feelings might feel good to his ego.
    * **A way to avoid facing his own feelings:** Acknowledging his true feelings for you might be too difficult right now.
    * **Not genuine:** It genuinely might *feel* like love and missing you in the moment, but it's likely fueled by the loss and not a realistic assessment of a future together.
* **His Refusal to See You is a Clear Boundary (and a Strong Message):**  He's explicitly stating he can't handle seeing you. This is *his* choice, and it's important to respect that, even though it's incredibly hard.  His reasoning (""too difficult"") is vague, but the action (refusing to see you) is definitive. It suggests he needs space to navigate his current situation, and potentially, to truly detach from you.
* **The Shift in His Behavior is Normal (but Painful):** The ""madly in love"" phase is intense, but it's not sustainable long-term. Now, he's likely processing the breakup (however clumsily), and the rebound is providing a buffer.  It *feels* like he doesn't care because he's presenting a different facade, potentially to you, but also to himself and his new partner.
* **You're Right About Pushing:** You're perceptive. Every time you reach out trying to *see* him, you are inadvertently reinforcing the idea that he has permission to keep the door slightly ajar while simultaneously keeping you at a distance.  It allows him to feel good about receiving your attention without having to commit to anything. It also likely increases *his* anxiety, reinforcing his need to avoid you.



**Why You're Feeling This Way:**

* **Unresolved Feelings:** You clearly still have feelings for him, and it's natural to want closure or a chance to reconnect.
* **The Breakup Reason:** You broke up with him for a valid reason – lack of respect.  It's frustrating to see him seemingly disregard that issue by jumping into a rebound. You might be hoping he’s realized the error of his ways.
* **Rejection Sensitivity:** His mixed signals (saying he misses you but refusing to see you) are *designed* to keep you hooked. It's a classic push-pull dynamic that triggers rejection sensitivity.
* **Loss of Control:**  You initiated the breakup, but now you're feeling powerless to control the situation.  His actions are dictating how things unfold, and that's disorienting.




**What You Need to Do (This is the Hard Part):**

1. **STOP Initiating Contact:** This is the most crucial step.  Seriously. Stop texting, calling, emailing, social media stalking...everything.  Even responding to his texts if he initiates.  This is agonizing, but it’s essential.  You are giving him the space he *says* he needs, and you're also taking back your power. Every time you reach out, you reinforce the pattern.
2. **Accept His Boundary:**  He's told you he can't see you. Believe him.  Trying to convince him otherwise will only push him further away and make you feel worse.  Respecting his boundary, even though it hurts, is a sign of respect for yourself.
3. **Focus on *Your* Healing:** This is the time to invest in yourself.  This is about *you* moving forward, regardless of what he does.
    * **Grieve the Relationship:** Allow yourself to feel the sadness, anger, and disappointment.

"My dad cheated on my mom for 13 years. I cannot stop obsessing over the fact that my boyfriend might be cheating on me even when I know he isn't. I have full access to his phone, social media, and e-mails. I never find anything, but I'm obsessed with constantly checking just in case. How do I stop this? It's driving a wedge between us.","Hi Greenville, I respect that you're owning your own overreactions, and that you want to give your boyfriend the respect he deserves. The truth is that some people cheat, and some don't, and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they can't be trusted.The answer here is in two different areas. Basically, if you want to feel differently (more trusting, in your case), you look at your thoughts, and your behaviours.Your thoughts are stuck... like tires in deep ruts in the road. These thoughts are only habits, they don't reflect the truth. Fear is probably whispering in your ear things like ""everyone cheats"", or "" you're not enough for him"". Once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you, picture those words in red next time they come up. Ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought (there won't be much...perhaps none), and what is the evidence that doesn't support it (I know lots of good men, I know I deserve love and loyalty, there is no sign of infidelity...). You're learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear. That's the first half. Practise these thoughts.The rest of the work is in your behaviours. Act as though you trust him. Force yourself to not check or interrogate, and the less you check, the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel. Acting ""as if"" something if true strangely helps us believe it.It's possible to change the way we think, and this is turn changes the way we feel. Try this to start, and see a therapist for support and cognitive behavioural therapy if you want to dive more deeply into why this is happening and how to stop it. Good luck!","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's incredibly understandable why you're feeling this way. Your dad's betrayal has deeply impacted you, and it's completely natural that it's affecting your ability to trust in your current relationship. It's also really brave of you to recognize that this behavior is harmful and driving a wedge between you and your boyfriend. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, combining understanding the root of the problem with practical steps to take.  It's a process, so be patient with yourself.

**1. Understanding the Connection: Your Dad's Affair and Your Current Anxiety**

* **Learned Distrust:** You grew up witnessing a significant breach of trust. This doesn't mean everyone will betray you, but it *does* mean your brain has learned to be hyper-vigilant for signs of deceit.  For you, trust isn't a default assumption; it's something that has to be *proven* repeatedly.
* **Re-experiencing the Pain:** Obsessively checking your boyfriend's devices might be a way your mind is trying to regain control. It's a misguided attempt to prevent the pain you felt when discovering your dad's affair. You're essentially trying to ""catch"" a betrayal before it happens to you, hoping to avoid the same emotional devastation.
* **Unresolved Grief and Anger:** Have you fully processed the emotions surrounding your dad's affair?  There's often grief over the loss of the family you thought you had, anger towards your dad, and perhaps even sadness for your mom. These feelings can manifest as anxiety in other relationships.
* **It's Not About Him, It's About *You*:** This is crucial. Your obsessive checking isn't necessarily a reflection of your boyfriend's character. It's a reflection of *your* internal wounds.



**2.  Acknowledge the Problem and Its Impact**

* **Recognize the Cycle:**  You've already done this, which is fantastic. You see that the checking is obsessive, unproductive, and damaging your relationship.  Keep reinforcing this awareness.
* **The Cost of Checking:**  List out *specifically* how this behavior affects you and your boyfriend.  For example:
    *  ""I feel anxious and stressed all the time.""
    *  ""I'm constantly irritable with my boyfriend.""
    *  ""He feels distrusted and hurt.""
    *  ""I'm missing out on enjoying our time together.""
    * ""It's exhausting.""
* **It's a Violation (Even if You Feel Justified):** Even though you feel entitled to check because of your past, it's still a violation of your boyfriend's privacy.  Acknowledge that this is not a healthy foundation for a relationship. It erodes trust on *both* sides.



**3.  Stop the Checking - A Gradual Approach**

This is the hardest part, and going cold turkey might be too difficult.  A gradual approach is often more successful:

* **Phase 1: Reduce Access.**  The biggest step.  **You need to give him back his privacy.** This is non-negotiable. Delete saved passwords, remove access to his accounts, and *stop* looking.  This will be incredibly uncomfortable, but it’s essential. Tell him you are doing this because you recognize it’s unhealthy for *you* and the relationship.
* **Phase 2: Delay the Urge.** When you feel the urge to check, *delay* it. Start with 5 minutes. Then 10. Then 30.  During that time, distract yourself (see #4).  The urge will likely pass or diminish.
* **Phase 3: Replace with Healthy Coping Mechanisms.**  Instead of checking his phone, engage in something that soothes you or helps you regulate your emotions (see #4).
* **Be Accountable:** Tell your boyfriend you're working on this, and ask for his support (without asking him to constantly reassure you – that will fuel the anxiety).  He can gently remind you if he sees you slipping back into old patterns.

**4.  Develop Healthy Coping Mechanisms**

* **Therapy (Highly Recommended):**  This is the *most* important step.  A therapist can help you:
    *  Process the trauma of your dad's affair.
    *  Develop healthier coping mechanisms for anxiety.
    *  Explore the underlying causes of your distrust.
    *  Learn to build trust in a healthy way.
    *  Challenge negative thought patterns.  (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or CBT is often very helpful.)
* **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  These practices can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without getting carried away by them"
"I'm being verbally abused on a daily basis by my parents in front of my child. I feel like I’m trapped and I have no escape. I feel like I have to listen to the horrible things they say and just take all of it.
   I need some way of learning how to cope with listening to it especially since I have nowhere else to go. I feel very emotionally drained How can I deal with this?","Hello, I am sorry to hear about you feeling verbally abused, trapped without an escape, and emotionally drained. Sounds to me like you are being treated more like a child than an adult.  It's time to learn about healthy boundaries and being treated like an adult. This process will take time, but beyond elevating your self-esteem and worth, you will be modeling to your children a healthy adult. Model to them an empowered, confident, and person that is worthy of respect. Please invest in yourself. Find yourself a therapist that encourages and empowers you to have a voice and not feel invisible. You'll be so glad you did!","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult and painful. You're in a truly tough situation, being subjected to verbal abuse, *especially* with your child present, and feeling trapped with nowhere to go. It's completely understandable that you feel emotionally drained.  It's also incredibly brave of you to reach out and ask for help.  Here's a breakdown of coping strategies, focusing on what you can do *right now* given your limited options, and also some longer-term considerations.  I'll break it down into sections: **In the Moment, Protecting Your Child, Emotional Self-Care, and Long-Term Planning (even small steps).**  I'll also include a **Disclaimer** at the end, as this is serious and I'm not a substitute for professional help.

**1. In the Moment: Coping While It's Happening**

This is the hardest part.  Since you can't physically remove yourself easily, you need internal strategies.  These aren't about *stopping* the abuse (because you've said you can't right now), but about protecting *you* as much as possible *during* it.

*   **Grey Rock Method:** This is a common technique for dealing with abusive people.  The idea is to become as uninteresting and unresponsive as a grey rock.  Give short, neutral answers.  Avoid eye contact.  Don't engage in arguments or try to defend yourself.  Examples:
    *   Parent: ""You always mess things up!""
    *   You: ""Okay."" or ""I understand."" (said flatly, without emotion)
    *   Parent: ""Why are you so useless?""
    *   You: ""Perhaps."" or ""Maybe.""
*   **Mental Detachment:**  This takes practice.  Try to mentally observe the situation as if you're watching a movie.  Tell yourself, ""This is happening *to* me, but it doesn't define *me*.""  Visualize yourself surrounded by a protective bubble.  Focus on your breathing (see below).
*   **Breathing Exercises:**  Deep, slow breaths can help calm your nervous system.  Try the 4-7-8 technique: Inhale deeply for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale slowly for 8 seconds.  Repeat several times.  Do this *discreetly* if you have to.
*   **Internal Script:** Prepare a short, neutral phrase to repeat to yourself silently.  Something like, ""This will pass,"" ""I am strong,"" ""I am protecting my child,"" or ""This is not my fault.""
*   **Focus on Your Child:**  Shifting your focus to your child, even just briefly, can give you a small sense of purpose and distance from the abuse.  Silently send them love and reassurance.

**2. Protecting Your Child**

This is crucial.  Even if you can't stop the verbal attacks on you, you can minimize the impact on your child.

*   **Shielding:** Physically position yourself between your parents and your child when possible.  Don't let them direct the abuse *at* your child.
*   **Reassurance:**  *After* an incident (and when you're alone with your child), reassure them that they are loved and safe.  Don't badmouth your parents *to* your child, but you can say things like, ""Grandma/Grandpa is having a difficult time right now.""  Focus on your child's feelings.  ""Did that upset you? It's okay to feel sad/angry/confused.""
*   **Counter-Narrative:**  As your child gets older, gently offer a different perspective.  ""Sometimes people say hurtful things when they're upset. It doesn't mean those things are true.""
*   **Limit Exposure:**  If possible, try to create times when you and your child are alone with each other, away from your parents.  Even short periods can make a difference.
* **Model Healthy Behavior:** This is hard when you're being abused, but showing your child how to handle conflict respectfully (even if it's just internally) sets a positive example.

**3. Emotional Self-Care (Essential for Survival)**

You are being depleted.  You *must* find ways to replenish your emotional reserves, even small ones.

*   **Small Moments of Joy:**  Deliberately seek out small things that bring you pleasure.  A warm bath, a cup of tea, listening to music, reading a book, a short walk (even if it's just around the house).  These aren't luxuries; they're necessities.
*   **Journaling:**  Writing down your feelings can be a powerful release.  You don't have to write perfectly; just"
What makes a healthy marriage last?,"In my mind, a healthy marriage has two participants, meaning both people participate equally in the intimate connection of marriage. An unequal participation comes in many forms, such as one person checking out of conversations when it becomes emotional, or speaking over and for each other in these conversations. Couple’s should strive for engagement and support, but doing it in a way that works for each person individually. I hope this helps.","Okay, this is a *big* question! There's no single magic formula, but decades of research in relationships, combined with what people in successful long-term marriages report, points to a lot of key ingredients. Here's a breakdown, categorized for clarity.  I'll try to be thorough, but this will still be a fairly lengthy answer because it's a complex topic!  I'll also separate ""foundational"" elements from things that are ongoing work.

**I. Foundational Elements (Things you ideally have *before* or early in marriage)**

These are the things that make a good base for building a lasting connection.  If these are shaky, the rest of the work is *much* harder.

*   **Compatibility:** This isn't about having *everything* in common (that's unrealistic). It's about aligning on core values (family, religion, finances, life goals, politics – to a degree), having similar lifestyles, and genuinely enjoying each other's company.  Fundamental clashes here can be incredibly difficult to overcome.
*   **Mutual Respect:**  This is HUGE.  It means valuing your partner's opinions, feelings, and needs, even when you disagree.  It involves treating them with kindness, consideration, and politeness, *always*. Disrespect erodes trust and intimacy.
*   **Trust:**  Believing in your partner's honesty, reliability, and good intentions. This is earned over time through consistent behavior.  Infidelity isn't the only trust-breaker; dishonesty about finances, keeping secrets, or consistently failing to follow through on commitments can all damage trust.
*   **Emotional Maturity:**  Both partners need to be able to manage their own emotions, take responsibility for their actions, and communicate effectively.  This means not blaming, gaslighting, or shutting down during conflict.
*   **Realistic Expectations:**  Marriage isn't a fairytale.  It requires work, compromise, and acceptance of imperfections.  Believing that your partner will ""complete"" you or that marriage will magically fix your problems is a recipe for disappointment.
* **Healthy Individual Identity:** Coming into the marriage as whole people with your own interests, friends, and sense of self is crucial.  Losing yourself in the relationship can lead to resentment and codependency.



**II. Ongoing Work - The Habits & Skills of Lasting Marriages**

These are things you need to actively *do* throughout the marriage to keep it strong.

*   **Communication (The Cornerstone):** This is the most frequently cited factor in successful marriages.  But it's not just *talking*. It's:
    *   **Active Listening:** Truly hearing what your partner is saying, without interrupting, judging, or formulating your response.
    *   **Openness & Honesty:**  Sharing your thoughts and feelings, even when it's difficult.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Allowing yourself to be seen, flaws and all.
    *   **""Soft Start-Ups"":**  Beginning conversations gently, especially when addressing sensitive topics. (Avoid accusatory ""you"" statements).
    *   **Regular Check-Ins:**  Dedicated time to talk about the relationship itself – what's working, what's not, and what you both need.
*   **Conflict Management:**  Conflict is inevitable.  What matters is *how* you handle it.
    *   **Fair Fighting:**  Avoiding personal attacks, name-calling, and bringing up the past. Focus on the specific issue at hand.
    *   **Compromise:**  Being willing to meet your partner halfway.  Not every battle needs to be won.
    *   **Repair Attempts:**  Knowing how to de-escalate conflict and reconnect emotionally after a disagreement (apologizing, offering affection, using humor).
    * **Acceptance of Perpetual Problems:** Some issues will *always* be there.  Learning to manage these without letting them destroy the relationship is vital. (Benner's ""Perpetual Problems"" framework is helpful here).
*   **Affection & Intimacy:**  Physical and emotional closeness are essential.
    *   **Regular Physical Touch:**  Holding hands, hugging, kissing, sexual intimacy – these release bonding hormones and strengthen connection.
    *   **Acts of Service:**  Doing things for your partner to show them you care.
    *   **Quality Time:**  Spending uninterrupted time together, doing things you both enjoy.
    * **Emotional Intimacy:** Sharing feelings, vulnerabilities, and being truly seen by your partner.
*   **Appreciation & Gratitude:**  Expressing your appreciation for your partner, both verbally and through actions.  Focusing on the positive aspects of the relationship.  Small gestures of gratitude can go a long way.
*   **Shared Activities & Interests:**  Having"
"I know that I need to get past my feelings for this person I fell in love with, but t's so difficult to move on because he showed me feelings I've never felt before. 

I feel like I don't  want to be without my genuine love for him, but logically, I know I need to be without him. I can't discuss this with anybody in my life because the conditions surrounding our love are considered  ""wrong"" by a lot of people.

How can I get myself to just move on?","It's difficult to move on and let go, especially when you've experienced things for the first time with someone, or feelings you've never felt before, as you said.I like the fact that you are looking at your situation ""logically"".  Feelings can take time to fade, but you seem to understand, even if it is subconsciously, that it's the feelings he stirred up in you that are keeping you tied to him, not necessarily the person himself. Realize that you can and will experience those feelings again with another person - the RIGHT person. Don't hold onto someone who is wrong for you just because of something like this. You're wanting those feelings and wanting a relationship - but with him necessarily? Or with anybody? You said you don't want to be without your love for him - not you don't want to be without him. In fact, you said you know you need to be without him. It seems like it's the LOVE that you can't let go of, and the feelings. Not the person. Trust me, you will find that again. Take some time to let this fade. Don't try to force him or anyone else into a role that is meant for someone else. Cherish the memories and the experiences you had. Sounds like it's been a valuable learning and growth experience for you, but you have your own reasons, and I don't know what they are, for thinking this person isn't good for you. Trust your gut instinct and be glad you've had this relationship. Not all are meant to last. But all shape you into the person you are and will become, and all teach us important lessons.","Okay, this is *really* tough. You're in a uniquely painful spot, caught between the intensity of your feelings and the reality of the situation, compounded by the isolation of not being able to talk openly about it. It's completely understandable that you're struggling. It's not just about losing *him*, it's about losing the *feeling* itself, and that's incredibly hard. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, broken down into sections, with a focus on self-compassion and navigating the secrecy:

**1. Validate Your Feelings - The Core of It All**

* **It's okay to grieve the loss of the *feeling*.** You're right to acknowledge that it's not just the person, but the newness and depth of feeling you experienced. That feeling *was* real and valuable, even if the relationship isn't viable.  Allow yourself to mourn it.  Don’t minimize it by saying ""I shouldn't feel this way.""  You *do* feel this way, and that's valid.
* **Acknowledge the complexity.**  This isn't a simple breakup.  The ""wrongness"" adds layers of shame, guilt, and fear, which makes processing even harder.  Recognize that this is a particularly difficult situation, and be kind to yourself because of it.
* **Journaling (Private & Safe).**  Since you can’t talk to others, journaling is *crucial*. Write *everything*.  All the good, the bad, the confusing.  Don't censor yourself.  This is your safe space. Write letters you won't send.  Rant.  Explore your feelings without judgment.  Digital journaling (password protected) might feel safer than a physical journal if you're worried about discovery.

**2. Understanding the ""Why"" - Logically, Without Self-Blame**

You've already started this by recognizing logically you need to move on. Now, dig a little deeper *for yourself*, not to justify the situation to others, but to understand your own reasons.

* **List the Non-Negotiables:**  What specifically makes this relationship unworkable? Be brutally honest.  Not just the social implications, but anything that would cause long-term unhappiness or harm.  This isn't about flaws in *him*, but about incompatibility with a sustainable future. This list will be your anchor when emotions are high.
* **Focus on Your Values:** What are your core values? Does this relationship align with those values? If not, that’s a significant reason to move on, even if it hurts.
* **Future Self Perspective:** Imagine yourself a year, five years, ten years from now.  Would continuing this relationship lead to the life you want?  What life do you *want*?  Sometimes, envisioning the future clarifies what you need to do now.
* **Challenge Idealization:** When you think about him, are you seeing the full picture, or are you focusing on the best parts?  It’s easy to idealize someone, especially when the connection was intense.  Try to recall moments of friction, disappointment, or anything that didn't feel quite right.  (This isn't about demonizing him, but about grounding yourself in reality).



**3.  Creating Distance - A Gradual Process**

This is the hardest part, especially if there's ongoing contact.

* **No Contact (as much as possible):** This is the gold standard, but I understand it may not be entirely feasible given the circumstances. However, *minimize* contact as much as humanly possible. This means:
    * **No initiating contact.**
    * **Gray Rock Method:** If you *must* interact, be incredibly boring and neutral. Answer questions with brief, factual responses. Don't offer personal information.  The goal is to be uninteresting so he doesn't seek you out.
    * **Unfollow/Mute on Social Media:**  Out of sight, out of mind.  Seriously.  It will be painful initially, but essential.
    * **Avoid Places You Know He'll Be:**  This is about protecting yourself.
* **Break the Rituals:**  What routines or habits do you have that involve him (even in thought)?  Actively disrupt them.  Change your route to work, listen to different music, etc.
* **Physical Distance:**  If possible, create more physical distance. This could mean spending more time with friends (even if you can’t discuss the situation), taking up a new hobby in a different location, or even rearranging your living space.

**4.  Rebuilding Yourself - The Core of Moving Forward**

This is about shifting your focus *back* to you.

* **Self-Care is NOT Selfish:** This"
"I have lately been having lots of anxiety and self-loathing about the fact that I am a young adult virgin girl who has never had a boyfriend before. It seems like everyone my age has already had boyfriends by now or are not virgins anymore, and I just had my first kiss five months ago. I’m worried that, at this rate, I won’t have a boyfriend for a very long time. The problem is that I want to lose my virginity to my first boyfriend who cares about me, but at the same time, I don't want to be waiting forever in order to experience sex. I have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. Luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. I feel dirty by doing this, but I feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal.

Most people are surprised when they find out that I am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think I am really good looking. I am tall, I play lots of sports, and I get excellent grades in school. I am in my first year of university right now, and no guys have approached me to go out on a date or showed any interest. It bothers me. Most of the people in my family have been in relationships at my age already. I feel like I will be single forever sometimes.","I think that every person who has been single for any extended period of time has felt the same worries - myself included. Since relationships are so important to us we fear not having them and being single. It is similar to fearing that we won't ever get a good job when we have been out of work for awhile or fearing that we won't be healthy when we have been sick. We fear these things because they are so important - not because these fears are realistic or true! There is immense pressure put on young single people from peers and media to conform to ideas of what is normal and to meet expectations in terms of sexual experience, dating, etc. While some people may judge an adult who is a virgin - others will respect your choices and feel even more attracted to you because of your choices. Experimenting with sex, so long as you are being safe and respectful is also completely okay and normal. Since expectations vary and we can't be happy if we are always comparing ourselves to other people, we need to ultimately trust that being who we are and building a loving relationship with ourselves is the key to meeting someone who will cherish us for all the ways that we are special and unique, virgin or not. When we are able to really accept ourselves and trust in our loveableness (not a real word but you get what I mean!) then meeting someone special is simply a matter of time and effort - putting ourselves out in the world in situations where we are likely to meet other single people looking for relationships. When you are most afraid of being alone - remember that this fear is simply a reminder of how much you value relationships. Use that passion about wanting relationships to build the best relationship you can with yourself and then one day soon some lucky person will stumble into your life and benefit immensely from your passion and your ability to be authentically who you are rather than pretending to be ""normal"" or whatever that is anyway. Hope this helps! ","Okay, this is a lot, and it's incredibly brave of you to share all of this. It sounds like you're carrying a *huge* weight of anxiety and self-criticism, and it's completely understandable why you're feeling this way. Let's break down what you've said and talk through it.  I'll try to offer support and some ways to think about things differently.  Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am an AI and cannot provide therapy.

**First, Let's Validate Your Feelings:**

* **Your feelings are valid.** It's okay to feel anxious, frustrated, and even sad about not having had a boyfriend or sexual experience by a certain age. Societal pressure, comparison to peers, and family expectations can be really intense.  It's *normal* to feel this way, even if it doesn't *feel* normal to *you* right now.
* **You're not alone.**  You're experiencing a conflict many young adults face.  The idea of wanting intimacy and connection but also wanting to save something special for a meaningful relationship is very common.  The fact that you're feeling pressured to ""keep up"" with others is also incredibly common, fueled by social media and cultural narratives.
* **You recognize a discrepancy.** You’ve identified that you're actively wanting something (a relationship, intimacy) but your actions aren't aligning with your core values (wanting to save intimacy for someone you care about). This self-awareness is a *good* thing – it means you're capable of recognizing what truly matters to you.



**Let's Address the Specific Concerns:**

* **The ""Everyone Else"" Myth:** It *feels* like everyone else is coupled up. This is a cognitive distortion – we tend to only see what people *present* to the world.  Social media is a highlight reel, and even in real life, people often don't talk openly about their struggles with relationships or dating.  There are many people your age in similar situations.
* **The Pressure to ""Be Normal"":** This is *huge*. The idea of “normal” is a social construct, and it’s often unrealistic and harmful. You are trying to meet someone else’s standards, not your own. You are trying to validate your worth based on external factors (having a boyfriend, losing your virginity) rather than internal ones (your good qualities, accomplishments, and values).  You described yourself as tall, athletic, and academically successful – those are fantastic qualities! Your worth isn’t tied to your relationship status.
* **The Hookups & Feelings of Guilt:** You're being very honest about the hookups, and acknowledging the conflicting feelings (relief, then guilt and feeling ""dirty""). This is a sign that these encounters didn't align with your values.  It's good you recognize they left you feeling worse, not better. The pressure you felt to engage in these encounters is a symptom of the larger issue – the belief that you need to ""prove"" something.
* **The Worry About ""Forever"":**  Catastrophizing (""I'll be single forever"") is a common anxiety response.  It's unlikely to be true. Your first year of university is a HUGE transition. It takes time to adjust, meet people, and form meaningful connections.  



**Here are some things to consider and steps you can take:**

1. **Self-Compassion:**  This is the *most* important thing. Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend in this situation.  Challenge those negative self-talk patterns.  Instead of ""I'm so behind,"" try ""I'm on my own timeline, and that's okay.""

2. **Re-evaluate Your Motivation:**  Why are you pursuing these hookups? Is it truly about enjoyment, or is it about trying to alleviate the anxiety and pressure?  If it’s the latter, recognize that it's not working and that it’s creating more pain.

3. **Focus on *You*:**  Instead of obsessing over finding a boyfriend, invest in yourself.  
   * **Hobbies:** Pursue activities you genuinely enjoy. This is a great way to meet people who share your interests.
   * **Friendships:** Nurture your existing friendships. Strong friendships provide support and a sense of belonging.
   * **Personal Growth:** Focus on your studies, sports, or other goals.  Building your confidence and self-esteem will make you more attractive (not in a physical way, but in terms of your energy and self-assuredness).

4. **Challenge the Timeline:**  There is no ""right"" age for any of this.  Every person's journey is different.  Release yourself from the arbitrary deadline you've imposed.

"The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headaches—mostly mouth breathing and snoring. It makes me angry, and I want to solve it myself.","Probably good to know in what type of situations you are, in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoring.If you're sleeping beside your partner who does these actions, would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchen.Basically, if the person who does these actions which bother you, start by telling them.Depending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds, or not, willing to change, or not, has a good deal to do with next steps.I don't really see any step you're able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the head.One path I don't recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered, or dismissing your own sensitivity someone.Your needs matter.","Okay, this is really tough, and I'm glad you're acknowledging it and wanting to find solutions.  It sounds like you're experiencing **misophonia**, a condition where specific sounds trigger strong negative emotional and physiological responses. It's *very* common to feel anger, anxiety, and even physical symptoms like headaches.  It's good you want to address it yourself initially, but I'll also include information on when professional help is important.  Let's break down a plan, combining coping strategies and potential solutions.

**Understanding What's Happening (and Why It's Hard to 'Just Get Over It')**

* **It's Neurological:** Misophonia isn't just being ""annoyed.""  It's believed to involve a neurological difference in how your brain processes these specific sounds.  The auditory cortex (sound processing) gets overly connected to the emotional centers (amygdala). This means the sound isn't just heard; it's experienced as a threat, triggering a fight-or-flight response. This is why anger is common.
* **Triggers are Specific:** It's not *all* sounds. It’s usually very specific ones (like the ones you mentioned).  The fact that mouth breathing and snoring are major triggers is common - they often happen close to you, making them harder to ignore.
* **It’s Involuntary:** You don't *choose* to feel this way.  That's important to remember.  You're not being ""irrational.""



**I. Immediate Coping Strategies (For When You're Actively Triggered)**

These are things you can try *in the moment* when you hear the triggering sound. They won't 'cure' misophonia, but they can help you manage the immediate reaction.

* **The 3Rs (a classic misophonia technique):**
    * **Recognize:**  ""Okay, I'm being triggered right now. This is my misophonia.""  Naming it can reduce the intensity.
    * **Reframe:**  Try to change how you think about the sound. This is *hard*, but it's about challenging the automatic negative association.  Instead of ""This is awful and irritating,"" try, ""This is just a sound. It doesn't *mean* anything bad.""  Or, ""They probably don't even realize they're doing it.""
    * **Regulate:** This is about calming your nervous system.  Choose one of these:
        * **Deep Breathing:** Slow, deep breaths. Inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 6.
        * **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:**  Tense and release different muscle groups.
        * **Grounding Techniques:** (See section III)
        * **Mindfulness:** Focus on your senses (what you see, feel, smell) to bring yourself back to the present moment.

* **Distraction:**  This can be very effective, *especially* if you catch the trigger early.
    * **Music:**  Have a playlist ready of calming or engaging music. (Use headphones if possible - see section II on environment).
    * **Mental Math:**  Do a quick math problem.
    * **Visual Focus:**  Concentrate intensely on an object.
    * **Conversation:** Engage someone in conversation.

* **Temporary Removal:** If possible and appropriate, *briefly* remove yourself from the situation.  Even stepping into another room for a minute can help reset. *Don't* make a big show of it, as that can escalate your anger.



**II. Environmental Control (Proactive Strategies)**

This is about minimizing exposure to triggers as much as possible.

* **Headphones/Earplugs:**  This is your first line of defense.  Noise-canceling headphones are excellent, but even regular earplugs can help.  Experiment to see what works best.  Consider different types – foam, wax, custom-molded.
* **White Noise/Sound Masking:** A fan, white noise machine, or app can mask triggering sounds. Brown noise or pink noise might also be helpful.
* **Strategic Seating:** If you know someone is a mouth breather or snorer, try to position yourself away from them when possible.  This isn't always feasible, but it's worth considering.
* **Home Environment:**  Can you create a more soundproof space at home? Thick curtains, rugs, and upholstered furniture can absorb sound.
* **Communicate (Carefully):**  This is tricky.  Directly telling someone ""Your breathing is triggering me!"" is likely to be met with defensiveness.  Consider saying something like, ""I'm really sensitive to sounds right now, and I'm trying to create a calm environment."
I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.,"First I think we have to acknowledge that you are doing something amazing.  You are putting yourself out there and becoming a Water Safety Instructor.   We often times will focus on the negative and forget about the positive.  Next, you had an incident where someone pointed something out which may have caused embarrassment.  Whether or not it was malicious on his part I think the important thing to focus on is what is called ""Common Humanity"".  Common Humanity is one of the three elements of self-compassion.  Common humanity essentially recognizes that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the shared human experience.  While you may have had this embarrassing moment at this time, that boy may have had an embarrassing moment another day.  We all have embarrassing moments.  When we recognize that we do not suffer in isolation then we are able to move past that suffering.  Additionally another element to self-compassion is self-kindness.  My question is why must you forgive yourself?  Rather, be kind to yourself for learning an amazing new talent.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and I'm so sorry this happened to you. It's completely understandable that you're embarrassed. It's awful to be made to feel self-conscious, *especially* when you're trying to do something positive like becoming a Water Safety Instructor. Here's a breakdown of how to process this, what likely happened, and how to move forward, covering emotional support, practical steps, and how to handle similar situations in the future.  I'll try to be thorough.

**1. Validating Your Feelings**

*   **It's not your fault.** Absolutely none of this is your fault. You were put in a difficult position, and someone behaved inappropriately.  His comment was inappropriate, rude, and frankly, sexual harassment.  Even if the top *was* revealing (which isn't necessarily true, see below), *he* was the one with the problem, not you.
*   **Embarrassment is normal.**  Feeling embarrassed in this situation is a very natural reaction. It's a violation of personal space and boundaries. Allow yourself to feel those feelings without self-blame.
*   **You are brave for pursuing this certification.** Becoming a Water Safety Instructor is a responsible and admirable goal. Don't let this incident derail you.



**2. Understanding What Happened (and Why His Comment Was Wrong)**

*   **The power dynamic:** He's a student, you're (soon to be) in a position of authority and responsibility. His comment exploited that power imbalance. It was *not* okay for him to comment on your body or your clothing.
*   **""Displaying everything"" is subjective and loaded:**  That phrasing is incredibly suggestive and inappropriate. It's designed to make you feel shame and self-conscious. It's not a neutral observation.
*   **Swimsuit standards are tricky:**  Swimsuit requirements for WSI training vary, but they generally prioritize functionality and safety for *teaching*.  A secure, athletic top is key. It's entirely possible your top *was* within acceptable guidelines, and his comment was simply based on his own inappropriate thoughts. Even if it was slightly less coverage than ideal, that doesn't excuse his behavior.
* **Male entitlement:** Unfortunately, this situation is a reflection of a larger societal issue where some people feel entitled to comment on women's bodies. This does not make it right.



**3. What You Can Do Now**

*   **Talk to someone you trust:** This is the most important step.  Confide in a friend, family member, or another instructor.  Just voicing what happened can be incredibly helpful.  Don't keep it bottled up.
*   **Report it to the Course Instructor/Coordinator:** This is *crucial*.  You need to inform the person in charge of the WSI course.  They have a responsibility to maintain a safe and respectful learning environment.  Here's how you could approach it:
    *   **Write it down:** Before you talk to them, jot down exactly what happened, what he said, and when/where it occurred. This will help you stay focused and accurate.
    *   **Be direct:**  ""I need to report an incident of inappropriate behavior. During [class/break/etc.], [student's name] made a comment about my swimsuit, specifically saying it was 'displaying everything.' This made me feel incredibly uncomfortable and embarrassed.""
    *   **Focus on the impact:** ""This comment created a hostile learning environment and made it difficult for me to focus on the training.""
    *   **Ask what action will be taken:**  ""I'd like to know what steps will be taken to address this situation.""
    *  **They should take this seriously.** They may need to counsel the student, or potentially remove him from the course.
*   **Consider your organization's policies:** Many organizations (like the Red Cross, YMCA, etc.) have specific policies regarding harassment and inappropriate conduct. Familiarize yourself with these. Your course instructor should know them as well.
*   **Self-Care:** Do something kind for yourself. Take a relaxing bath, watch a favorite movie, spend time with loved ones.  This experience can be upsetting, and you deserve to prioritize your well-being.



**4.  Practical Steps for Future Classes/Teaching**

*   **Invest in a proper WSI swimsuit:**  If possible, get a swimsuit specifically designed for water rescue and instruction. These typically offer more coverage and support. Look for:
    *   **Athletic tops:**  These provide more security and are designed for movement. Tankinis with built-in bras are a good option.
    *   **Secure bottoms:**  Avoid anything that could easily slip or ride up during activity.
    *   **Darker colors"
I'm  very depressed. How do I find someone to talk to?,"If there is no one in your life with whom you feel comfortable, I would recommend identifying someone on this site, psychology today or goodtherapy.org who is in your area, then give that therapist a call to see if you would be a good match.  ","Okay, it takes a lot of courage to admit you're struggling with depression and to reach out for help. That's a really important first step, and I'm glad you did. It's absolutely okay to not be okay, and there are people who want to support you. Here's a breakdown of ways to find someone to talk to, broken down by immediacy and cost, with lots of options.

"My mother is combative with me when I say I don't want to talk with her about my depression.  

She hasn't been supportive of me in the past and she isn't someone that I feel comfortable opening up to. She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I don't want to or can't answer. I tell her I don't want to talk and she starts arguments with me. 

How can I get her to understand?","Your situation sounds extremely frustrating.You're doing the right move to state you don't want to discuss your depression with her.I guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression.  If you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation, and you would like to tell her your true reason, then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time, not in the middle of an argument.Having an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept.  You may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's incredibly valid that you're trying to protect yourself. It's *your* mental health, and you get to decide who you share it with. It's frustrating and hurtful when a parent doesn't respect those boundaries, especially when they're supposed to be a source of support. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, focusing on strategies, scripts, and understanding why this is happening (which doesn't excuse it, but can help you navigate it).

**1. Understanding the Dynamics (Why she might be reacting this way)**

Before diving into what *you* can do, it's helpful (though not essential) to consider *why* your mother is reacting this way. This isn't about excusing her behavior, but understanding it might help you predict it and respond more effectively. Some possibilities:

*   **She feels rejected:**  She might interpret your desire for privacy as a rejection of *her*, not just of sharing your feelings.  Parents sometimes equate being ""in the know"" with being close.
*   **She wants to ""fix"" things:** Some parents feel responsible for fixing their children's problems.  Your depression might feel like a problem *she* needs to solve, and your refusal to let her in feels like you're blocking her from helping.
*   **She doesn't understand depression:**  She might not grasp that depression isn't something you just ""talk away"" or that talking about it can sometimes make things worse if the listener isn't supportive.  She might think you *should* be able to just ""snap out of it.""
*   **Her own emotional issues:**  She might be projecting her own unresolved emotional issues onto you.  Sometimes, people ask intrusive questions because they're avoiding dealing with their own feelings.
* **Control:** She may be a controlling person and feels threatened by your boundaries.



**2.  Strategies for Setting and Maintaining Boundaries**

*   **Be Clear, Direct, and Concise:**  Avoid lengthy explanations or justifications.  The more you explain, the more room you give her to argue.  Keep it simple.
*   **""Broken Record"" Technique:**  Repeat your boundary calmly and consistently, even if she argues.  Don't get drawn into debating the *why* of your boundary.
*   **Focus on ""I"" Statements:**  Express your needs and feelings without blaming her.
*   **Accept that you can't control her reaction:** You can only control *your* behavior. She may still get upset, and that's on her, not you.
*   **Limit Contact (If Necessary):** If she consistently violates your boundaries, you may need to reduce the amount of time you spend with her or the ways you interact.
* **Have pre-planned responses:** Think about what you will say when she brings up the topic. This will help you avoid getting flustered and sticking to your boundaries.

**3.  Scripts & Examples**

Here are some scripts you can adapt, ranging from gentle to more firm, depending on your comfort level and your mother's personality.  **Practice these out loud!** It helps to feel comfortable saying them.

*   **Gentle but Firm:**
    *   ""Mom, I appreciate you caring, but I'm not going to talk about my depression right now.  I'm working through it in my own way.""
    *   ""I understand you want to help, but discussing this with you isn't helpful for me. I need to focus on my own process.""
    *   ""I'm not comfortable discussing this, and I'd like to change the subject.""
*   **More Direct:**
    *   ""Mom, I've asked you not to ask me about my depression.  When you do, it makes me uncomfortable, and I'm ending the conversation."" (And then *do* end the conversation - hang up the phone, leave the room, etc.)
    *   ""I'm not going to debate this with you.  I've made my boundaries clear. I need you to respect them.""
    *    “This is a private matter, and I'm not willing to discuss it with you. Continuing to ask me about it is disrespectful of my needs.”
*   **Responding to a Pushy Question:**
    *   **Her:** ""How are you *really* doing?""
    *   **You:** ""I'm managing. As I've said, I'm not going to discuss the details with you."" (Broken record)
    *   **Her:** ""But I'm your mother, I need to know!""
    *   **You:** ""I understand you feel that way, but my need for privacy is more"
"Over the years, I have slowly lost everything: my jobs, my cars, my freedom, and my money. I am a stay-at-home mom who doesn't make any money, doesn't have a car, never goes out, and cleans all day long everyday.","There are an infinite number of possibilities here. You included a lot of things that you don't have. Is there anyway that you can have some freedom for a few hours a week, at least? A lot of times stay at home moms have groups when they meet at different public places where their children can play together and they can talk together. I don't know how old your child or children is/are, but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the future.I wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you. I don't know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things. I wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted? If you can sort out some possible answers to that, maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happen.Also, again depending on the age of your children, some parents can do things while the children are sleeping, even if you are in the same room. For example, if your children are sleeping for about two hours, maybe 30 minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do.","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult, and it takes courage to even *say* this out loud. It sounds like you're feeling a profound sense of loss and are stuck in a really isolating and exhausting situation. It's completely understandable that you're reaching out, even just to put it into words.  Let's break this down, and I'll try to offer some thoughts and potential starting points.  I'll cover a lot, so please don't feel like you need to address everything at once.  It's about finding *one* small thing to start with.

**First, acknowledging the weight of this:**

* **Loss is cumulative trauma:** Losing jobs, possessions, freedom, and financial security are all significant losses, and they build up over time.  It's not just the individual losses, but the *combined* weight of them that's so heavy.  Don't minimize what you've been through.
* **Isolation is a huge factor:**  Not having a car and rarely going out creates a cycle of isolation.  That can worsen feelings of depression, anxiety, and hopelessness.
* **The 'invisible' work of motherhood:**  Being a stay-at-home mom *is* work – incredibly demanding work. But it's often undervalued, and it can be easy to feel like you don't have anything *to* show for your day except a clean house.  That's not true, but it's a common feeling.
* **Feeling trapped:** The constant cleaning, the lack of financial independence, and the limited freedom can feel incredibly trapping.



**Let's address potential steps, broken down into categories.  I'm going to suggest things in small steps, recognizing that big changes feel overwhelming right now.**

**1.  Your Well-being (This is the MOST important)**

* **Mental Health Check-In:**  This sounds like it's impacting your mental health significantly.  Would you be open to exploring resources for that?  Here are a few options (I'll list more at the end):
    * **Free/Low-Cost Therapy:**  Many areas have community mental health centers offering sliding scale fees.  Online therapy platforms like BetterHelp or Talkspace can sometimes be more affordable, but research them carefully.
    * **Support Groups:**  Finding a support group – even online – for stay-at-home mothers, or for people experiencing loss, can be incredibly validating and helpful.
    * **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741 if you're in immediate distress.  This is available 24/7.
    * **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text 988 in the US and Canada, or dial 111 in the UK.
* **Small Self-Care Acts:**  Even when you feel overwhelmed, can you find 5-10 minutes for *something* that feels good, even if it's just:
    * A warm bath or shower
    * Listening to music
    * Reading a chapter of a book
    * A cup of tea in silence
    * Stretching or deep breathing
* **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a healthy way to process them.  It doesn't have to be perfect; just get it out.

**2.  Regaining Some Financial Independence (Even Small Steps Matter)**

* **Skills Assessment:** What skills do you have?  Even skills you used *before* being a stay-at-home mom are valuable.  Think about:
    * What did you enjoy in previous jobs?
    * What are you good at? (cooking, organizing, writing, customer service, etc.)
    * What are you naturally curious about?
* **Remote Work Options:**  Since leaving the house is difficult right now, focus on remote work.  Some ideas:
    * **Freelance Writing/Editing:**  Platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and ProBlogger job boards.
    * **Virtual Assistant:**  Tasks like email management, scheduling, social media assistance.
    * **Customer Service:** Many companies hire remote customer service reps.
    * **Transcription:** Transcribing audio or video files.
    * **Data Entry:**  (Often lower paying, but can be a starting point.)
* **Micro-Tasks:**  Websites like Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) offer small tasks for small amounts of money.  It's not a lot, but it can be a start.
* **Selling Unused Items:**  Do you have anything you can sell online (Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, eBay)?

**3.  Breaking the Isolation & Building Freedom**

* **Start Small with Social Connection:**  This doesn't have to be big outings. Could you:

"I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I can't afford to live alone.

My mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules. She is trying to control my life. What should I do?","That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now.  The first thing to under is that you can’t change who your parents are and cannot change their behavior.  The thing to keep in mind is that you can control your responses and actions.  You may need to keep living at home with them for the next few months or years and the best way to do this is to have a plan. The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior.  Controlling parents are often driven by their concept of what will keep their children safe and happy.  Unfortunately this is not always accurate but keep in mind it is not a personal attack.  There are ways you can deal with controlling parents – and most of them require creating a plan of action.Examples of action plans:Decide in advance how you’ll calmly and rationally respond to your parents when you feel they’re trying to control youArrange to phone a friend or trusted adult when you feel like you’re losing controlTalk in person to an adult you trust. There aren’t any quick tips on how to deal with parents who want to control you; you need to find strategies that are geared to your specific family situation.  Get specific coping tips from books about family dynamics, such as:Toxic Parents: Overcoming Their Hurtful Legacy and Reclaiming Your Life by Susan ForwardCutting Loose: An Adult's Guide to Coming to Terms with Your Parents by Howard HalpernA counselor can be a good resource and provide support and guidance about issues addressing normal growth and development during periods of transition.  ","Okay, this is a *very* common situation, especially for people in their early 20s right now with the cost of living being what it is. It's tough balancing gratitude for your parents' support with the need for independence. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering everything from understanding the situation to possible actions you can take.  I'll try to be thorough.

**1. Understand the Dynamics at Play**

* **Your Mother's Perspective:**  It's important to try to see things from her side, even if you disagree.  She likely has a few core motivations:
    * **Concern for Your Well-being:** She genuinely cares about you and wants you to succeed. Her ""rules"" might stem from a belief she knows what's best.
    * **Financial Contribution:**  She *is* providing a significant benefit by letting you live there rent-free (or at a reduced cost).  She may feel entitled to have a say in how things are run.
    * **Habit/Role:**  She's been in the role of parent/caretaker for 20+ years. It's hard to shift gears.
    * **Cultural Expectations:**  In some cultures, multigenerational living comes with very specific expectations of deference and obedience. (This might or might not apply to you, but it's worth considering.)
* **Your Perspective:** You're an adult (or nearing it) and need space to grow, make your own choices, and learn from your own mistakes.  Being controlled feels stifling and can hinder your development.
* **The Imbalance of Power:**  Right now, the power dynamic is heavily in your mother's favor.  You're dependent on her for housing.  Acknowledging this is crucial.



**2. Identify *Specifically* What's Bothering You**

""Trying to control my life"" is broad.  Get specific.  Examples:

* **Curfew:** Is she imposing one?
* **Social Life:** Is she questioning your friends, dictating who you can see?
* **Dating:**  Is she interfering in your romantic relationships?
* **Career/Education:** Is she pushing you toward a certain path you don't want?
* **Finances:** Is she controlling how you spend your money (even if it's *your* money)?
* **Chores/Household Rules:**  Are the rules unreasonable or excessive? (e.g., demanding constant cleaning to a specific standard)
* **Personal Choices:**  Is she criticizing your clothing, hobbies, or beliefs?

Writing these down will help you articulate the problem and prepare for a conversation.  Rank them by how much they bother you.  Some might be easier to address than others.

**3.  Have a Calm, Respectful Conversation (This is Key!)**

* **Choose the Right Time:**  Don't bring this up when either of you are stressed, tired, or in the middle of something else.  Pick a quiet moment when you can both focus.
* **Start with Gratitude:**  ""Mom, I really appreciate you letting me live here. It's a huge help, and I'm grateful for everything you do.""
* **Use ""I"" Statements:**  Focus on how *you* feel, not on blaming her.  Instead of ""You're always trying to control me,"" try ""I feel stifled when I'm told who I can spend time with.""
* **Be Specific:**  Refer back to the list you made.  ""I understand the need for household rules, but I'd like to discuss the curfew.  I feel like it prevents me from [explain reason - e.g., taking an evening class, pursuing a work opportunity, having a normal social life].""
* **Acknowledge Her Concerns:** ""I know you're worried about me, and I appreciate that. I want to reassure you that I'm taking responsibility for my life.""
* **Propose a Compromise:**  This is *crucial*.  Don't just complain.  Offer solutions.  Examples:
    * ""I'm happy to contribute more to household chores if that would give me more freedom.""
    * ""I'll keep you updated on my plans so you know where I am, but I'd like to make my own decisions about how I spend my evenings.""
    * ""I'm willing to discuss my finances with you, but I'd like to be the one making the final decisions.""
* **Listen to Her Response:**  Don't interrupt.  Try to understand her perspective, even if you don't agree with it.
* **Be Prepared for Resistance:** She might not be receptive right away.  She might get defensive.  Stay calm"
"My ex-husband told my two adolescents that Santa doesn't exist on the day before Christmas. They are desperate to hold on to the magic of Christmas, but I don't know if it's right for me to lie to them and tell them that Santa is real. I don't want to let them down and make them lose out on those memories, but I also don't want to lose their trust.","Well Boise, the cat's out of the bag now, isn't it? I love that you want to help your kids keep the magic of Christmas. They must want that too if they still believe in Santa into their teen years, which is unusual, I believe. I wonder if they had already figured it out anyway?But they know now, and your ex had the right to tell them if he felt it was best. So it's time to explain to them what a loving and magical thing it is that parents do, and Christmas can still be magical in so many ways. Really, who says they have to stop believing in Santa? Santa is very real as a spirit of surprise, generosity and love. ","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and your ex-husband's timing was...less than ideal, to put it mildly. You're right to feel conflicted. You're balancing wanting to preserve a cherished childhood experience with the very important goal of maintaining your children's trust. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, with several options, and things to consider, categorized for clarity.  I'll also try to address the trust issue head-on.

**1. Understanding the Damage & Your Kids' Needs**

* **Your Ex's Action:** What he did was unkind and disrespectful to both your kids and *you* as a co-parent. It took away their agency to discover this on their own terms, and it put you in a horrible position.  Acknowledging that *to yourself* is important.  It doesn't change the situation, but it helps you navigate it with clarity.
* **Adolescent Development:** The age of your adolescents is key. ""Adolescent"" covers a broad range. A 13-year-old will process this *very* differently than a 15-year-old. The younger end of that spectrum is still very likely to want to believe, even if they're starting to question.  The older end is likely grappling with more complex ideas about the world and truth.
* **Their Reaction:** You say they're ""desperate to hold on to the magic."" That's incredibly valuable information.  It tells you they genuinely *want* to believe.  What specifically are they saying? Are they angry with their dad? Are they asking *you* to confirm or deny? Are they trying to find evidence to prove Santa is real? Their specific expressions of distress will guide your response.
* **The Importance of the ""Why"":**  Why is the magic of Christmas important to them?  Is it the gifts? Is it the family tradition? Is it the *feeling* of wonder and joy? Understanding the core need will help you address it, even if Santa isn't the vehicle.



**2. Addressing the Trust Issue - The Core Concern**

This is the most important part. You're right to worry about losing trust.  Here's how to mitigate that:

* **Don't Directly Lie:**  A flat-out ""Santa IS real!"" will feel dishonest, and they'll likely know it. That *will* damage trust. It's far better to be nuanced.
* **Acknowledge the Confusion & Hurt:** Start by validating their feelings.  Something like: ""I know your dad told you something really big yesterday, and it's okay to feel upset, confused, or sad. It's a big change, and it's not how most people find out about Santa.""  (This subtly acknowledges your ex's poor handling of things without badmouthing him directly).
* **The ""Spirit of Santa"" Conversation:** This is where you can walk the line beautifully.  You can say something like:
    *  ""What your dad said is true that *one man* can't deliver presents to all the children in the world. But the *spirit* of Santa – the kindness, the generosity, the joy of giving – that's very real. That spirit lives in people who do thoughtful things for others, especially at Christmas.""
    *  ""The story of Santa Claus grew over time. It started with a real person, Saint Nicholas, who was known for his generosity. Over the years, the story became a symbol of the magic of Christmas and the joy of giving.  The magic isn’t *just* about a man in a red suit; it's about *feeling* that joy.""
* **Transparency (Age-Appropriate):**  You can gently explain that parents *participate* in the Santa magic. “A lot of parents like to keep the spirit of Santa alive by helping to create that magic for you when you were younger. It’s a way of showing love and making Christmas special.""  (Don't confess to *everything* immediately, gauge their reaction.)
* **""I'll Always Be Honest With You"":**  This is *crucial*.  Say something like, “I want you to know that I will always try to be honest with you, even when things are hard. That’s really important to me.”



**3.  Possible Responses, Tailored to Their Reaction**

Here are a few scenarios and how to respond:

* **Scenario A: They're Asking You Directly, ""Is Santa Real?""**
    * **Best Response:** ""That's a really good question. Your dad shared something with you yesterday that has you questioning things, and that's okay. I think the most important thing to understand is what Santa *represents*. The spirit of kindness and"
"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","Yes, if crying is how you are expressing an emotion, then not only would it be normal, but hopefully encouraged, because it's an important part of therapy to have a safe space to express your emotions. We might encourage you to put words to the tears as well, to help you expand on your experience and begin to make more sense of it.As a therapist, our job is help you open up and feel comfortable enough doing so. I sincerely hope no therapist would ever shame you for whatever experience you are having in the room.","Okay, it's *completely* normal to be freaking out before starting therapy, and your fear about crying and feeling embarrassed is a super common one! Honestly, you're far from alone in worrying about that. Let's break it down and hopefully ease your mind a little.

**Is it something to worry about? Absolutely not.**

Here's why:

* **Therapy *is* a safe space for emotions.**  That's literally its purpose.  It's designed to be a place where you can feel *all* the feelings, without judgment.  A good therapist *expects* people to cry. It's not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of being human and allowing yourself to feel.
* **Therapists are trained to handle tears.** They've seen it all before. They have tissues! They have techniques for helping you navigate those feelings. They won't be surprised, shocked, or think you're ""overreacting."" In fact, they'll likely see it as a positive step, showing you're allowing yourself to be vulnerable.
* **Crying is a release.**  It can be a really healthy way to process emotions.  Holding everything in is often much harder than letting it out.  
* **Embarrassment is often about perceived judgment.** Because the therapist is trained to be non-judgmental, the embarrassment is likely coming from *your own* internal critic.  They are there to support you, not judge you.
* **It's okay to acknowledge the anxiety *about* crying.** You can even *tell* your therapist you're worried about crying!  That’s a perfectly valid thing to bring up and can be part of the therapeutic process.



**Here's what might help you feel more prepared:**

* **Remind yourself why you're going to therapy.** You're doing this for *you*.  To work through things, to feel better, to grow.  That takes courage, and that's something to be proud of.
* **It's okay to say ""I need a moment.""** If you feel tears coming on and are feeling overwhelmed, it's perfectly acceptable to say, ""I need a moment to collect myself.""  Or ""I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now.""
* **You don't *have* to talk about everything at once.** You set the pace. You control what you share and when. Start with something less emotionally charged if that feels safer.
* **Consider what feels comforting to you.** Do you like having tissues handy?  Would you feel better knowing you can take deep breaths?  Bringing a water bottle can be helpful too.
* **Remember your therapist is a professional.** They are ethically bound to confidentiality and to create a safe space for you.
* **It's okay if it's awkward at first.** The first few sessions often *are* a bit awkward as you and your therapist get to know each other. That’s normal!

**What to do *if* you start to cry:**

* **Don't apologize for it.** Seriously.  It's okay.
* **Let it happen.**  Allow yourself to feel the emotion.
* **Your therapist will likely just offer a tissue and a supportive silence.**  They'll let you process.
* **If you feel like you're losing control, tell them.**  ""I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now,"" is a perfectly good thing to say.

**A thought experiment:** Imagine a friend came to *you* upset and started crying. Would you judge them? Would you think they were embarrassing themselves?  Probably not. You'd offer comfort and support.  Your therapist will do the same for you.




**Finally:**  It's really great that you're recognizing this fear *now*. It means you're aware of your feelings, and that’s a good sign!  Taking that first step to go to therapy is a huge accomplishment.  



If you're still feeling really anxious, maybe write down a few of your fears and bring them with you to your first session. You can even share this worry with your therapist directly. They will likely be happy you brought it up.

You've got this!  It's brave to seek help, and you deserve to feel supported.



Is there anything else specifically about this situation that's making you anxious?  Maybe talking it through a bit more could help."

You're facing a significant crisis, and the path forward will require honesty, courage, and a lot of self-reflection. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, divided into sections.  It's long, but this is a complex issue, and deserves a thorough response.  I'll also include a *very important disclaimer* at the end.

**1. Understanding the Core Issues**

Before you do *anything* else, you need to understand *why* this is happening. ""It just happened"" is rarely the full story. Here are some questions to ask yourself – and be brutally honest with your answers.  This is for *you*, not for anyone else right now.  Consider writing these down:

*   **What needs are being met by these encounters that aren't being met in your relationship?**  This isn't about blaming your partner.  It's about identifying gaps.  Is it emotional intimacy, sexual variety, a sense of excitement, validation, something else? Be specific.
*   **When did this start, and what was going on in your life and in your relationship at that time?**  Look for triggers or underlying issues.  Stress, unhappiness, changes in the relationship, personal insecurities... these can all contribute.
*   **What are your feelings about your fiancée?**  Do you love her?  Are you excited about marrying her?  If you're having doubts about the relationship itself, this needs to be addressed *separately* from the infidelity.
*   **What are your beliefs about monogamy and relationships?**  Have these beliefs changed over time?  Are you fundamentally uncomfortable with the idea of a lifelong monogamous commitment?  (This doesn't *justify* the behavior, but it helps understand the root.)
*   **What are your fears?** Fear of commitment? Fear of vulnerability? Fear of losing yourself in the relationship?
*   **What is the pattern?** Is it tied to specific situations, times of stress, alcohol use, or anything else?



**2. The Immediate Choices: Honesty vs. Deception**

You have two fundamental paths, and both are incredibly difficult.

*   **Option A: Honesty (Before the Wedding)** This is the harder path *immediately*, but potentially the most ethical and the one with the greatest chance of long-term healing, *if* your fiancée is willing to work through it.  It involves:
    *   **Confessing everything to your fiancée.** This means a full, honest disclosure of what has happened, how often, and the reasons (as you understand them).  Do *not* minimize or omit details.
    *   **Accepting the consequences.**  She may choose to end the relationship.  She may be deeply hurt, angry, and need time to process. You must be prepared for this.  You cannot control her reaction.
    *   **Committing to therapy (individual and couples).**  This is *essential*, regardless of whether she stays.  You need to understand your behavior and address the underlying issues.  Couples therapy can help rebuild trust (if possible).
    *   **Stopping all contact with the other men immediately.**  Continued contact is a betrayal and will sabotage any chance of reconciliation.
*   **Option B: Deception (Continuing to the Wedding)** This path involves continuing to hide the truth.  It is deeply unethical and will likely lead to even more pain and damage in the long run.  It means:
    *   **Continuing the secrecy and lies.**  This will create immense emotional strain on *you*.
    *   **Entering marriage based on a foundation of deceit.** This fundamentally compromises the relationship.
    *   **Risk of discovery.** The truth often comes out, sometimes years later, and the consequences are usually far worse than if you had been honest initially.  The betrayal is compounded by the years of lying.
    *   **Perpetuating harmful behavior.**  If you don't address the underlying issues, the behavior is likely to continue.

**I strongly advise against Option B.**  While it might seem easier in the short term, it's a recipe for disaster.  You deserve a relationship built on honesty, and your fiancée deserves the same.



**3.  If You Choose Honesty:  How to Have the Conversation**

This will be one of the most difficult conversations of your life. Here's some guidance:

*   **Choose the right time and place:**  A private, quiet setting where you won't be interrupted.  Avoid doing it before a special event or when she's already stressed.
*   **Take full responsibility:**  Don't blame her, your upbringing, or"
"I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out.    How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it. I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy. What should I do?","Keep doing the crossdressing since you like it.Your problem sounds more a matter of timing and reason to tell the girl about it.Not keeping a secret is a good attitude regarding meaningful parts of your life.  Usually our relationship partner is someone whom we trust as a safe person to know all about us.Once you feel at ease with your potential partner then bring up your crossdressing.  Based on their handling of this intimate part of your life, you will know more as to whether or not you feel more or less drawn to them.Secrets held within a relationship usually get worse with time.   The person who feels unsafe in truly being and stating themselves eventually will end up feeling ashamed of parts of them which prior to the relationship, felt good or at least not worrisome.","Okay, this is a really complex and vulnerable situation, and it's good you're thinking through it carefully. It's completely valid to want to explore your gender expression *and* be attracted to women. It's also understandable that you're encountering challenges in dating. Let's break down the different parts of your question and explore some approaches.  This is a long response, because it's a nuanced topic, but I'll try to be thorough.

**1. Should you stop crossdressing if it bothers potential partners?**

Absolutely not, *unless you genuinely want to*. Your happiness and self-expression are paramount.  You deserve to live authentically.  The fact that someone else is uncomfortable with a core part of who you are isn't a reason to change yourself.  It *is* a reason to potentially reconsider if they're the right partner for *you*. 

However, it's important to be realistic.  Some people have very fixed ideas about gender and relationships.  Trying to force a connection with someone who is fundamentally incompatible with your self-expression is likely to lead to unhappiness for both of you.

**2. To Disclose or Not to Disclose?  And When?**

This is the biggest question.  There's no single right answer, but here's a breakdown of the pros and cons of each approach, and a suggested timeline:

*   **Keeping it a Secret (Initially):**
    *   **Pros:**  May allow you to get to know someone *before* potential judgments come into play.  Can avoid immediate rejection based on misunderstanding.  You have control over the timing of the reveal.
    *   **Cons:**  Creates a sense of inauthenticity and can be stressful to maintain.  The longer you wait, the harder it can be to disclose.  If discovered later, it can feel like a betrayal of trust, which can be far more damaging than disclosing upfront. It can also prevent a real, deep connection from forming, because you're not showing your full self.
*   **Being Upfront:**
    *   **Pros:**  Authenticity from the start.  Attracts people who are genuinely accepting and open-minded.  Builds trust and allows for a deeper connection based on honesty.  Saves you (and them) time if it's a dealbreaker for them.
    *   **Cons:**  May lead to quicker rejection.  Requires vulnerability and can be scary.  You might face questions or misunderstandings.

**My Recommendation:  Gradual Transparency**

I strongly suggest a middle ground: **gradual transparency.** Don't lead with it on a dating profile or first message. But don't actively *hide* it either. Focus on getting to know someone as a person first.  Then, when you feel a connection forming, and you feel safe and comfortable, start to introduce aspects of yourself.

Here's a possible timeline:

*   **Early Stages (First Few Dates):** Focus on shared interests, values, and getting to know her as a person.  Dress in a way that feels comfortable and authentic *to you*, but might not be your fullest expression if you're very concerned about immediate reactions. Think of it as 'you, but dialed down a little' to ease the introduction.
*   **Building Connection (After a Few Dates, When You Feel Safe):**  This is when you can start subtly hinting. Maybe mention enjoying fashion, exploring different styles, or appreciating artistry and self-expression.  Gauge her reactions.  Is she curious? Open-minded? Dismissive?
*   **Disclosure (When the Time Feels Right):**  This is a more direct conversation.  Choose a private, comfortable setting.  Be prepared to explain, but don’t over-explain or apologize.

**3. How to Approach the Conversation:**

*   **Lead with Your Feelings:**  ""I'm really enjoying getting to know you, and I want to be honest about who I am.""
*   **Explain Your Crossdressing as Self-Expression:**  ""I'm someone who enjoys expressing myself through clothing and exploring a feminine presentation. It's a part of who I am, and it makes me feel good.""  (Avoid framing it as a 'problem' or something you're 'trying to overcome').
*   **Emphasize Your Attraction to Women:**  ""I want to be clear that this doesn't change the fact that I'm attracted to women. I'm attracted to *you*.""
*   **Be Prepared to Answer Questions:**  She will likely have questions. Answer them honestly and patiently.  She may not understand, and that’s okay.
*   **Set Boundaries:** You are not obligated to answer invasive or disrespectful questions. You can say, ""I'm happy"
I need help knowing how to deal with stress. What can I do?,"Our body reacts to stress typically by breathing more shallowly, increasing our heart rate and tensing our muscles - so one thing that I find really effective is to try to do the opposite of that, which sends the signal to our mind that we are relaxed. So that means, taking slower, fuller breaths and trying to relax any areas where we might be gripping our muscles. Check out meditation apps such as 'Breathe', which can talk you through a relaxing breath exercise. I recommend using the app daily, whether you feel stressed or not, and then also using it when you re feeling particular moments of stress - that way you are practicing the skill when you feel calm(wish) and it'll be ready and able to help you when stress hits hard.","Okay, dealing with stress is a really important skill, and it's great that you're asking for help! It's something *everyone* struggles with at some point. Here's a breakdown of things you can do, broken down into categories, from quick fixes to longer-term strategies.  I'll also try to give a variety because what works for one person doesn't always work for another.  I'll end with some resources.

**First: Understanding Your Stress**

Before diving into solutions, it's helpful to understand *your* stress.

*   **Identify Your Triggers:** What situations, people, or thoughts consistently cause you stress?  Keeping a stress journal for a week can be eye-opening.  Write down:
    *   What happened?
    *   How did you feel (emotionally *and* physically)?
    *   How did you react?
*   **Recognize Your Symptoms:**  Stress manifests differently for everyone. Common symptoms include:
    *   **Emotional:**  Irritability, anxiety, sadness, feeling overwhelmed, mood swings
    *   **Physical:**  Headaches, muscle tension, fatigue, digestive problems, changes in appetite or sleep
    *   **Behavioral:**  Procrastination, isolating yourself, snapping at others, difficulty concentrating, increased use of substances (alcohol, caffeine, etc.)
*   **Assess Your Coping Mechanisms (Current):** What do you *already* do when you're stressed?  Are these helpful (healthy coping) or unhelpful (avoidance, unhealthy habits)?



**I. Immediate/Short-Term Stress Relief (In the Moment)**

These are things you can do *right now* when you're feeling overwhelmed.

*   **Deep Breathing:**  This is incredibly effective.  Try:
    *   **Diaphragmatic Breathing (Belly Breathing):**  Place one hand on your chest and the other on your stomach.  Breathe in deeply through your nose, allowing your stomach to rise (your chest should move very little).  Exhale slowly through your mouth. Repeat 5-10 times.
    *   **4-7-8 Breathing:** Inhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds.
*   **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:**  Tense and then relax different muscle groups, starting with your toes and working your way up to your head.  (There are guided audio recordings available - see Resources below)
*   **Grounding Techniques:**  These help bring you back to the present moment.
    *   **5-4-3-2-1 Method:**  Name 5 things you can *see*, 4 things you can *touch*, 3 things you can *hear*, 2 things you can *smell*, and 1 thing you can *taste*.
    *   **Focus on Physical Sensations:**  Feel your feet on the ground, the chair supporting you, the temperature of the air.
*   **Take a Break:**  Step away from the stressful situation, even for 5-10 minutes.
*   **Listen to Music:**  Calming music can have a powerful effect.
*   **Quick Mindfulness Exercise:**  Pay attention to your senses – what do you see, hear, smell, taste, feel?  Just observe without judgment.
*   **Drink Water:**  Dehydration can worsen stress.
*   **Gentle Stretching:**  Releases physical tension.



**II. Medium-Term Strategies (Daily/Weekly Habits)**

These require more consistent effort but build resilience over time.

*   **Regular Exercise:**  Physical activity is a fantastic stress reliever. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.  Find something you *enjoy* – walking, running, swimming, dancing, yoga, etc.
*   **Healthy Diet:**  Nourish your body with a balanced diet. Limit processed foods, sugar, and caffeine.
*   **Prioritize Sleep:**  Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.  Establish a regular sleep schedule.
*   **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  Regular meditation can train your brain to be more present and less reactive to stress.  Even 5-10 minutes a day can make a difference. Apps like Headspace, Calm, and Insight Timer can help.
*   **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them.
*   **Spend Time in Nature:**  Being outdoors has been shown to reduce stress hormones.
*   **Social Connection:**  Spend time with people you care about.  Social support is crucial.
*   **Hobbies & Activities:**  Make time for things you enjoy.  These provide a sense of pleasure and accomplishment."
They're calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as I do. I'm tired of being called names. What should I do?,"It sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner, correct? Communication is key to any relationship. I would recommend speaking with your friends face-to-face to address why they feel your behavior is concerning. In-person contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts, emails or any written response can be misconstrued. Be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded. If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling, maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly. Especially if this friendship is valuable to you. However, make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them. On the other hand, if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded, it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship. Not all friendships are healthy ones. And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it.I hope you are able to get this matter sorted. Best of luck!","Okay, this is really tough, and it's completely understandable why you're tired of being called names, *especially* when they're doing the same thing! It's incredibly frustrating to be on the receiving end of criticism that isn't justified. Here's a breakdown of how to handle this, covering different approaches, from immediate reactions to long-term strategies.  I'll categorize it for clarity.

**1. In the Moment - Immediate Responses (Choose what feels comfortable for *you*):**

* **The ""Broken Record"" Technique:**  This is great for persistent name-calling.  Calmly and repeatedly say something like: ""I don't appreciate being called names,"" or ""Please don't speak to me like that.""  Don't get drawn into arguing *about* the name-calling, just keep repeating your boundary.  It can be surprisingly effective.
* **Point Out the Hypocrisy (Carefully):** This can be risky, and depends on the person.  If you think they *might* be receptive, you could say something like: ""That's interesting you'd say that, considering you [describe their similar action]. It feels a bit hypocritical.""  Deliver it calmly, not accusatorily.  Be prepared for them to deflect.  (See section 3 about when *not* to do this).
* **Directly Address the Name-Calling:** ""Calling me a 'baby' isn't helpful or respectful. I'm trying to have a conversation."" or ""I don't like being called a hypocrite.  Let's focus on the issue, not personal attacks.""
* **Grey Rock Method:** This is about becoming deliberately uninteresting.  Give very short, neutral answers. Don't react emotionally.  Example:
    * **Them:** ""You're such a baby!""
    * **You:** ""Okay.""  (and then change the subject, or just… silence).
    This works best with people who are trying to provoke a reaction.
* **Walk Away:**  If you feel yourself getting heated, or if they're not responding to your attempts to set boundaries, simply remove yourself from the situation.  ""I'm not going to continue this conversation when I'm being insulted.""  Then, *leave*.  This is a powerful statement.
* **Ignore It (Sometimes):**  For minor, infrequent occurrences, sometimes the best response is *no* response.  Especially if they seem to be fishing for a reaction.  (This is harder than it sounds, but practice helps).



**2. Understanding *Why* They're Doing This:**

It's helpful to consider the motivations behind the name-calling, though it doesn't excuse the behavior.  Here are some possibilities:

* **Projection:** They may be feeling insecure about their own actions and are projecting their guilt onto you.  Calling you a hypocrite might make them feel less bad about their own inconsistencies.
* **Control:** Name-calling is a form of power and control. They might be trying to dominate the conversation or put you down.
* **Lack of Emotional Maturity:** They might not have the skills to express their feelings or disagreements in a healthy way.
* **Learned Behavior:** They may have grown up in an environment where name-calling was common.
* **They're Trying to Provoke You:** Some people thrive on getting a rise out of others.
* **Miscommunication/Perceived Wrongdoing:**  Even if you don't think you've done anything wrong, they might perceive it differently.  (This doesn't justify the name-calling, but it can help you understand where it's coming from).

**3.  When *Not* to Engage (Important!)**

* **If they are escalating:** If the name-calling is becoming increasingly aggressive, or if you feel threatened, *do not* try to reason with them.  Your safety is the priority.  Remove yourself from the situation and, if necessary, seek help from a trusted adult or authority figure.
* **If they are consistently unwilling to listen:**  If you've tried calmly explaining your perspective and they consistently dismiss you or continue the attacks, arguing will likely be fruitless.
* **If you are emotionally overwhelmed:**  If you're already feeling upset or anxious, trying to have a rational discussion will be difficult.  Take some time to calm down before addressing the issue.
* **Don't get drawn into ""tit-for-tat"":**  Responding with name-calling of your own will only escalate the conflict and make you look just as bad.

**4. Long-Term Strategies:**

* **Strengthen Your Boundaries:**  This is crucial.  Clearly define what behavior you will and will not tolerate.  Practice asserting your boundaries"
"I empathize so much, even with characters on tv or in video games, that I actually feel physical pain. This has made life difficult to say the least.

I believe I have an actually case of something called hyper empathy disorder. But since it's such a new disorder I can't find any information about it. Could this be what is going on with me?","The world needs more people lately who have such a high degree of empathy which you describe in yourself!If it feels a little burdensome, then look to balance what is too much with its opposite.  Since you're giving a lot of empathy, maybe you'd like receiving a lot of empathy.In the situation you describe, when you start empathizing with others, real or cartoon, ask yourself whether you've felt empathy coming in your direction lately.Often people give to others what they feel within themselves is missing.The emotional brain reasons that if I give you my support, say, then at least I will feel half of what being supported is like.Obviously the wish to receive more empathy cannot be fulfilled by you directly.  Empathy is delivered by someone who is willing to offer it.Reflect on whether you are allowing those who are in your world, to know when you would like to receive their empathy.Is it possible you keep your feelings to yourself and present as though you are able to handle a great deal more than you'd like to handle without anyone's kindness to support you?Being open to others about your own inner thoughts and feelings is much more difficult than it sounds.It sounds easy to just tell someone how you feel.Sometimes the first step is the most difficult, of accessing how you feel.Start with knowing the amount of empathy you'd like from others and what stops you from asking.Also, about your diagnosis and the lack of  studies and lists and formulas.  Each person is unique, the instructions and guidelines don't necessarily mean very much.  Often having a diagnosis makes a person feel weak, stigmatized, incompetent. Forget the diagnosis and concentrate on what you need to do differently in order to feel better.The answers are inside you, not inside a book or website.","Okay, this sounds incredibly challenging and I'm really glad you're reaching out. It's valid to feel distressed when experiencing such intense emotional and *physical* reactions to the experiences of others, even fictional ones.  Let's break down what you're describing, the idea of ""Hyper Empathy Disorder,"" and what steps you can take.

**First: Validating Your Experience**

It's important to start by saying your experience is real and deserves attention.  Feeling physical pain in response to others' suffering (or even joy, sometimes) is *not* typical empathy.  Typical empathy is understanding and sharing the feelings of another; what you're describing is a much more profound and physically manifesting connection.  The fact that it's making life difficult confirms it's impacting your well-being and needs to be addressed.  Don't dismiss it or feel like you're ""crazy"" for experiencing this.



**About ""Hyper Empathy Disorder"" (HED)**

You're right to point out it's a relatively new concept.  Here's a breakdown of what's known:

* **Not Officially Recognized (Yet):** HED is *not* currently a formally recognized diagnosis in the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) or the ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases).  This means it’s not universally accepted by the medical community *as a distinct, separate disorder*. This is a crucial point.  
* **Emerging Research:**  However, a growing number of clinicians (especially those specializing in highly sensitive people and neurodiversity) *are* using the term to describe a cluster of traits and experiences.  Dr. Michele Neff, a psychologist, is a leading figure in researching and discussing HED. Her work is a good starting point for understanding it.  (I'll link resources at the end).
* **Key Characteristics (as currently understood):** HED is characterized by:
    * **Extreme Emotional Contagion:**  You don't just understand another person’s emotions; you *feel* them as if they are your own, and to a far greater degree than most people.
    * **Physical Symptoms:** This is a *defining* feature of HED. Experiencing physical symptoms like pain, nausea, fatigue, headaches, changes in heart rate, or even mimicking the physical sensations of others is common.  This is where it goes beyond typical empathy.
    * **Difficulty with Boundaries:**  Struggling to differentiate your own emotions from those of others, leading to overwhelm and difficulty protecting your own emotional space.
    * **Overstimulation:**  Being easily overwhelmed by social situations, crowded places, or even emotionally charged media.
    * **Tendency to Take On Others' Pain:**  Feeling compelled to fix other people's problems, sometimes to your own detriment.
    * **Sensitivity to Subtle Cues:**  Being highly attuned to nonverbal communication, energy, and emotional undercurrents.
* **Potential Overlap with Other Conditions:**  Because HED isn’t officially defined, the symptoms often overlap with or can co-occur with other conditions. This is why a thorough assessment is crucial (see below).  Possible overlaps include:
    * **Highly Sensitive Person (HSP):**  HSP is a trait, not a disorder.  Many with HED are also HSPs, but not all HSPs have HED. HSPs are highly sensitive to stimuli, but don’t necessarily experience the *physical* mirroring to the same degree.
    * **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):**  Some individuals on the autism spectrum experience intense empathy, though it often presents differently.
    * **Complex PTSD (C-PTSD):** Trauma can heighten emotional reactivity and sensitivity.
    * **Anxiety Disorders:**  Anxiety can exacerbate emotional and physical responses.
    * **Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD):**  Emotional dysregulation and sensitivity to others' emotions can be features. *It is important to note that suggesting this is just a possibility, and self-diagnosis is never advised*.



**What To Do Next:  Seeking Help & Understanding**

1. **Consult a Mental Health Professional:**  This is the *most important* step.  You need a qualified therapist or psychologist.  Specifically, look for someone with experience in:
    * **Trauma-informed care:**  Even if you don't identify as having trauma, this approach is helpful for understanding sensitivity.
    * **High Sensitivity:**  Someone familiar with the work of Elaine Aron (HSP research).
    * **Neurodiversity:**  Someone who is open to exploring possibilities beyond traditional diagnoses.
    * **Emotional Regulation:** Skills to manage overwhelming emotions.
    * **They should be willing to listen to your experience without immediately dismissing it.**  It's okay to ""shop around"
"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","It is normal to feel an array of emotions in therapy. Most people use therapy as a way to process their life's struggles and often times this results in them crying during session. Crying is a way to release those negative emotions and to cope with what is happening in life. We have come to believe that crying is something bad at times and so have conditioned ourselves to avoid crying out in public places. In therapy though, where there are no such expectations and where you can be open and honest about how you are feeling it is normal to cry.","It is **absolutely normal** to cry during therapy! In fact, it's incredibly common. You are *definitely* not alone. Here's a breakdown of why it happens and what it means, and why it's often a *good* thing:

**Why people cry in therapy:**

* **Safe Space:** Therapy is designed to be a safe, non-judgmental space. This allows you to let down your guard and feel emotions you might normally suppress in everyday life.
* **Processing Difficult Emotions:** You're often talking about painful experiences, traumas, or challenging feelings.  Crying is a natural emotional release valve.
* **Vulnerability:**  Sharing deeply personal things takes courage and makes you vulnerable. That vulnerability itself can bring tears.
* **Relief:**  Sometimes crying is a relief. It's a physical manifestation of releasing pent-up emotions.
* **Realization & Insight:**  A moment of clarity or a new understanding about yourself or a situation can be very emotional.
* **Connection with the Therapist:**  A strong therapeutic relationship can foster a sense of trust and safety, making it easier to cry.  You might feel comfortable enough to express yourself fully.
* **Simply Being Heard:** Sometimes just *being truly heard* and validated can be enough to trigger tears.
* **Accumulated Emotions:** You might be holding onto a lot of emotions for a long time, and therapy can be the place where they finally surface.

**Is it a sign of weakness?**

Absolutely not! It's a sign of **strength** to allow yourself to feel and express emotions.  Suppressing emotions can be far more damaging in the long run.



**What if you're worried about crying?**

* **It's okay to acknowledge it:** You can say to your therapist, ""I feel like I might cry,"" or ""I'm starting to feel overwhelmed.""  They're trained to handle this.
* **Your therapist won't judge you:** A good therapist will offer you space and support, not judgment. They might offer a tissue, a moment to collect yourself, or help you explore *why* you're crying.
* **Don't feel pressured:** You don't *have* to cry.  If you're not feeling it, that's okay too.
* **Talk to your therapist about it:** If you're feeling anxious about crying in sessions, bring it up!  They can help you understand your feelings and create a more comfortable environment.




**In short, crying in therapy is a very normal and often productive part of the process. Don't be embarrassed or feel like something is wrong with you. It means you're engaging with your emotions and doing the work.**



If you're still concerned, it might be helpful to ask your therapist directly. They can offer reassurance and a perspective tailored to your specific situation."
"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","When talking about difficult issues, it is very normal to cry. Crying is a natural way for us to cope with the sadness that we experience in life. When confronting some of these things in a counseling session, tears just seem to come naturally. Every Counselor should be well equipped to handle that level of emotion, and you would be far from the first to cry when talking with a Counselor.","Okay, it's *completely* normal to be freaking out a little (or a lot!) before starting therapy, and it's *especially* normal to be worried about crying. Honestly, you are SO not alone in this fear. Let's break it down and hopefully ease your mind.

**Is crying in therapy something to worry about? Absolutely not. In fact, it's a really good sign.**

Here's why:

* **It means you're allowing yourself to feel.**  A lot of us spend a lot of time *not* feeling, or suppressing feelings. Therapy is a space to gently explore those things, and that often *releases* emotion. Crying is a natural, healthy emotional release.
* **It's a signal to your therapist.**  When you cry, it tells your therapist what's important, what's painful, and where to focus.  They are trained to work *with* those emotions, not to judge them. They'll likely see it as progress.
* **Therapists are *prepared* for tears.** Seriously. They have tissues, they've seen it all before, and they understand that crying is a part of the process. It doesn't throw them off.  They won't think you're ""weak"" or ""dramatic.""  Their job is to hold space for whatever comes up.
* **It doesn't mean you're ""bad"" at therapy.** Some people cry a lot, some people barely cry at all.  There's no right or wrong way to do it.  Your emotional experience is unique to you.
* **It can be *relieving*.**  Sometimes, just letting those emotions flow can feel incredibly freeing.



**Why you might be afraid, and how to think about that:**

* **Fear of vulnerability:**  It's scary to show vulnerability to someone new.  You're worried about being judged, or appearing weak. That's totally understandable. Remember that therapists are ethically bound to confidentiality and are trained to be non-judgmental.
* **Fear of losing control:**  You might worry you'll start crying and then won't be able to stop, or that you'll become an uncontrollable mess.  While emotions *can* feel overwhelming, your therapist will help you regulate them. They have techniques to help you ground yourself if you feel overwhelmed.
* **Past experiences:** Maybe you were told as a child not to cry, or you had a negative experience where you were shamed for showing emotion. This can make it harder to allow yourself to feel now. Therapy can help you unpack those past experiences, too.
* **Perfectionism:**  You might be putting pressure on yourself to be ""strong"" or to present a certain image.  Let go of that!  Therapy is a safe space to be authentically *you*, flaws and all.

**What can you do to prepare (if you want to)?**

* **Acknowledge your fear:**  You've already done this! Just recognizing that you're anxious about crying is a good first step.
* **Remind yourself of the therapist's role:** They are there to support you, not judge you.
* **It's okay to say ""I need a moment.""** If you feel tears coming on and you're feeling overwhelmed, you can simply say, ""I'm feeling a lot right now, I just need a moment to collect myself.""
* **Bring tissues:**  Just in case!  (And most therapists will have them handy anyway).
* **Consider telling your therapist beforehand:**  You could even say, ""I'm a little nervous about starting therapy, and one of my fears is that I'll cry and feel embarrassed.""  They will likely reassure you and let you know it's perfectly okay.
* **Practice self-compassion:** Be kind to yourself. You're doing a brave thing by starting therapy.



**What if you DO cry?**

* **It's okay.**  Seriously.
* **Your therapist will likely just offer you a tissue and a supportive look.**
* **They might ask you what you're feeling, or just sit with you in silence.**
* **They will *not* think less of you.**
* **You can take breaks if you need them.**



**Bottom line:**  Crying in therapy is a normal, healthy, and even *helpful* part of the process.  Don't let the fear of it prevent you from getting the support you deserve.  

You're taking a really important step for yourself, and I wish you all the best with your first session.  It's okay to be nervous, and it's okay to cry.  You've got this.

"I have a lot on my mind, but all I want to do is stay locked in my room and not socialize with anyone. Why do I feel so alone?","There are many possible issues to consider as depression  social anxieties, even medical illness.  For some, even grief creates a sense of isolation, pains from relationship break up.  Also, obsessive thinking can be debilitating.  Seeking at least one trusted friend or family member can be a start towards increased personal support.  Some persons may simply feel connected by spending time with someone as this, even if not talking directly on issues, just being around another is positive.  Obviously there is more to explore on this question, given minimal information from two sentences.","Okay, it's really good you're recognizing this pattern and asking why you feel this way. It's completely understandable to want to withdraw when you have a lot on your mind, and it's *very* common to feel lonely even *while* withdrawing. It seems counterintuitive, right? Here's a breakdown of why you might be feeling this way, covering a lot of potential angles, and then some ideas for gently approaching things.  This is a long response because it's a complex issue, and I want to be thorough.  Please read through it all, and see what resonates with you.

**Understanding the Connection Between Withdrawal and Loneliness**

* **The Core Human Need for Connection:** Humans are social creatures. We're wired for connection. Even introverts (who recharge *differently* than extroverts, not by avoiding people entirely) need some level of meaningful interaction.  When that need isn't met, loneliness creeps in.
* **Withdrawal as a Symptom, Not a Solution:**  While hiding away *feels* safe in the moment, it often reinforces the feelings of isolation that are contributing to your distress. It's like a temporary bandage on a deeper wound.
* **The Cycle of Isolation:**  The more you withdraw, the harder it can become to re-engage.  You might start to feel awkward, rusty in your social skills, or worried about what others will think. This fear of negative judgment can then perpetuate the cycle.
* **""Alone"" vs. ""Lonely"":**  You can be *alone* and not *lonely*.  Solitude can be restorative.  But *loneliness* is the distressing feeling of being disconnected from others, of lacking the intimacy, companionship, and support you need.  You're experiencing the latter.
* **What's ""On Your Mind?""** The things you're thinking about are likely a big part of this. Are they stressful? Anxious? Sad? Shameful?  Those feelings can make you *want* to isolate, but they also contribute to the loneliness.



**Possible Reasons *Why* You're Feeling So Alone Right Now**

Let's break down potential causes.  These aren't mutually exclusive, and it's likely a combination of factors:

* **Overwhelm & Mental Health:**
    * **Stress & Anxiety:** When you're stressed or anxious, social interaction can feel *exhausting*.  You might feel like you don't have the energy to cope with the complexities of being around others.
    * **Depression:**  A hallmark of depression is often withdrawal and a loss of interest in things you once enjoyed, including socializing.  It can feel incredibly difficult to motivate yourself to reach out.
    * **Rumination:** If you're stuck in cycles of negative thought (rumination), it's easy to get lost in your head and distance yourself from the outside world.
    * **Burnout:** If you've been pushing yourself too hard, you might be experiencing burnout, leading to emotional and physical exhaustion, and a desire to escape.
* **Social Factors:**
    * **Changes in Social Circle:** Have you recently moved, changed jobs, or experienced a shift in your friendships?  Loss of familiar connections can be incredibly isolating.
    * **Feeling Misunderstood:** Do you feel like the people in your life *really* understand you?  If you don't feel seen or heard, it can lead to feelings of loneliness, even when you're around others.
    * **Social Anxiety:**  Fear of social judgment, embarrassment, or rejection can make you avoid social situations, leading to loneliness.
    * **Difficulty Forming Connections:**  Some people struggle with initiating and maintaining relationships. This could be due to a variety of factors, including personality, past experiences, or lack of social skills.
* **Past Experiences:**
    * **Trauma:** Past trauma can make it difficult to trust others and feel safe in relationships. Withdrawal can be a coping mechanism.
    * **Attachment Style:** Your early childhood experiences can influence your attachment style (how you form bonds with others).  Insecure attachment styles can lead to difficulties with intimacy and connection.
* **Lifestyle:**
    * **Increased Screen Time:**  While technology can connect us, excessive screen time can also contribute to feelings of isolation.  It can replace real-life interactions.
    * **Lack of Routine:** A lack of structure and routine can make it harder to prioritize social connection.




**What Can You Do? (Gentle Steps)**

Okay, this is the important part. Don't try to fix everything at once. Start small.  Be kind to yourself.

1. **Acknowledge and Validate Your Feelings:**  Don't beat yourself up for wanting to withdraw. It's okay to need space.  But also acknowledge"
My mother is combative with me when I say I don't want to talk with her about my depression.    She hasn't been supportive of me in the past and she isn't someone that I feel comfortable opening up to. She constantly tries to instigate conversations where she asks me questions that I don't want to or can't answer. I tell her I don't want to talk and she starts arguments with me.    How can I get her to understand?,"Your situation sounds extremely frustrating.You're doing the right move to state you don't want to discuss your depression with her.I guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression.  If you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation, and you would like to tell her your true reason, then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time, not in the middle of an argument.Having an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept.  You may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and you're right to protect your emotional space. It's incredibly frustrating when someone you love, especially a parent, doesn't respect your boundaries, *especially* when it comes to something as sensitive as depression. It's also common for parents who haven't been consistently supportive to struggle with knowing how to *be* supportive when you *do* need something different. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering understanding why she's doing this, strategies to use, and how to manage your own well-being.  This will be long, but thorough.

**1. Understanding Her Behavior (Without Excusing It)**

It's helpful to try to understand *why* she might be pushing so hard, even if it doesn't make it right. This isn't about letting her off the hook, but about potentially predicting her reactions and tailoring your responses.  Here are some possibilities:

*   **She Doesn't Understand Depression:**  She may genuinely believe she's ""helping"" by trying to fix it, or she might have a very outdated or inaccurate understanding of what depression *is*. She might think you just need to ""snap out of it"" or that talking it through with her will magically make it better.
*   **Her Own Unprocessed Emotions:** Sometimes, when someone pushes too hard, it's about *their* discomfort.  She might be anxious about your well-being, and her anxiety manifests as intrusive questioning.  Or, she might have her own history of emotional struggles she hasn't dealt with.  (This doesn't excuse her behavior, but it can offer insight.)
*   **Control & Relationship Dynamics:**  Unfortunately, sometimes parents try to maintain control through knowing everything about their children's lives.  Your desire for privacy might feel like a rejection to her.  This is especially true if your relationship has historically been imbalanced.
*   **Guilt/Feeling Helpless:** She might feel guilty about past lack of support and be trying to overcompensate now, but doing it in a clumsy and unhelpful way.
*   **Cultural Factors:** In some cultures, openly discussing mental health is taboo, or family members are expected to handle everything internally. This could be influencing her approach.



**2. Strategies for Setting and Enforcing Boundaries**

This is the core of the issue.  You need to consistently and firmly establish that you are not going to engage in these conversations. Here's how:

*   **The Broken Record Technique:** This is *highly* effective.  Choose a short, neutral phrase and repeat it calmly and consistently, no matter what she says.  Examples:
    *   ""I'm not discussing this with you.""
    *   ""I'm not comfortable talking about my depression right now.""
    *   ""This is a private matter, and I'm not going to share it.""
    *   ""I appreciate your concern, but I'm not going to talk about this.""
    * **Important:** Don't add explanations, justifications, or apologies.  Just repeat the phrase.  Every time she tries to draw you in, bring it back to your statement.
*   **Anticipate & Prepare:** Before you interact with her, mentally rehearse what you'll say.  Think about her likely tactics and how you'll respond with your chosen phrase.
*   **The ""Information Diet"":**  Give her very limited information about your life, generally.  Don't offer openings for her to probe.  Keep conversations superficial if necessary.  (This is tough, but sometimes essential.)
*   **Brief Interactions:**  Keep phone calls and visits shorter.  The longer you're engaged, the more opportunities she has to push your boundaries.
*   **Change the Subject:** If she starts to steer the conversation toward your depression, immediately change the subject.  ""Oh, speaking of [something unrelated]..."" or ""Did you see that [news story/show/event]?""
*   **""I Need to Go"":**  Have an exit strategy.  If she continues to push, say, ""I need to go now. I have an appointment/something I need to do."" And *then* end the conversation or leave.  (Don't get drawn into arguing about why you have to leave.)
*  **Written Communication (Potentially):** If direct conversation is consistently combative, *consider* a letter or email.  This allows you to clearly state your boundaries without being interrupted.  However, be prepared that she may respond defensively.  (See section 4 about managing expectations).
*   **Grey Rock Method:** This is a more advanced technique.  You become deliberately uninteresting and unresponsive.  Answer questions with very short, factual statements.  Avoid eye contact.  Don"
I am a survivor of multiple sexual abuse/rape experiences. Triggers are having an effect on my daily life and my sexual relationship with my partner. I'm trying to learn to cope with them.,"I'm glad you're willing to keep optimistic about life improving and offering better relationships than some of the ones in which you greatly suffered.One suggestion is to develop patience with yourself and the process of regaining your willingness to trust other people.Sexual intimacy engages all of who we truly are.   Being cautious as to who and how much you allow someone into your life, is natural for anyone recovering from trauma.Allow yourself to withdraw when situations feel dangerous.   Your sense of danger is most likely on higher alert than had you not been victimized.Be attentive and cooperate with your own sense of readiness to engage in conversation, discussions and sex with your partner.Explain all this to your partner so the person can develop their own patience with your recuperation process.","Okay, this takes immense courage to acknowledge and to seek help with.  It's completely understandable that past trauma is impacting your daily life and your intimacy with your partner.  You're doing a really important thing by recognizing this and wanting to learn to cope.  Here's a breakdown of information, resources, and coping strategies, broken down into sections.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is not a substitute for professional help.**

**1. Understanding Triggers & Their Impact**

* **What are Triggers?** Triggers are reminders – sights, sounds, smells, thoughts, emotions, places, or physical sensations – that can bring back intense, unwanted memories and feelings associated with the trauma. They activate your nervous system as if the trauma is happening *right now*.  It's not a sign of weakness, but a normal reaction to a very *abnormal* experience.
* **Why they affect intimacy:**  Sexual assault is a profound violation of boundaries, trust, and safety.  Triggers during intimacy (touch, positions, smells, emotional vulnerability) can understandably lead to:
    * **Emotional flashbacks:** Feeling the emotions of the trauma as if they're happening now.
    * **Dissociation:** Feeling detached from your body, emotions, or surroundings.
    * **Anxiety & Panic:** Intense fear and physical symptoms like racing heart, sweating, or difficulty breathing.
    * **Physical tension & pain:** Muscle tightening, pelvic pain, or difficulty with arousal/orgasm.
    * **Avoidance:**  Avoiding situations, touch, or intimacy altogether.
* **It's not your fault:**  Repeat this to yourself often.  Your reactions are a normal response to trauma, not a character flaw.



**2. Coping Strategies - For During & Between Intimate Moments**

These are things to explore *with your partner*, and to practice individually.  Communication is key (see section 4).

* **Grounding Techniques (during a trigger):**  These bring you back to the present moment.
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Method:**  Name 5 things you can *see*, 4 things you can *touch*, 3 things you can *hear*, 2 things you can *smell*, and 1 thing you can *taste*.
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can regulate your nervous system.  Box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4) is helpful.
    * **Physical Sensations:**  Hold an ice cube, take a warm shower, or press your feet firmly into the ground.  (Experiment to see what works for *you*.)
    * **Self-Soothing Touch:** Gently hug yourself, rub your arms, or hold your hands.
* **Safe Words/Signals:**  Establish a clear and simple safe word or non-verbal signal (like raising a hand) that *immediately* stops all activity.  No questions asked. This is about your safety and control.
* **Pacing:**  Slow down intimacy.  Focus on non-sexual touch – cuddling, massage, holding hands – to build trust and comfort.  
* **Control & Agency:**  You are in charge of your body and your experience.  You have the right to say ""no"" at any time, for any reason.
* **Mindfulness & Body Awareness:**  Practice paying attention to your body’s sensations *without judgment*. This can help you identify triggers early and respond to them more effectively.
* **Self-Care:**  Regular self-care (exercise, healthy eating, hobbies, spending time in nature) builds resilience and reduces overall stress, making you better equipped to handle triggers.
* **Create a Safe Space:**  Ensure your intimate environment feels physically and emotionally safe.  Consider lighting, music, and comfort items.



**3.  Coping Strategies - For Daily Life (Preventative)**

* **Identify Your Triggers:**  This is a process. Keep a journal to track situations, thoughts, or sensations that lead to distress. What was happening *before* you started feeling triggered?  Patterns will emerge.
* **Trigger Management:**  Once you know your triggers, you can:
    * **Avoidance (when possible):**  Sometimes, avoiding certain situations is necessary, especially in the beginning.  (This isn't about letting triggers control you *forever*, but about self-protection).
    * **Exposure (with support):**  Gradually and *safely* exposing yourself to triggers, with the support of a therapist, can help you desensitize to them. *Do not attempt this without professional guidance.*
    * **Reframing:** Challenge negative thought patterns associated with triggers.
* **Grounding Practices (daily):**  Incorporate grounding techniques"
How does a counselor decide when to end counseling sessions or to terminate working with a client?,"To be able to identify a clear ending to a counseling relationship, we must have a clear understanding of the goals and limitations of treatment.  Usually, during the initial evaluation, I identify my client’s short term and long term therapy goals.  As therapy progress, we verify goals on a monthly to a quarterly basis, depending on the frequency of the appointments.  Once the therapy goals have been met, there is a closing session, the counseling relationship is ended, and the client can stop attending sessions.  In some cases, the client can also establish new goals and determine if I am a good fit for their therapy needs or if they need a new provider, in which case I provide multiple referrals.The counseling relationship could also end due to other factors like noncompliance= when a client is not committed to the agreed treatment process, or when the client’s or a counselor violates the counseling relationship.  Either the counselor or the client is able to end counseling.  Although, as mental health providers we need to provide a reason for terminating our therapeutic relationship and referral options, as a client no explanation is needed, a closing session is highly recommended.  ¿Cómo termina la terapia?¿Cómo un consejero decide cuando terminar las sesiones de consejería o terminar de trabajar con un paciente?Para poder determinar el final de la relación del consejero, debemos comprender las metas y parámetros de la terapia.  Usualmente durante la evaluación inicial se identifican metas a corto y largo plazo con el cliente, y se discute con el cliente como esas metas serán alcanzadas.  Durante el proceso de terapia el consejero revisa las metas mensual o trimestralmente dependiendo de la frecuencia de las citas.  Ya que las metas de terapia son alcanzadas, hay una sesión de cierre y el cliente puede terminar la terapia.   En algunos casos el cliente puede identificar nuevas metas para la terapia y determinar si el mismo consejero u otro consejero le pueden asistir. 
La relación de consejería también puede terminar por no conformar o violentar los parámetros  establecidos para la terapia.   Tanto el consejero como el cliente pueden terminar la relación de terapia.  Como proveedores de salud mental los consejeros estamos obligados a proveer un razón para la conclusión del tratamiento y proveer referidos según aplique, los clientes no necesitan proveer una explicación, aunque es recomendable discutirlo en una sesión de cierre.","Okay, this is a really important and complex topic in counseling. Terminating therapy isn't something a counselor takes lightly. Here's a breakdown of how a counselor decides when to end sessions (a single session) or terminate the therapeutic relationship (ending all sessions), broken down into categories, along with ethical considerations.  It's a long answer, but it's a nuanced topic!

**I. Ending a *Single* Counseling Session (Session Termination)**

This is about what happens *within* a session. A counselor might end a session *before* the scheduled time is up for a variety of reasons:

*   **Time Limits:**  Most sessions have a set time (e.g., 50 minutes).  The counselor will give warning as the time nears and will wrap things up respectfully.
*   **Client Distress/Overwhelm:** If a client becomes acutely overwhelmed, highly anxious, panicky, or dissociative during a session, the counselor might end it early to prioritize the client's safety and well-being. This is often done with a plan for grounding or immediate support.
*   **Reaching a Natural Stopping Point:** Sometimes a topic is fully explored, a decision is made, or a skill is practiced to a point where continuing *that* specific discussion isn't productive at that moment.
*   **Safety Concerns:** If the client expresses imminent harm to self or others, the session may be interrupted to enact safety protocols (see section III).
*   **Unexpected Counselor Emergency:**  Rarely, a counselor might need to end a session abruptly due to a personal emergency.  They have an ethical obligation to offer support in finding alternative care in this situation.



**II. Terminating the *Therapeutic Relationship* (Ending All Sessions) –  Reasons & Process**

This is a much bigger decision. There are three main categories of reasons for termination:

*   **A. Client-Initiated Termination:**  The client decides to end therapy.
    *   **Goal Achievement:** The client feels they've met their goals and no longer need therapy. This is the *ideal* scenario.
    *   **Circumstance Changes:** The client's life situation has changed (e.g., moved, financial constraints, new job, improved support system) making continuing therapy impractical.
    *   **Dissatisfaction with Therapy:** The client doesn't feel therapy is helping, doesn't like the counselor's approach, or doesn't feel a good connection.  *This is crucial for the counselor to explore – see ""Process"" below.*
    *   **Client Decision Without Explanation:**  Sometimes clients simply stop showing up (""no-show"").  While frustrating, this also constitutes termination and requires the counselor to follow ethical guidelines (see section III).

*   **B. Counselor-Initiated Termination (More Complex - Requires Careful Justification):** The counselor decides to end therapy.  This is much rarer and requires careful consideration and documentation.  Reasons include:
    *   **Lack of Progress:** Despite reasonable effort, the client isn't making progress, and the counselor believes continuing isn't beneficial.
    *   **Non-Compliance:**  The client consistently misses appointments, doesn't complete agreed-upon work, or actively undermines the therapeutic process.
    *   **Ethical Concerns (see section III).**
    *   **Counselor Competence:** The counselor realizes the client's needs are beyond their scope of expertise.  (e.g., a counselor specializing in anxiety taking on a client with severe, untreated psychosis).  They have a duty to refer to a more appropriate provider.
    *   **Counselor Health/Personal Issues:**  (Rare)  If the counselor's personal circumstances would impair their ability to provide effective treatment, they may need to terminate, but must do so responsibly with appropriate referrals.

*   **C. Mutual Agreement:**  Both the client and counselor agree that it's time to end therapy. This often happens after a period of discussion and evaluation.



**III. Ethical Considerations & The Termination *Process***

This is the most important part.  Termination must be handled ethically and responsibly to avoid harm to the client.  Here's what a good counselor will do:

*   **Discuss Termination:**  *Never* a surprise.  The topic should be brought up well in advance (ideally several sessions before the anticipated end date).  The counselor should ask the client to explore their feelings about ending therapy.  ""How do you feel about us starting to talk about ending our sessions?""
*   **Explore Reasons for Client-Initiated Termination:** If the client wants to end, the counselor needs to understand *why*.  Is it goal achievement?  Dissatisfaction?  A relationship issue?  This is a chance to address any concerns and potentially repair the therapeutic relationship if appropriate.  Sometimes"
I was born a girl. I look like a boy. I sometimes feel like a different variation of gender. I don't know what to say if someone asks my gender. I just get really confused and usually say my birth gender.,"I agree with Sherry, it is OK to give the answer that you feel most familiar with.  The most important part is not who people think you are, but that you know who you are.  Read about gender identity and fluidity.  Discovering the answer is a process, don't rush it to comply with others either way.  If you feel that this is a constant issue that keeps you awake and keeps you from enjoying your life, consider going to a therapist to discuss your feelings and concerns. ¿Qué significa que yo me sienta como diferentes géneros?Nací como niña. Me veo como niño.  A veces siento como una variación diferente de género.  No sé qué decirle a otros cuando pregunta que soy.  Me siento confuso y solo digo mi genero de nacimiento. Estoy de acuerdo con Sherry, está bien dar la respuesta que se sienta más cómoda.  La parte más importante no es quien las otras personas piensen que eres, sino quien tú piensas que eres.  Lee sobre el tema de identidad de género y fluidez de género.  Descubrir tu género puede ser un proceso, no lo apresures para complacer a otras personas.  Si sientes que este tema te esta quitando el sueno y te impide disfrutar tu vida, habla con tu consejero sobre tus sentimientos y preocupaciones.","Okay, this sounds really confusing and frustrating, and it's completely understandable why you'd feel that way! It's brave of you to acknowledge these feelings and try to figure things out. Here's a breakdown of what you're experiencing, some things to consider, and how to navigate those tricky ""gender question"" moments.  I'll try to cover a lot of ground, and I'll add a disclaimer at the end.

**Understanding What You're Describing**

What you're describing touches on several possibilities, and it's important to remember *you don't need to label it right now*.  Exploring is okay. Here's a look at some things that might resonate:

* **Gender Dysphoria (potentially):**  This is a feeling of discomfort or distress because there's a mismatch between the gender you were assigned at birth and your gender identity. You don't mention distress specifically, but the feeling of being a ""different variation of gender"" *could* be linked to this. It's not required for being trans or non-binary, but it's something to consider.
* **Non-Binary:** This is an umbrella term for gender identities that fall outside the traditional ""male"" or ""female"" binary. There are *many* ways to be non-binary. Some non-binary people feel like a mix of both genders, some feel like neither, some fluctuate, and some identify in other ways. Your ""different variation"" feeling could absolutely fall under this.
* **Genderfluid:**  A genderfluid person's gender identity isn't fixed; it changes over time.  Sometimes you might feel more masculine, sometimes more feminine, sometimes somewhere in between, or something else entirely.
* **Agender:** Feeling like you don't have a gender at all.
* **Androgynous:** This describes a presentation (how you *look*) that blends masculine and feminine traits. You mention you *look* like a boy, and androgyny is about presentation.  It's not an identity in itself, but it can be a part of how someone expresses their gender.
* **Transgender:** While you were assigned female at birth, feeling a disconnect and identifying differently *could* mean you are transgender.  However, this doesn’t mean you need to identify as strictly male.  Transgender is an umbrella term and includes non-binary people.
* **Internalized Societal Expectations:**  Sometimes, feeling confused about gender comes from the pressure to fit into boxes that don't quite fit. Our society often has very rigid ideas about what it means to be a ""girl"" or a ""boy.""



**Why It's Okay to Be Confused**

* **Society Isn't Helpful:**  Our culture often forces people to pick a side (male/female) and doesn't leave much room for nuance.
* **It Takes Time:**  Figuring out your gender identity is a journey, not a destination. It's perfectly okay to explore and change your mind.
* **You're Valid Regardless:**  Whether you eventually land on a label, choose to remain unlabeled, or something in between, your feelings are valid.  You don't need to *prove* your gender to anyone.

**What to Say When Asked About Your Gender**

This is the tricky part! Here are some options, ranging from simple to more explanatory.  Choose what feels most comfortable *in the moment*.  You are NOT obligated to answer if you don't want to.

* **""I'm figuring that out.""**  Simple, honest, and sets a boundary.
* **""I don't really label.""**  This avoids specifying and is perfectly valid.
* **""That's a complicated question for me.""**  Acknowledges the difficulty without forcing an explanation.
* **""I prefer not to say.""**  A firm but polite boundary.
* **""I'm non-binary.""** (If you feel that fits, even if you're still exploring.)
* **""I'm transgender, and I'm still exploring what that means for me.""** (If you feel that fits.)
* **""I was assigned female at birth, but I don't identify with that label.""** (A bit more explanatory, but you don't have to go into detail.)
* **Redirect the question:** ""Why do you ask?"" or ""That's an interesting question, what made you think to ask?"" This puts the focus back on them.
* **Humor (if you're comfortable):** ""Oh, you know, the usual."" (said with a shrug and a smile). This can deflect the question, but it might not always work.

**Important Notes About Answering:**

* **You are in control.** You don'"
"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","Therapy is by nature a safe place to discuss difficult, or painful memories or experiences and thereby it is normal that feelings of all kinds, including sadness, loss, frustration, disappointment, etc may arise.  This is part of processing and bringing closure to things that may have been pushed aside for a lifetime and can now be faced and dealt with.  Change too is often not easy, and can lead to crying, whether from frustration and set back...or also from joy and accomplishment!","Okay, let's address this! It's **absolutely normal** to cry during therapy. In fact, it's *very* common. You are definitely not alone in experiencing this. It's a really good sign, actually, even though it doesn't *feel* good in the moment.

Here's a breakdown of why it happens and why it's okay, and why you might feel like you're the only one if you're worried:

**Why People Cry in Therapy:**

* **Safe Space:** Therapy is designed to be a safe and confidential space to explore difficult emotions.  You're *supposed* to feel comfortable enough to let your guard down, and that often unlocks emotions that have been held back.
* **Processing Trauma:** If you're working through past trauma, crying is a natural release of pent-up emotional energy.  It's a physical manifestation of grief, pain, and other intense feelings.
* **Vulnerability:**  Talking about personal struggles requires vulnerability.  Allowing yourself to be vulnerable can be emotionally overwhelming, leading to tears.
* **Realization & Insight:** Sometimes, crying happens *with* a realization.  You might suddenly understand something about yourself or a situation in a new way, and that can be powerfully emotional.
* **Simply Feeling Heard:**  Sometimes, just being truly *heard* and validated by a therapist, without judgment, can be enough to trigger tears.  It's a release of feeling understood.
* **Grief & Loss:** Whether it's the loss of a person, a dream, or a part of yourself, therapy can bring grief to the surface.
* **Overwhelm:**  Sometimes life is just overwhelming, and therapy is the place where it's okay to acknowledge that and let it out.



**Why You Might Think You're the Only One:**

* **Stigma:** There's still a stigma around showing emotion, even in a therapeutic setting.  You might worry about appearing ""weak"" or ""dramatic.""
* **Privacy:** Therapy is private. You don't see other people crying *in* therapy, so it's easy to assume it's not happening.
* **Individual Differences:** Everyone processes emotions differently. Some people are more prone to crying than others.  This doesn't mean your experience is any less valid.
* **Your Own History:** If you were taught to suppress emotions as a child, you might feel particularly self-conscious about crying.

**What Your Therapist Thinks:**

* **They Expect It:**  Good therapists *expect* clients to cry at times. They are trained to handle it with empathy and support.
* **They Won't Judge You:** A competent therapist will not judge you for crying.  Their role is to create a safe space for you to feel whatever you need to feel.
* **They Might Offer Support:** They might offer you tissues, a moment to collect yourself, or simply a supportive presence.  They might also explore *why* you're crying to help you understand your emotions better.
* **It's Valuable Information:** Your tears are information for the therapist.  They can help them understand the intensity of your feelings and tailor the therapy accordingly.



**What to do if you're worried about crying:**

* **It's okay to acknowledge it:** You can even say to your therapist, ""I'm worried I'm going to cry,"" or ""I'm feeling really emotional right now.""
* **Don't apologize for it:** You have nothing to apologize for!
* **Ask for a moment:** If you need a moment to compose yourself, ask for it.  ""Can I just have a minute?"" is perfectly acceptable.
* **Talk to your therapist about your concerns:** If you're consistently worried about crying, bring it up in session.  Your therapist can help you explore those feelings.




**In short: Crying in therapy is normal, healthy, and a sign that the process is working.**  Don't feel ashamed or embarrassed.  Allow yourself to feel your emotions. 

If you're still concerned, please, *please* talk to your therapist about it. They are the best resource to help you understand your experience.

If you don't know where she can go, there is probably a list of shelters for the county that you live in.","Okay, that gives me a good starting point! Here are some thoughts and potential directions, considering a young woman in her early 20s raising a toddler. I'll break it down into a few areas – her potential life situation, personality traits she might have developed, and story ideas.  To give you *really* helpful suggestions, tell me what you need this information *for* (are you writing a story? character development? just curious?). But here's a general overview:

**1. Life Situation - Common Realities:**

* **Education:**  Likely had to put education on hold, or is juggling childcare with classes (high school completion, college, trade school).  May feel pressure to finish, or may have resigned herself to a different path for now.
* **Financials:** Probably financially stressed.  Single income is tough.  May rely on family support, government assistance, or be working multiple jobs.  Financial instability is a major theme.
* **Housing:**  May live with family, in subsidized housing, or be struggling to afford rent.  The stability of her housing could be precarious.
* **Social Life:** Significantly impacted.  Free time is limited.  Friendships may have changed (some drifting away, some stepping up). Dating can be very difficult.
* **Support System:**  The strength of her support system (family, friends, partner - if any) is *critical*.  Lack of support can lead to significant challenges.
* **Career:**  Likely in entry-level jobs, or jobs that offer flexibility but low pay.  Career advancement is harder with childcare responsibilities.
* **Partner (if applicable):**  If she has a partner, their involvement and reliability are huge factors.  Is it a supportive, co-parenting relationship, or a source of stress?  Is he present? Absent?  Unreliable?

**2. Potential Personality Traits (shaped by her situation):**

* **Resilience:**  She's *had* to be resilient.  She's facing challenges most people her age don't.
* **Maturity (forced):**  She's likely more mature than her peers.  She's had responsibilities thrust upon her that have aged her quickly.
* **Responsibility:**  A strong sense of responsibility is essential for caring for a child.
* **Anxiety/Stress:** High levels of stress and anxiety are common, related to finances, childcare, and future uncertainty.
* **Selflessness:**  She likely prioritizes her child's needs above her own.
* **Resourcefulness:**  She's had to learn to make do with less, to find creative solutions.
* **Determination:**  She wants to provide for her child and give them a good life.
* **Guilt:**  May feel guilty about not being able to give her child everything, or about needing to leave the child for work/school.
* **Hidden Dreams:**  She may have dreams and aspirations that feel out of reach right now.  She might be grieving the life she thought she'd have.
* **Protective:** Fiercely protective of her child.



**3. Story Ideas/Character Arcs (just brainstorming):**

* **The Struggle to Finish School:** A story about her balancing motherhood with pursuing her education. The challenges, the sacrifices, and the triumphs.
* **Finding Love (Again):**  Navigating the complexities of dating as a young single mother.  Dealing with judgment, finding someone accepting, and protecting her child.
* **Escaping a Difficult Situation:**  If there's an unsupportive or abusive partner, a story about her finding the strength to leave and build a better life for herself and her child.
* **Breaking the Cycle:**  If she comes from a difficult background, a story about her determined to provide a different life for her child.
* **The Unexpected Career Path:**  A story about her discovering a talent or passion she never knew she had, and building a career around it.  (Maybe something flexible and work-from-home).
* **The Power of Community:**  A story about her finding support and friendship in unexpected places (support groups, community centers, etc.).
* **Reclaiming Her Identity:** A story about her finding time for herself amidst the demands of motherhood, and rediscovering who she is.



**To help me narrow down what would be most useful for *you*, tell me:**

* **What are you using this information for?** (e.g., writing a novel, short story, screenplay, roleplaying, just character brainstorming?)
* **What *kind* of story/character are you aiming for?** (e.g., realistic drama, hopeful romance, gritty crime, etc.)
* **What is her toddler like?** (Age, personality, any special needs"
I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.,"Sometimes we make ourselves feel worse with our own thoughts about things we can't change. We know that it is possible to overcome embarrassment and self-blame, but why does it seem so difficult to overcome it sometimes? If you tune into your own thoughts, or your ""internal dialogue"", you'll notice that your thoughts are connected to your feelings. So people who are holding onto embarrassment and self-blame often have thoughts like, ""How could I do that?"", ""I looked so stupid!"" ""Now people saw things I did not want them to see!"" If we tune in more, we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible, horrible, and that we cannot deal with it. These are self-sabotaging thoughts that lead to shame, self-blame and embarrassment. If you look at the evidence, you can find more rational thoughts such as, "" We all make mistakes"", ""People can look all different ways at different time - this incident does not define me!"" and ""If someone has a bad image or thought about me, it is really OK! People have all kinds of thoughts about other people, and it does not have to be a major problem."" When you practice your rational thoughts often and replace the negative ones, you will start to feel better, more confident and your embarrassment will decrease quickly.","Okay, that's a really tough situation, and I'm so sorry that happened to you. It's completely understandable that you'd be embarrassed – that comment was inappropriate and frankly, *his* behavior is the problem, not yours.  You're putting yourself out there to *teach* and help others, and to be subjected to that kind of comment is awful. Let's break down how to deal with this, both in the moment (if it happens again) and emotionally.

**First, let's address the core issue: His comment was unacceptable.**

*   **It's about *him*, not you.**  Kids (and even sometimes adults) can be thoughtless and lack social boundaries. His comment says more about his upbringing and lack of respect than it does about your body or your swimsuit.  It was a boundary violation.
*   **You were doing your job.** You were there to *work* and to teach a valuable life skill. His comment tried to shift the focus to your appearance, which is irrelevant and unprofessional.
*   **It's never okay to comment on someone's body like that.** Period.



**Here's how you can handle it *if* it happens again (this is for future preparedness, and you don't have to use all of these, pick what feels comfortable):**

*   **Directly address the behavior (if you feel safe and comfortable):** This can be surprisingly effective.  Keep it short and firm. Examples:
    *   ""That comment was inappropriate, and I'd appreciate it if you didn't say things like that again.""
    *   ""My swimsuit is appropriate for my job, and your comment is distracting.""
    *   ""We're here to focus on swimming, not on appearances.""
*   **Ignore and redirect:**  Sometimes, especially with younger children, giving the comment *no* attention is the best course of action.  Just continue with the lesson as if he hadn't said anything.  Immediately refocus the class: ""Okay, everyone, let's practice our float on our backs...""
*   **Report it to a supervisor:** This is the *most important* thing.  You are in a professional training environment, and they need to know this happened. (See the ""Reporting it to a Supervisor"" section below)
*    **Don't engage in a debate:** Do not try to justify your swimsuit or explain yourself. That reinforces the idea that his comment was valid and requires a response.




**Dealing with Your Embarrassment & Emotions Right Now:**

*   **Acknowledge your feelings:** It's okay to be embarrassed, upset, angry, or a combination of all three. Don't minimize your feelings. It *was* a bad experience.
*   **Talk to someone you trust:**  A friend, family member, another instructor, or a counselor.  Sharing what happened can help you process it and feel less alone.  Just verbalizing it can be incredibly helpful.
*   **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself. You didn't do anything wrong. You were doing your job, and you were subjected to an inappropriate comment. Treat yourself with the same compassion you would offer a friend in the same situation.
*   **Remember your ""why"":** You're becoming a Water Safety Instructor to help people. Focus on that positive purpose.  Don't let one person's thoughtlessness derail your passion.
* **It is not your responsibility to police the behavior of others.** You can't control what people say, but you *can* control how you react and how you protect yourself.

**Reporting it to a Supervisor:**

This is CRUCIAL.  Even if you feel like it wasn't a ""big deal,"" reporting it creates a record and allows the training organization to address the situation and prevent it from happening to you or others.

*   **Who to tell:** Your instructor, the head of the WSI program, or the facility manager. Whoever is in charge of the training.
*   **What to say:** Be clear and factual.  You don't need to dramatize it, just state what happened.
    *   ""I wanted to let you know about an incident that occurred during class today.  One of the students, [Boy's Name if you know it, otherwise describe him], made an inappropriate comment about my swimsuit. He said [repeat the comment as accurately as you can].  It made me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed.""
    *   ""I'm concerned about this behavior and wanted to bring it to your attention.""
*   **What you can expect:** A good supervisor will:
    *   Thank you for reporting it.
    *   Take it seriously.
    *   Address the situation with the student (and potentially their parents"
I would like to be able to have more positive relationships in the present.,"Remember, the past no longer exists and the future is just an illusion as we don't know what will happen tomorrow, so take the present as your guide. That is all we can do, so keep saying this to yourself and try to help someone each day.  The happiness is helping others to feel a bit better.","Okay, that's a fantastic goal! Building and nurturing positive relationships takes effort, but it's *so* worth it. Here's a breakdown of strategies, broken down into sections, to help you cultivate more positive relationships *right now*.  I'll cover self-work, how to interact with others, and how to deal with challenges.  It's a lot, so feel free to focus on a few areas to start.  I'll also add sections at the end on seeking further help.

**I. Self-Work: The Foundation of Good Relationships**

Before you can have great relationships with others, you need to be in a good place with yourself.

*   **Self-Awareness:** This is key.
    *   **Identify Your Patterns:** What are your typical ways of interacting with people? Are you often critical, withdrawn, eager to please, controlling, or something else?  Knowing this helps you understand *why* things might be going wrong.
    *   **Understand Your Needs & Boundaries:** What do *you* need in a relationship to feel safe, respected, and happy? What are your limits?  Knowing these helps you communicate them (see below).
    *   **Reflect on Past Relationships:**  What patterns keep repeating? What roles do you tend to play?  What did you learn from past successes and failures?  (Don't dwell on blame, focus on *learning*.)
*   **Self-Esteem:**  Healthy self-esteem is attractive.  (Not in a narcissistic way, but in a genuinely confident way.)
    *   **Practice Self-Compassion:**  Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend.
    *   **Focus on Your Strengths:**  What are you good at? What do you like about yourself?  Make a list and revisit it often.
    *   **Challenge Negative Self-Talk:**  When you have a critical thought, ask yourself if it's really true and if it's helpful.
*   **Emotional Regulation:** Learning to manage your emotions is vital.
    *   **Identify Your Triggers:** What situations or behaviors tend to upset you?
    *   **Develop Coping Mechanisms:**  Deep breathing, mindfulness, exercise, journaling, spending time in nature – find what works for *you*.  Use these *before* you react.
    *   **Acceptance:**  Accepting your emotions (even the unpleasant ones) without judgment is a powerful skill.



**II.  How to Interact with Others: Building Positive Connections**

These are things you can start doing *today* to improve your interactions.

*   **Active Listening:** This is HUGE.
    *   **Pay Attention:**  Put away distractions (phone, thoughts about what *you're* going to say).
    *   **Show You're Listening:**  Nod, make eye contact (comfortable eye contact - not staring!), and use verbal cues like ""uh-huh"" or ""I see.""
    *   **Reflect Back:**  Paraphrase what you heard: ""So, it sounds like you're saying...""  This shows you're understanding and encourages them to elaborate.
    *   **Ask Clarifying Questions:** ""Can you tell me more about that?""
*   **Effective Communication:**
    *   **""I"" Statements:** Express your feelings and needs without blaming others.  Instead of ""You always make me feel..."", try ""I feel... when... because...""
    *   **Be Clear and Direct:** Avoid hinting or expecting people to read your mind.  Politely and respectfully state what you want or need.
    *   **Non-Verbal Communication:** Be mindful of your body language.  Open posture, relaxed facial expressions, and a warm tone of voice convey openness and friendliness.
*   **Empathy:** Try to understand things from the other person's perspective.
    *   **Ask about their feelings:** “How are you feeling about this?”
    *   **Validate their feelings:** Even if you don’t agree, acknowledge their right to feel the way they do. “That sounds really frustrating.”
*   **Kindness and Appreciation:**
    *   **Offer Compliments:**  Sincere compliments brighten someone's day.
    *   **Express Gratitude:**  Say ""thank you"" often.  Specifically mention *what* you're thankful for.
    *   **Small Acts of Kindness:**  Offer to help with a task, bring someone a coffee, or simply send a thoughtful text.
*   **Be Present:**  When you're with someone, be *with* them.  Put away distractions and truly focus on the interaction.
*  **Initiate Contact:**  Don't always wait for others to reach out.  Send"
"The eight months I've been dating my boyfriend, I have lied about a lot of things. I slept with a couple guys to get back at my boyfriend for breaking up with me. Now anything I say to him he won't believe, even if I'm being honest. I don't know what else to do at this point. He constantly criticizes me.","Start a conversation with him about your sincere interest to earn back his trust.Ask him what he expects from you so that he will trust you again.If you are consciously willing and do try to earn back his trust, and have periodic conversations with him on whether he feels more at ease with trusting you, then after a few months of this, both of you should feel more secure in the relationship.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's good you're recognizing the damage that's been done and wanting to address it. It's also brave of you to admit the things you've done. Let's break this down, and I'll offer some thoughts and suggestions.  This will be a long response, because it's a complex issue.  I'll cover several areas: understanding the situation, what you need to do, what he needs to do, and whether the relationship is salvageable.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is not a substitute for professional help.**

**1. Understanding the Situation**

* **You broke his trust.** The biggest issue here isn't just *that* you lied, but the *extent* of the lies and the nature of them.  Sleeping with others as revenge is particularly damaging. It goes beyond simple dishonesty and touches on betrayal and disrespect.  He's right to feel he can't trust you. Trust is the foundation of any relationship, and you’ve significantly eroded it.
* **His reaction is (understandably) a consequence.**  While constant criticism isn't healthy (more on that later), his disbelief is a direct result of your actions. He's protecting himself. He's been hurt, and his brain is now primed to question everything you say.
* **The cycle of hurt:** Your actions stemmed from hurt *he* caused initially (the breakup). You responded with actions that caused more hurt, and now you're both trapped in a cycle of pain and mistrust.
* **The criticism is likely a manifestation of his pain.** While not *justified* as a healthy way to cope, his criticism probably stems from his hurt, anger, and insecurity. He’s likely lashing out because he feels vulnerable and unsafe.
* **You're in a difficult position.** You feel trapped, and you're likely experiencing guilt, shame, and anxiety.  



**2. What *You* Need to Do**

This is where the hard work begins.  There are no quick fixes.

* **Full, Unconditional Honesty (Even When it's Hard):** This is non-negotiable.  You need to stop *all* lying, about everything. Even seemingly small things.  Start building a track record of truthfulness, even if it means admitting things that are uncomfortable.
* **Take Full Responsibility:**  No minimizing, no justifying, no blaming him for *your* choices.  Own your actions. A sincere apology is crucial, but apologies without changed behavior are meaningless. Something like: ""I am deeply sorry for lying to you and for betraying your trust. I understand that my actions were wrong and incredibly hurtful, and I take full responsibility for them. There's no excuse for what I did.""  (Don't just say it once, you'll need to revisit this.)
* **Be Patient:** Rebuilding trust takes *time* – a lot of it.  Months, even years.  You can't expect him to suddenly believe you.  Be prepared for him to question you, and respond with patience and honesty.  Don't get defensive.
* **Accept the Consequences:** He may need space. He may need to process his emotions independently.  He may need to pull back emotionally. You need to respect his needs, even if they're painful for you.
* **Focus on Actions, Not Just Words:**  Show him through your behavior that you're committed to honesty and change.  Be reliable, be consistent, and follow through on your promises.
* **Self-Reflection: Why did you lie?**  Understanding the root of your dishonesty is vital. Were you afraid of his reaction?  Did you feel insecure?  Did you lack healthy coping mechanisms for dealing with your feelings?  This is where therapy can be incredibly helpful (see disclaimer).
* **Stop Defending Yourself:** It's natural to want to explain, but right now, explanations will likely sound like excuses. Focus on acknowledging his pain and demonstrating your commitment to change.



**3. What *He* Needs to Do (and You Can't Control This)**

This is the challenging part, because you can't force him to do any of this.

* **Willingness to Forgive (Eventually):** Forgiveness isn't about excusing your actions, it's about releasing the anger and resentment that's poisoning him. This will take time, and it may not happen.
* **Willingness to Communicate (Healthily):**  He needs to be able to express his feelings *without* resorting to constant criticism or attacks.  He needs to learn to communicate his needs and boundaries.
* **Professional Help (Individual or Couples Therapy):**  A therapist can provide a safe space for both of you"
"My fiancé doesn't think I trust him because I was cheated on before. However, he hides his phone and has been texting his ex-girlfriend, who he has two kids with. What should I do?","Oh Chino, I only have half the picture here so I will be cautious. There's a chicken and an egg, and I don't know which came first. One thing I see clearly is that your fiance will always have to have communications with his ex, because they have children. Can you accept that? When suspicion and insecurity come along, your job is to look at the big picture and the real picture. Is there any real evidence that he is cheating? Remember that texting his ex is not evidence alone if the communications are about the kids. Has he earned your trust? If so, then it's not fair to punish him for the betrayals of others. He's not your ex. Reassure your heart that you are his priority if the larger evidence supports that. At the same time, you can let him know what your triggers are. For example, hiding his phone doesn't send you a good message, right? See, this is the chicken and the egg...is he hiding the phone because you've been overreacting when he gets a text?  So let him know you won't blow up about him getting a text if he doesn't conceal or password his phone. Transparency helps build trust. You have sensitivities, and it helps you a lot if he's aware of them and willing to try not to do things that trigger fear. Let him know when you get scared, and hopefully he'll give you the openness and security you need in order to trust him and act as if you trust him.  :)","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's understandable why you're feeling conflicted and hurt. You're dealing with the fallout of past trauma *and* current concerning behavior. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering communication, boundaries, and self-care, broken down into steps.  It's long, but thorough, because this is important.

**1. Understand the Layers of the Problem**

* **Your Past Trauma:** Your fiancé is right to recognize that your past infidelity experience impacts your trust. It's natural to be more sensitive and potentially project fears onto the current relationship. That doesn't *excuse* his behavior, but it explains *why* you're reacting strongly.  You are allowed to feel insecure and need reassurance.
* **His Behavior:**  Hiding his phone is a **major red flag**.  Even *if* the texts are innocent, the secrecy itself is a breach of trust.  Texting an ex is not inherently wrong (especially with shared children), but the *combination* of that with the secrecy is deeply problematic.  The fact he has children with his ex adds a layer of complexity, but doesn't justify hiding communication.
* **The Core Issue: Trust is Earned, Not Demanded:** He's accusing you of not trusting him *while simultaneously* behaving in ways that erode trust. This is a classic example of projection and manipulation. He's trying to shift the blame for his actions onto you.



**2. Calm, Direct Communication (Choose the Right Time & Place)**

* **Pick a Good Time:** Don't ambush him. Choose a time when you both are relatively calm, not stressed, and have uninterrupted time to talk.  Avoid discussing this when you're already arguing or right before an important event.
* **""I"" Statements:**  This is crucial. Focus on *your* feelings and observations, not accusations.  Here are some examples:
    *  Instead of: ""You're hiding your phone and texting your ex, you're clearly untrustworthy!""
    *  Try: ""I've noticed you've been keeping your phone private, and I'm feeling anxious and insecure about that, especially given my past experiences.  I also learned about the texts with your ex, and I feel hurt and confused.""
    *  Instead of: ""You're making me feel crazy!""
    *  Try:  ""When I see you hide your phone, I start to feel very anxious and my past experiences resurface, which makes it hard for me to feel secure in our relationship.""
* **Be Specific:** Don't be vague.  Mention the phone hiding and the texts specifically. ""I saw you quickly turn your phone screen away when I came into the room,"" or ""I found out you've been exchanging text messages with [Ex's Name].""  (How you found out matters - see point 4).
* **Ask Direct Questions:**
    *  ""Why are you hiding your phone?""  (Listen carefully to the answer.  Is it a reasonable explanation, or evasive?)
    *  ""What is the nature of your communication with [Ex's Name]?"" (Again, listen to the specifics.  Is it solely about the children, or is there more?)
    * ""Why do you feel I don't trust you?"" (Let him articulate his feelings, but don't let him derail the conversation.)
* **State Your Needs:** ""I need to feel like I can trust you.  That means openness and honesty.  I need you to be willing to share what's going on with your phone without me having to ask.""



**3.  Establish Clear Boundaries (And Consequences)**

* **Transparency is Key:**  A healthy relationship involves a reasonable level of transparency.  Hiding a phone is *not* reasonable.  You are not being controlling by asking for honesty.
* **Examples of Boundaries:**
    *  ""I'm not comfortable with you hiding your phone.  I need you to be willing to let me see it if I ask, or at least be open about who you're communicating with.""
    *  ""While I understand you need to communicate with your ex about the children, I need to be aware of those conversations.  Perhaps you could let me know when you've been texting, or even occasionally show me the exchange (specifically regarding the kids)."" (This one is tougher and depends on your comfort level – it’s okay to say you're not comfortable seeing everything, but need to know it's focused on co-parenting).
    * ""I need you to stop accusing me of not trusting you when you are actively engaging in behaviors that break down trust.""
* **Consequences (Think This Through):** This is the hard part."
I just wanted to get to know one so I can hear about their college experience and the courses they took. I also wanted to know if they enjoy their job and how long they were in school.,"It's a great idea for you to reach out to find a psychologist to talk to if this is a field you might be interested in pursuing. Regarding the length of schooling, it generally takes 4 years of college and an additional 4 to 7 years of graduate school to earn a doctorate degree to become a psychologist. There are also other similar professions, including counseling that don't require a doctorate degree. Licensed counselors generally completed 4 years of college and an additional 2 years of graduate school. If you are thinking about a career in psychology, the local APA chapter would be a good place to start to find a local psychologist to talk to. Here's a link to the NJ APA chapter:https://www.psychologynj.org/","Okay, that's a great idea! I can absolutely play the role of a recent college graduate. Here's my ""backstory"" and answers to your questions.  I'll try to be detailed and give you a good feel for the experience.  I'll portray myself as **Maya Sharma**, who graduated in May 2023.

**Hi! I'm Maya Sharma. It's nice to meet you!**  I just finished up my first year working as a Data Analyst at a small marketing firm in Chicago. It's been a whirlwind, but a good one!  I'm happy to chat about my college experience and what I'm doing now.  Ask me anything!

**Let's start with how long I was in school:**

I was a full-time student for four years, so a pretty standard college timeline. I started in Fall 2019 and graduated in May 2023 from the University of Michigan - Go Blue!  I didn't do any dual enrollment in high school, and I stayed on track with all my credits.  There was definitely a period during the pandemic where things felt... strange, but I made it through!

**Now, about my college experience...**

I would describe it as transformative, honestly. I came in pretty shy and unsure of what I wanted to do, and left feeling much more confident in my abilities and with a much clearer direction.  

The campus was *huge*, which was intimidating at first. But that also meant there were so many opportunities - clubs, events, research, everything. I really threw myself into extracurriculars. I was heavily involved in the Data Science Club, which was amazing for networking and learning practical skills. I also volunteered at a local non-profit, helping them with data organization and reporting – that was really rewarding.  Socially, it took me a little while to find *my* people, but I ended up with a really close-knit group of friends who I still talk to regularly.

Living in a dorm for the first two years was a classic college experience.  Lots of late-night conversations, shared meals, and, yeah, some noise!  I moved into an off-campus apartment with a few friends for my junior and senior years, which gave us more independence and allowed us to cook (and burn!) our own food.

**And finally, the courses I took...**

I majored in **Statistics with a minor in Computer Science**. It was a pretty demanding curriculum, but I really enjoyed it. Here are some of the key courses I took:

*   **Calculus I & II:** The fundamentals, obviously!  Not my *favorite*, but necessary.
*   **Linear Algebra:** This was a breakthrough course for me. It really clicked, and it's used constantly in data science.
*   **Probability & Statistics:**  Core to my major. We covered everything from basic descriptive statistics to hypothesis testing and regression analysis.
*   **Statistical Modeling:** A more advanced course where we learned how to build and evaluate statistical models.
*   **Data Structures & Algorithms:** This was part of my computer science minor. It was challenging, but taught me how to write efficient code.
*   **Data Mining:**  This is where things really got exciting! Learning about techniques for extracting meaningful insights from large datasets.
*   **Machine Learning:**  I took two courses in machine learning – one introductory and one more advanced. We worked on projects using Python and various machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow).
*   **Database Management:**  SQL was a big part of this, learning how to query and manage databases.
*   **Data Visualization:**  Learning how to tell stories with data using tools like Tableau and Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn.

I also took a few electives outside of my major, like a creative writing class (surprisingly fun!) and an economics course.

**As for my job...**

I *really* enjoy my job! It's a great fit for my skills and interests.  I basically help the marketing team understand campaign performance, identify trends in customer behavior, and make data-driven recommendations. I spend a lot of time cleaning and analyzing data, building dashboards, and presenting my findings to stakeholders.  

It's definitely a learning curve. College gave me the theoretical foundation, but learning to apply those concepts in a real-world business setting is different. There's a lot more ambiguity and collaboration involved. I'm constantly learning new things, which I love.  The team is really supportive, and I feel like I'm making a valuable contribution.

We've been dating for two months now. I have a heavy past that gets him angry. Does he have a right to penalize me for things I did before I met him?,"Not in my book. You're only two months in? At this early stage, this is a bit of a warning sign. If he can't accept or feel comfortable with who you are and decisions you've made, there's already a level of discomfort here that shouldn't be ignored. No, he doesn't have the right to penalize you or punish you ...not just for past things...not for anything. What he does get to do it tell you how it affects him. Sure...if he feels uncomfortable or needs reassurance...listen to those things. But If he doesn't dig who you are, maybe he can walk the other way.","Okay, this is a really important and common issue in relationships, especially when someone has a complex past. Let's break this down.  It's a nuanced situation, and the answer isn't a simple yes or no. Here's a comprehensive look at it, covering his feelings, your boundaries, and healthy relationship dynamics:

**Understanding His Anger**

First, let's try to understand *why* he's getting angry. It's not necessarily about the *things* you did, but rather what those things *represent* to him. Some possibilities:

*   **Betrayal of Trust (Even if it Pre-Dates Him):**  He might feel a sense of betrayal, even if logically he knows it happened before you were together. He's building trust *with you now*, and information about your past can feel like a crack in that foundation.  This is especially true if it involves infidelity, dishonesty, or actions that conflict with his values.
*   **Fear of Recurrence:** He might be worried that patterns from your past will repeat themselves in the relationship.  If your past involves harmful behaviors, he might fear you'll revert to those behaviors.
*   **Insecurity:** Your past relationships or experiences might make him feel insecure about his place in your life. He might worry he's not ""enough"" compared to someone from your past.
*   **Judgment & Values:** He might have strong moral or personal values that clash with things you've done. Even if he understands it was in the past, he might struggle to reconcile it with his view of you.
*   **Triggering His Own Past:** Sometimes, someone's reaction isn't about *your* past, but about *their* own unresolved issues or traumas. Your disclosures might have inadvertently touched a nerve.
* **Lack of Control:** He can't control your past, and that can be frustrating for some people.

**Does He Have a ""Right"" to Penalize You?**

This is the core question.  **No, he does not have a right to *penalize* you for things you did before you met him.**  ""Penalize"" implies punishment, withholding affection, controlling behavior, or holding something over your head continuously. That's not healthy or fair. 

Here's why:

*   **You Weren't His Responsibility:** You were a different person, in a different context, with different responsibilities and levels of maturity.  He didn't have a stake in your decisions then.
*   **People Change:**  People learn from their mistakes and grow.  Your past does not define who you are *now*.
*   **Present-Day Behavior Matters Most:** A healthy relationship focuses on how you treat each other *now* – your honesty, respect, communication, and commitment.
* **It's Controlling:** Using your past against you is a form of control. A partner should want to build a future with you, not dwell on things you can't change.



**What *Is* Reasonable?**

While he doesn't have a right to penalize, it *is* reasonable for him to:

*   **Ask Questions (Respectfully):** He's allowed to ask questions to understand your past, especially if it's relevant to the relationship.  However, those questions should be asked with genuine curiosity and a desire to understand, *not* to judge or accuse.
*   **Express His Feelings:** He's allowed to say, ""That's difficult for me to hear,"" or ""I need some time to process this.""  Acknowledging his feelings is valid.
*   **Set Boundaries for Himself:** He's allowed to decide what he's comfortable with in the relationship *moving forward*.  For example, if your past involved infidelity, he might need extra reassurance and honesty from you.  This is a boundary *he* sets for *his* own peace of mind.
*   **Need Time to Process:**  Learning about a partner's past can be a lot to take in. He may need time to come to terms with it.

**What You Need to Do**

1.  **Open and Honest Communication:**  Talk to him!  ""I understand you're upset, and I'm willing to talk about my past. However, I need you to understand that I've grown and changed.  I'm committed to this relationship, and I'm not the person I was then.""
2.  **Set Your Boundaries:**  This is crucial.  You need to clearly state what you *will not* tolerate.  For example:
    *   ""I'm happy to discuss my past, but I won't repeatedly rehash it.""
    *   ""I won't accept being made to feel guilty for things"
"My roommate has had a drinking problem for a while. She goes out, gets trashed, and then expects everyone to take care of her. The next morning, she apologizes constantly until she feels validated. She also thinks everyone hates her all the time. If I don't seem anything other than happy, she asks me ""Do you hate me? You hate me. Tell me you love me,"" and I feel like I have to pity her because she has also been suicidal before.","It does sound like your roommate may have a drinking problem, and the short answer is that you can't do anything about it, only she can. We can't change what other people say, think, or do. We can only change our reactions. It does sound like your roommate may be having a hard time. You can suggest that she enter counseling or therapy. You can reassure her that you like her (if that's true), but you don't have to pity her.","Okay, this is a really tough situation. You're walking a very difficult line between wanting to be supportive of a friend who is struggling, and protecting your own emotional well-being while navigating potentially manipulative behavior. It's good that you're recognizing the patterns and feeling overwhelmed – that's a sign you need to think strategically about how to handle this. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, and how to approach it, broken down into sections.  I'll cover the drinking, the emotional manipulation, the suicidal ideation, and how to protect yourself.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is not a substitute for professional help.**

**1. Understanding the Dynamics at Play**

* **The Alcohol Use Disorder:** Your roommate's behavior strongly suggests a problem with alcohol.  The pattern of getting excessively drunk and needing care is a classic sign.  Alcohol isn't *causing* her underlying issues, but it's likely exacerbating them and reducing her ability to cope.
* **The Cycle of Behavior:** You've perfectly described a cycle:  Intoxication -> Dependent/Needy Behavior -> Apologies & Seeking Reassurance -> Fear of Abandonment -> Demands for Affection.  This is a deeply ingrained pattern, and she's likely using these behaviors to manage intense emotional pain.
* **Emotional Manipulation:** The ""Do you hate me? You hate me. Tell me you love me"" is a direct attempt to elicit a specific emotional response from you. It puts you in a position where you feel *obligated* to provide reassurance, even if you don't genuinely feel it in that moment.  It's a way for her to test your loyalty and control the interaction. It's a form of emotional blackmail.
* **Underlying Issues:** Her constant fear of being hated and the past suicidal ideation suggest deeper issues like low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, or potentially a personality disorder (though I absolutely cannot diagnose her – that requires a professional).  These issues are likely driving both the drinking and the seeking of constant reassurance.
* **The Pity Factor & Your Responsibility:**  You feel compelled to respond because of her past suicide attempt.  That's incredibly understandable and shows you're a compassionate person. However, *you are not responsible for her emotional regulation or her choices.*  Feeling pity is natural, but letting it dictate your actions can be harmful to both of you.



**2.  How to Respond (and What to Stop Doing)**

This is the hardest part.  Here's a phased approach:

* **Stop Reassuring on Demand:** This is crucial, but very difficult.  When she asks ""Do you hate me?"" *do not immediately jump to reassure her.*  Instead, try these responses:
    * **Neutrality:** ""That's an interesting question."" (Said calmly, without emotion).
    * **Redirect:** ""I'm not going to answer that right now.""  or ""Let's talk about something else.""
    * **Boundary Setting:** ""I'm not comfortable answering questions like that when you're asking them in this way.""
    * **Reflect the Feeling:** ""It sounds like you're feeling really insecure right now."" (This acknowledges her *feeling* without validating the question itself.)
    * **Short and Simple:** ""I care about you."" (Said without a lot of emotion. A simple statement, not a drawn-out declaration of love).
    * **Important:**  Be prepared for her to escalate.  She *will* likely push back.  Stay firm and repeat your boundary.
* **Address the Drinking (Carefully):** This is best done *when she is sober* and calm.  Avoid accusations.  Focus on the *impact* of her behavior on *you*.
    * **""I"" Statements:**  ""I feel worried when you come home intoxicated and I have to help you.""  ""I find it difficult to live with someone who drinks to the point of needing assistance.""  ""I need to be able to rely on you to be responsible for your own safety.""
    * **Don’t get into debates about *why* she drinks.** Focus on the *behavior* and *your* feelings about it.
    * **Don't enable:** Stop ""taking care of her"" when she's drunk.  This means not cleaning up after her, not making her food, not staying up all night worrying. (This is VERY hard, and might mean calling a sober friend of hers to help.)
* **Limit Emotional Investment:** This doesn’t mean you don’t care. It means protecting your own energy.  Don't get drawn into long conversations about how much she dislikes herself.  Listen briefly, but don't offer endless reassurance.
* **Focus on Your Own Life:**"
"After first meeting the client, what is the process that a counselor facilitates?","Hi.  This is an excellent question !   I think that the answer probably varies depending upon the particular therapist .  In my work with people , once we have met and I have gotten an idea of the person'a concerns and the issues they want help with , I spend the next few sessions gathering as much history and as much information about the client's current concerns in order to formulate some ideas about what may be causing distress .  I would then share my thoughts with the client to see if they feel I am understanding them and on the right track.  We would then discuss the best plan to address the client's concerns .  Usually I will suggest strategies that I think may be helpful and ask the client for feedback about whether or not they think my suggestions feel helpful .   I always encourage clients to be really honest with me about this.  I tell them that I would hate for them to agree to try things that they know they won't try just to avoid ""hurting my feelings"" or ""offending me.""  I want to be helpful and while I have the expertise as far as typically helpful  strategies, I really like to work collaboratively and have clients tell me what they do and don't like / agree with or not agree with when I share my thoughts about a treatment plan .  We the   work together to come up with a plan that will be helpful , but also realistic and then revise it and try new things if necessary as we go along.   If things aren't improving , I am very happy and willing to try something new ! I hope this is helpful for you ! ","Okay, let's break down the process a counselor typically facilitates *after* that initial client meeting (often called an intake session). This is a multi-stage process, and it's important to remember that it's rarely linear – it often loops back on itself. Here's a detailed overview, categorized for clarity:

**Phase 1: Building the Foundation (Sessions 2-5, roughly - can vary)**

This phase is all about establishing a strong therapeutic alliance and gathering more in-depth information.  It's about safety, trust, and collaborative understanding.

*   **Deepening Rapport:**  The counselor continues to build trust and rapport. This is *crucial*.  Clients need to feel comfortable and safe to share vulnerable information. Techniques include active listening, empathy, genuineness, and unconditional positive regard.
*   **Exploration & Assessment (More In-Depth):**  While the intake covered basics, this phase dives deeper. The counselor will:
    *   **Explore the Presenting Problem:**  Get a very detailed understanding of the client's difficulties – when they started, how they manifest, what triggers them, how the client *experiences* them (thoughts, feelings, sensations, behaviors).  It's not just ""I'm anxious,"" but *what does anxiety feel like for *you*?* What happens when you feel anxious?  What do you do?
    *   **History Taking:**  A more thorough life history is collected. This includes:
        *   **Developmental History:**  Early childhood experiences, family dynamics, significant life events.
        *   **Social History:**  Relationships, support systems, cultural background, current social functioning.
        *   **Educational/Occupational History:**  School experiences, work history, career goals.
        *   **Medical History:**  Physical health, medications, substance use (if any). *Counselors will usually NOT diagnose medical conditions, but understanding medical factors is vital.*
        *   **Mental Health History:** Previous therapy, diagnoses (if any), hospitalizations, suicide attempts/ideation.
    *   **Assessment Tools (Optional):**  The counselor *may* use standardized questionnaires or assessments to get a more objective measure of symptoms (e.g., Beck Depression Inventory, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale).  These are used to *inform* the process, not *define* the client.
*   **Identifying Strengths:**  It's *not* just about problems! Counselors actively look for and highlight the client's strengths, resources, coping mechanisms, and values.  This is empowering and builds hope.
*   **Goal Setting (Initial):**  *Collaboratively* with the client, begin to define what the client wants to achieve in therapy.  These goals should be:
    *   **SMART:** Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.
    *   Client-centered: The goals must reflect what the *client* wants, not what the counselor thinks they should want.
*   **Psychoeducation:**  The counselor may provide information about the client’s potential diagnosis (if any), the therapeutic approach being used, and how therapy works. This empowers the client to be an active participant.



**Phase 2: Working Phase (Majority of Therapy - can be months/years)**

This is where the core work happens.  It's characterized by focused interventions designed to address the client's goals.

*   **Choosing a Therapeutic Approach:**  Based on the assessment and the client's needs, the counselor uses a specific therapeutic model (or integration of models).  Common approaches include:
    *   **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.
    *   **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):**  Helps clients regulate emotions, tolerate distress, and improve relationships.  Often used with trauma and borderline personality disorder.
    *   **Psychodynamic Therapy:**  Explores unconscious patterns and past experiences to gain insight.
    *   **Humanistic Therapy (e.g., Person-Centered):**  Emphasizes the client's inherent capacity for growth and self-actualization.
    *   **Family Systems Therapy:**  Views the client within the context of their family system.
    *   **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):** Focuses on accepting difficult thoughts and feelings and committing to values-based action.
*   **Implementing Interventions:** This is the ""doing"" part of therapy.  Examples:
    *   **Cognitive Restructuring (CBT):** Challenging and changing unhelpful thoughts.
    *   **Behavioral Experiments (CBT):** Testing out beliefs and behaviors in real-life situations.
    *   **Exposure Therapy (for Anxiety):**"
I feel really uncomfortable when I have people's attention.  It makes me not want to talk in public or answer questions in class. Can I get over this social anxiety?,"Since anxiety usually about anticipating a bad result, or fear of being judged negatively, as though having failed some sort of test, consider what would give you the feeling of anticipating a good result from talking to an audience?Maybe, for example, if you prepared and rehearsed your talk more than what you typically would, you'd feel more secure in speaking  in front of an audience.Once you sort through your particular reason as to the source of your discomfort, it may feel more manageable.Yes, social anxiety can change.  You may naturally prefer smaller groups than an audience.And, it is possible to decrease anxiety in what may always be somewhat uncomfortable for you.","Okay, it's incredibly common to feel uncomfortable when you're the center of attention, and it's *very* good that you're recognizing this and wanting to work on it. That discomfort is often a sign of social anxiety, and yes, absolutely, you can get over it – or at least manage it significantly! It takes work, and it's often most effective with support, but it's achievable. Let's break down how to approach this, covering understanding it, strategies you can try, and when to seek professional help.

**1. Understanding What's Happening**

* **It's Normal:** First, know you're not alone. Many people experience this. Evolutionarily, being singled out *could* have meant danger (predator attention, social exclusion), so it's a primal response.
* **What specifically makes you uncomfortable?** Try to pinpoint the *thoughts* and *feelings* you experience.  Is it:
    * **Fear of judgment:** ""They're thinking I'm stupid,"" ""They're noticing how nervous I am,"" ""I'll say something wrong.""
    * **Physical sensations:**  Racing heart, sweating, blushing, trembling, feeling like you're going to freeze up.
    * **Negative self-talk:**  ""I'm awkward,"" ""I'm boring,"" ""I always mess things up.""
    * **Fear of embarrassment:** A strong worry about doing or saying something embarrassing.
* **The Vicious Cycle:**  The anxiety creates the very behaviors you fear (stammering, blushing, etc.), which then *confirms* your negative beliefs.  (e.g., You fear you'll stammer, you get anxious and *do* stammer, and then you think, ""See, I knew I'd mess up!"")



**2. Strategies to Try (Start Small!)**

These are broken down into categories, from things you can do independently to things that are easier with a friend.  Pick one or two to start with – don’t try to overhaul everything at once.

* **Self-Help/Cognitive Techniques:**
    * **Challenge Negative Thoughts:** When you notice those negative thoughts, ask yourself:  ""Is this thought *really* true?  Is there another way to look at this?""  ""What's the worst that could *actually* happen?"" ""What's the likelihood of that worst thing happening?""  Replace the negative thought with a more realistic one.  (e.g., ""I might stumble over my words, but that doesn't mean I'm unintelligent."")
    * **Positive Self-Talk:**  Counteract the negative self-talk with positive affirmations.  (e.g., ""I am capable,"" ""I have valuable things to say,"" ""It's okay to be nervous."")
    * **Visualization:** Practice visualizing yourself successfully handling situations that make you anxious.  Imagine yourself speaking confidently in class, answering a question clearly, or making a brief presentation.
    * **Mindfulness & Breathing Exercises:**  These help calm your nervous system.  Deep, slow breathing (box breathing: inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4) can be incredibly helpful *in the moment* when you're feeling anxious.  Apps like Calm, Headspace, or Insight Timer can guide you.
* **Gradual Exposure (This is KEY):**  This is about slowly facing your fears in a controlled way.  Start with *very* small steps and work your way up.  This is the most effective long-term strategy.
    * **Step 1: Low-Pressure Situations:**
        * **Eye Contact:** Practice making brief eye contact with people (cashiers, people you pass on the street).  Start with a quick glance and gradually increase the duration.
        * **Small Talk:**  Initiate very brief conversations with people you feel comfortable with (family, close friends). ""Hi, how's your day going?""
        * **Order Food/Coffee:**  Practice ordering for yourself, making sure to look at the person taking your order.
    * **Step 2:  Slightly More Challenging:**
        * **Ask a Question in a Small Group:**  If you're in a club or small group, try asking a simple question.
        * **Contribute a Comment:** Offer a brief comment in a discussion, when you feel relatively safe.
        * **Read Aloud:** Practice reading a paragraph aloud to a friend or family member.
    * **Step 3:  Moving Towards Your Fears:**
        * **Answer a Question in Class (a simple one!):** Choose a question you know the answer to and that doesn't require a long explanation.
        * **Volunteer for"
"I've been with him for a couple months. We will talk everyday and he will get mad over something I will say and not talk to me. We have our great moments, but I just need to focus on my personal situations, and I feel he is slowing me down with that. I still wanna be with him, but not now.","I have learned that the best approach is to say that you need the time to get yourself together, mature, learn, outside of a intimate relationship but just in a friend to friend relationship...don't blame him or point fingers at him.... most likely if you did that it would not go well.  If you make it about you and that you want the best for him while you work on self, it would be taken better.  ","Okay, this is a really common and tricky situation. It sounds like you're experiencing a push-pull dynamic with this guy, and you're right to recognize it's impacting your ability to focus on *you* right now. It's good you're acknowledging that even though you have feelings for him, the timing isn't right. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering the feelings, the communication, and setting boundaries, broken down into sections:

**1. Understanding What's Happening**

* **The ""Hot & Cold"" Pattern:** His getting angry and then silent is a form of emotional manipulation, even if he doesn't realize it. It creates anxiety and keeps you seeking his approval.  It's not a healthy way to handle conflict. You're walking on eggshells, which is exhausting.
* **Your Needs Matter:** You are absolutely valid in needing space to focus on your personal situations.  That's *not* selfish. It's responsible self-care.  It's crucial for your own growth and well-being.
* **Recognizing the Slowdown:** You're right to identify that he's slowing you down.  That could mean distracting you from goals, taking up emotional energy, or making you hesitant to take steps forward in your life.
* **Wanting Him *Eventually* is Okay:**  It's fine to still have feelings. This isn't about cutting him out of your life forever, but about prioritizing yourself *first*.



**2.  The Conversation - This is the Hard Part**

This needs to be a direct, honest, and (as much as possible) calm conversation.  Here's a framework. *Choose a time when you're both relatively calm and you won't be interrupted.*  Avoid doing this over text. A phone call is okay if in-person isn't possible.

* **Start with Affirmation (but be careful):**  ""I really enjoy the time we spend together, and I care about you.""  (Don't overdo this, as it can be misinterpreted as you not being serious about needing space.)
* **State Your Needs (Focus on ""I"" Statements):** This is the core.  Here are a few options, mix and match to fit your style:
    * ""I'm going through some things personally right now that require my full attention. I need to really focus on [mention briefly what you're focusing on - work, family, self-improvement, etc.  You don't need to overshare, just give context].""
    *  ""I've realized that I need some space to work on myself and figure things out.  I'm finding it hard to do that with the current dynamic.""
    * ""I value our connection, but I’m realizing that I need to prioritize my own well-being right now.  That means needing some distance.""
* **Address the Pattern (Gently but Firmly):** *This is important, but tread carefully. He may get defensive.*
    * ""I've noticed that sometimes when we disagree, you shut down and don't talk to me for a while.  That's really difficult for me, and I need to be in a relationship where we can communicate through disagreements.""  (Don't get into a debate about *why* he does this during this conversation. Just state the impact on you.)
* **Be Clear About What You Want (The ""Pause""):** This is *crucial*.
    * ""I need to take a step back from talking every day.  I need some time to focus on myself without feeling like I'm walking on eggshells.""
    * ""I'm not saying I don't want to see you at all, but I need a break from consistent contact right now.  Maybe we can revisit things in [a month/two months/a specific timeframe], when I'm in a better headspace."" *Be realistic with the timeframe.*
    * ""I think it would be best if we didn’t talk for [timeframe]. I need to process some things and work on my own life.""
* **Reinforce Your Feelings (But Stay Strong):** ""This isn't easy for me to say, and I do care about you, but I need to do this for myself.""
* **Expect a Reaction:** He might be upset, confused, or even angry. Try to remain calm and reiterate your needs. Don't get sucked into an argument.



**3. Setting & Maintaining Boundaries**

* **Be Prepared to Enforce Your Boundaries:**  This is the hardest part. He *will* likely test them. If he starts contacting you excessively after you've asked for space, you need to:
    * **Don't respond immediately.**"
"When I get talked to by my dad or stepmom, or if I'm in trouble, I will begin to cry and not say what's wrong with me. When my dad or stepmom ask what is wrong, I never know the answers or the words to put together what is actually wrong with me.","Maybe you need more time to reflect and organize your thoughts.Try to figure out what would make you feel more relaxed about talking to your dad or stepmom.Also its possible you simply don't feel safe around either of them and so intuitively realize you're better off not talking with them about a delicate matter.Depending on whether you trust talking to dad and stepmom, you may simply wish to excuse yourself from speaking about yourself.There's no good reason to be heartfelt with people whom you don't feel are willing to accept or understand who you are.","Okay, that sounds really tough. It's incredibly common to shut down when feeling overwhelmed, especially when facing authority figures like parents or stepparents, *especially* when you feel like you're in trouble. It's also really common to struggle to articulate *why* you're upset in the moment. Here's a breakdown of why this might be happening, and a bunch of ideas for how to cope, broken down into sections.  I'll try to be thorough, but please read the disclaimer at the end.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Fight, Flight, or Freeze:** Your reaction sounds a lot like the ""freeze"" response to stress. When we feel threatened (and being scolded or feeling in trouble *can* feel threatening, even if that's not the intention), our bodies can react in a few ways: fight (become aggressive), flight (run away), or freeze (become still and shut down).  Crying is often a part of the freeze response, releasing stress hormones.
* **Difficulty with Emotional Regulation:**  It takes practice to learn how to manage big feelings.  It's possible you haven't yet developed the skills to identify and label your emotions *while* you're feeling them intensely.
* **Fear of Consequences:**  You might be afraid of making things worse if you *do* try to explain. Maybe you've been in situations where trying to explain yourself led to more trouble, or didn't feel heard.  This makes you less likely to try again.
* **Pressure to ""Perform"" Explanation:** When someone asks ""What's wrong?"" it puts pressure on you to have a neat, logical answer.  Emotions aren't always neat and logical!  Sometimes they're just a jumble of feelings.
* **Past Experiences:**  Previous interactions with your dad or stepmom may have shaped your response.  If you've felt dismissed or misunderstood in the past, you might anticipate that happening again.
* **Alexithymia (Possible, but less likely without more info):**  This is a personality trait where people have difficulty identifying and describing their emotions. It's not a disorder necessarily, but it can make things like this very challenging.  It's less likely the sole cause, but worth knowing about.



**What You Can Do *In the Moment* (When It's Happening)**

These are things to try *while* you're starting to feel overwhelmed and the tears are welling up.

* **The ""Pause"" Button:** This is the hardest, but potentially most helpful.  When you feel yourself starting to cry and shut down, *try* to consciously say (even if it's just a whisper), ""I need a minute.""  Or, ""Can we pause this for a second?""  This buys you time.
* **Deep Breaths:**  Sounds cliché, but it works. Slow, deep breaths can help calm your nervous system.  Try breathing in for 4 seconds, holding for 4 seconds, and breathing out for 6 seconds.  (Box breathing).
* **Physical Anchor:**  Holding something – a smooth stone, a stress ball, your own hands tightly – can sometimes ground you in the present moment.
* **Simple Statements:**  You don't need a full explanation. Try one of these:
    * ""I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now.""
    * ""I'm having a hard time explaining.""
    * ""I need a moment to think.""
    * ""I'm upset, but I need a minute to figure out why.""
* **Write It Down (If Possible):** If you can, quickly jot down a few words about what's bothering you.  Even just keywords can help you organize your thoughts later. (Keep a small notebook handy).
* **Ask for Time, Specifically:**  ""Can I have 10 minutes to collect my thoughts and then come back and talk?""
* **Non-Verbal Communication:** If you really can't speak, *try* to nod or shake your head to answer simple questions (""Are you sad?"" ""Are you frustrated?"").



**What You Can Do *Outside* of Those Moments (Preparation)**

These are things to work on when you're calm to make it easier to cope later.

* **Emotional Vocabulary:**  Start paying attention to your feelings throughout the day.  Instead of just saying ""I feel bad,"" try to be more specific:  ""I feel frustrated,"" ""I feel disappointed,"" ""I feel anxious,"" ""I feel embarrassed,"" ""I feel hurt.""  There are emotion wheels online that can help with this (search ""emotion wheel"").
* **Journaling:**  Regularly writing down your thoughts and feelings, even just for 5-10 minutes a day, can help you become more"
"I've been bullied for years and the teachers have done nothing about it. I haven't been diagnosed with depression, but i have been extremely sad for years.

How can I deal with being bullied at school when the teachers won't help?","To be bullied is very painful.I'm glad you know the bullies are doing the wrong thing and whatever they are telling you is pure meanness.Depending on how independent you feel, why not tell either your classroom teacher or schedule an appointment with the vice principal?Bullying other students is taken very seriously in some states and schools are expected to address the bullying until the victimized student feels safe.If you hesitate to do this on your own, then would you ask either of your parents or even a friend of yours who is also in the school, to report the problem?In case you are afraid the bullies will retaliate for reporting them, then tell this to whatever school authority you decide to ask for help.You're entitled to be protected by your school.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and I'm so sorry you've been going through this for years. It's completely understandable that you're feeling incredibly sad, even without a formal diagnosis. It takes a huge toll on a person to be consistently bullied, especially when those who should be protecting you aren't stepping in. Here's a breakdown of how to deal with this, covering immediate safety, building your resilience, and finding support.  I'll try to be thorough, but please read the disclaimer at the end, as this isn't a substitute for professional help.

**1. Prioritize Your Safety - Immediate Steps**

*   **Avoidance (When Possible):** This isn't a *solution*, but it's a survival tactic. If you can safely avoid the bully (different routes to class, different lunchtimes, staying near friends), do so.  Don't feel ashamed for protecting yourself.
*   **Buddy System:**  The most powerful thing you can do *right now* is to stick with friends. Walk with them between classes, eat lunch with them, and try not to be alone in hallways or areas where the bullying happens.  Even just having someone *nearby* can deter a bully.
*   **Grey Rock Method:** This is a technique to make yourself a less appealing target.  When the bully engages, respond with boring, unenthusiastic answers.  Don't show emotion.  Think short, factual statements.  Examples:
    *   Bully: ""What are you wearing?""  You: ""Clothes.""
    *   Bully: ""You're so weird."" You: ""Okay.""
    *   The goal is to be so unrewarding that they lose interest.  It's *hard* to do, but it can work.
*   **Document Everything:**  This is crucial, even if it feels pointless. Keep a detailed log of every incident. Include:
    *   Date and Time
    *   Location
    *   What happened (be specific)
    *   Who was involved (bullies and any witnesses)
    *   What you did/said
    *   How it made you feel.
    This log will be important if you escalate things (see section 3).  Save any evidence like screenshots of online bullying.
* **Don't Retaliate:** I know it's incredibly tempting, but fighting back usually makes things worse. It can get *you* in trouble, and it gives the bully the reaction they want.



**2. Building Your Resilience & Self-Worth**

This is about strengthening yourself *internally* because you can't rely on external help right now.

*   **Focus on Your Strengths:** What are you good at? What do you enjoy?  Dedicate time to those things.  This isn't about becoming perfect; it's about reminding yourself that you have value and things you enjoy.
*   **Self-Care:** This isn't about bubble baths (though those are nice if you like them!). It's about intentionally doing things that help you feel better.  Examples:
    *   **Physical Activity:** Exercise releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects.  Even a walk can help.
    *   **Healthy Eating:**  Fuel your body well.
    *   **Sleep:**  Get enough rest.  It's harder to cope when you're exhausted.
    *   **Mindfulness/Relaxation:**  Deep breathing exercises, meditation (there are apps for this!), or simply spending time in nature can help calm your mind.
*   **Positive Self-Talk:**  This is really hard when you're feeling down, but try to challenge negative thoughts.  When you catch yourself thinking something like ""I'm worthless,"" try to reframe it.  ""I'm having a hard time right now, but I have strengths and qualities that matter.""
* **Limit Social Media:** If the bullying extends to online platforms, consider limiting your time on social media or blocking the bully.
*   **Find Your Tribe:**  Connect with people who accept you for who you are. This could be through clubs, sports, hobbies, or online communities.  Having supportive relationships is vital.



**3. Escalating the Situation (Despite Teacher Inaction)**

Since teachers haven't helped, you need to go higher up.  This is where your documentation becomes crucial.

*   **School Counselor:**  Even if you've talked to them before, try again.  Sometimes counselors can advocate for you in ways teachers can't. Bring your documentation.
*   **Assistant Principal/Vice Principal:**  Schedule a meeting.  Again, bring your documentation.  Be clear and assertive about what's happening and how it's affecting you."
"Sometimes, when I look at my pet cat, I think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him. It makes me sad because I love him, but I always think about how helpless he is. There've even been split-seconds where I felt almost tempted to kick him, followed by shame and guilt.","A lot of different things could be happening here. Do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is? If you have not actually kicked him, then I would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt, since you did not hurt him. What else is there?It would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you. It could be that you feel safe with your cat, so strong emotions come up because you feel safe.","Okay, this is a really important thing you're sharing, and it's good you're acknowledging these feelings. It takes courage to admit to something like that, especially the part about the fleeting thought of harming your cat. It's *very* common to experience intrusive thoughts, and it's crucial to understand what's happening here. Let's break down what you've described, and then I'll offer some suggestions for how to cope.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Intrusive Thoughts:** The sudden, unwanted thought of kicking your cat is almost certainly an *intrusive thought*. These are thoughts that pop into your head seemingly out of nowhere, and they're often disturbing or upsetting. They *don't* reflect your character or your actual desires.  The fact that you immediately feel shame and guilt is a *strong* indicator that this is an intrusive thought, and not a genuine impulse.  People who genuinely want to harm something don't usually feel that level of distress afterward.
* **Emotional Sensitivity & Empathy:** You clearly have a lot of love and empathy for your cat. Your concern for his vulnerability is a sign of a kind heart.  This sensitivity can actually *increase* the intensity of intrusive thoughts. You're hyper-aware of the potential for harm, which can manifest as imagining causing it, even though you'd never act on it.
* **Anxiety & Control:**  Sometimes intrusive thoughts are linked to underlying anxiety. The feeling of helplessness you associate with your cat, combined with your own worries, can contribute to these unwanted thoughts.  They can also be a way your brain tries to 'test' your boundaries – seeing how you react to a disturbing thought.
* **The Cycle of Thought, Feeling, and Behavior:** You've described this perfectly. Thought (the intrusive thought) -> Feeling (shame, guilt, sadness) -> Behavior (actively rejecting the thought and feeling bad about having it).  This cycle can become exhausting and reinforce the anxiety.
* **The Paradox of Love:** Loving something deeply can sometimes bring with it a fear of losing it or of being responsible for its harm.  This can create a strange, uncomfortable tension.



**Why It's Important to Address This**

Even though you haven't acted on these thoughts, and likely never will, they're still causing you distress.  Left unaddressed, intrusive thoughts can:

* **Increase Anxiety:** The more you try to suppress them, the stronger they can become.
* **Impact Your Self-Esteem:**  You might start to question your own goodness or sanity.
* **Strain Your Relationship with Your Cat:**  Even subconsciously, the anxiety could affect how you interact with him.

**What You Can Do**

Here's a breakdown of strategies, starting with things you can do on your own, and then suggesting when to seek professional help:

**1. Self-Help Techniques:**

* **Acceptance & Observation (Don't Fight the Thought):** This is *key*.  Instead of trying to push the thought away (which often makes it stronger), acknowledge it: ""Okay, I'm having the thought that I could hurt my cat.""  Then, observe it without judgment.  Notice it's just a thought, not a command.  Don't analyze it, don't engage with it, just let it be there.  Think of it like a cloud passing in the sky.
* **Label It as an Intrusive Thought:**  Specifically saying to yourself, ""This is an intrusive thought, and it doesn't reflect my true feelings"" can be incredibly helpful.
* **Thought Defusion:**  Techniques to create distance from your thoughts.  For example:
    * **Say it Silly:** Mentally repeat the thought in a cartoonish voice.
    * **Thank Your Brain:**  ""Thanks, brain, for trying to scare me with that thought."" (This can sound ridiculous, and that's the point!)
* **Grounding Techniques:** When you're feeling anxious or overwhelmed by the thought, bring yourself back to the present moment.  Try:
    * **5-4-3-2-1:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system.
* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself.  You're experiencing something difficult, and it's okay to feel distressed.  Treat yourself with the same compassion you would offer a friend.
* **Focus on Your Positive Feelings:**  Deliberately spend time focusing on your love for your cat.  Play with him, cuddle him, and remind yourself of all the reasons"
"I just lost my grandpa and i'm having a rough time with it.    I need some help to deal with the loss, but I don’t think I can pay for counseling. Where Can I get help?","If you connect with your therapist and can say whatever you want to say and not be judged. If you feel like things, situations, your outlook are shifting for you.","Okay, I am so incredibly sorry for your loss. Losing a grandpa is a uniquely painful experience, and it's completely understandable that you're having a rough time. It's also very responsible of you to recognize you need support. And it's smart to think about financial constraints – it's okay to need help *without* being able to pay for it. Here's a breakdown of resources available to you, categorized for ease of use. I'll include a lot, because what works for one person doesn't work for another.  I'll also add notes about what each resource is generally good for.

**I. Immediate Support - Crisis & Emotional Lines (Available 24/7)**

These are good for when you feel overwhelmed *right now* and need to talk to someone immediately.  They are confidential and free.

*   **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Dial or text 988. This is now the main national crisis line.  They can help with grief, suicidal thoughts, or just overwhelming emotional distress.  They will listen and offer support. [https://988lifeline.org/](https://988lifeline.org/)
*   **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741.  This is a text-based service. Good if you prefer to communicate by text.
*   **The Grief Support Network:** 1-888-939-9399.  Specifically geared towards grief support. [https://www.griefsupportnetwork.org/](https://www.griefsupportnetwork.org/)
*   **SAMHSA’s National Helpline:** 1-800-662-HELP (4357). Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.  While focused on substance abuse, they can also provide referrals to mental health resources. [https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline](https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline)

**II. Free or Low-Cost Counseling & Support Groups**

These options offer more ongoing support than crisis lines, but often have limited availability or require some effort to find.

*   **Local County Mental Health Services:**  Search online for ""[Your County] mental health services"" or ""[Your State] mental health services.""  Most counties have departments that offer low-cost or sliding scale (fees based on income) counseling. This is often the *best* option for affordable, ongoing care.
*   **Community Mental Health Centers:** Similar to county services, these centers provide affordable mental health care.  Search online for ""community mental health center near me."" [https://www.findtreatment.samhsa.gov/](https://www.findtreatment.samhsa.gov/) is a good starting point.
*   **Universities and Colleges:** Many universities with psychology or counseling programs offer low-cost therapy services provided by graduate students under the supervision of licensed professionals.  Look at universities near you and search for ""university counseling center"" or ""psychology clinic.""
*   **Non-Profit Organizations:** Many non-profits offer grief support groups or individual counseling.  Here are a few national ones:
    *   **The Compassionate Friends:**  Specifically for grieving parents, siblings, and grandparents.  They have support groups nationwide. [https://www.compassionatefriends.org/](https://www.compassionatefriends.org/) (This one is *very* relevant to your situation.)
    *   **GriefShare:** A network of grief support groups, often held at churches. [https://www.griefshare.org/](https://www.griefshare.org/)
    *   **National Alliance for Children's Grief (NACG):** While focused on children, they also have resources for adults grieving the loss of a loved one. [https://childrengrieve.org/](https://childrengrieve.org/)
*   **Open Path Collective:**  This is a network of therapists who offer significantly reduced rates (typically $30-$80 per session) to clients who qualify.  There's a one-time membership fee, but it can be very worthwhile. [https://openpathcollective.org/](https://openpathcollective.org/)
*   **Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs):** If you or a family member are employed, check if your employer offers an EAP. These programs often provide a limited number of free counseling sessions.
* **Modern Loss:** Offers free online resources, including articles, webinars, and a community forum. [https://www.modernloss.com/](https://www.modernloss.com/)

**III. Online Resources & Self-Help**

These are good for supplementing"
"When I see something I don’t like, I go off like a ticking time bomb. I go from “0 to 100” really quickly.","Sometimes we react to situations immediately, without thinking of the consequences of our actions. Typically by not reacting right away, we are better able to gather our thoughts, see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives, and respond more calmly. One of the strategies that almost always helps is deep breathing. When faced with a stressful situation, you can give yourself a time out by removing yourself from the stress and spend 5 minutes taking deep breaths (breathe in slowly counting to 4 and breathe out even slower counting to 6), while focusing and thinking only about your breathing. After doing so, think of the various ways you can respond to the situation and choose the one most appropriate. Good luck!","Okay, it sounds like you're recognizing a pattern of really intense, fast-escalating emotional reactions when you encounter something you dislike. That's really good self-awareness! Calling it ""going off like a ticking time bomb"" and ""0 to 100"" paints a very vivid picture.  It suggests you experience a *very* rapid shift from calm (or relatively calm) to a highly reactive state. 

Let's break down what might be happening and explore some things that could help.  I'll try to be thorough, but remember I'm an AI and can't offer therapy. This is for informational purposes only, and if this is significantly impacting your life, *please* consider seeking professional help (I'll add resources at the end).

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Emotional Regulation:** What you're describing is a difficulty with emotional regulation.  Emotional regulation is the ability to manage and respond to emotional experiences in a healthy way. It doesn’t mean *not* feeling emotions, it means not being *overwhelmed* by them.
* **Triggers:**  Something specific is acting as a ""trigger."" This could be a situation, a comment, a memory, a feeling, a thought, or even a physical sensation.  Your brain perceives this trigger as a threat, even if it's not a truly dangerous situation.
* **Physiological Response:**  When you're triggered, your body likely goes into ""fight, flight, or freeze"" mode. This is a natural survival mechanism, but it's happening in situations where it's not necessary.  Physically, this looks like:
    * **Increased heart rate**
    * **Rapid breathing**
    * **Muscle tension**
    * **Adrenaline rush**
    * **Sweating**
* **Cognitive Response:**  Your thoughts probably race, and you may have difficulty thinking clearly.  You might jump to negative conclusions or interpret things in a highly critical way.  This can involve things like:
    * **Catastrophizing:**  Thinking the worst possible outcome will happen.
    * **All-or-nothing thinking:** Seeing things in black and white, with no shades of grey.
    * **Personalization:**  Taking things personally that aren't necessarily about you.
* **Behavioral Response:** This is the ""explosion"" – the reaction you describe. It could manifest as:
    * **Yelling or shouting**
    * **Aggressive behavior (verbal or physical)**
    * **Withdrawal and shutting down**
    * **Intense arguing**
    * **Emotional outbursts (crying, etc.)**



**Why Does This Happen? (Potential Underlying Factors)**

There are many reasons why someone might react this way. Here are a few possibilities:

* **Past Trauma:**  Experiences of trauma (even seemingly ""small"" traumas) can make the nervous system hyper-sensitive to perceived threats.
* **Childhood Experiences:**  How you learned to deal with emotions as a child plays a huge role.  If you grew up in an environment where emotions were suppressed, invalidated, or reacted to with anger, you may have developed this pattern.
* **Anxiety:**  Generalized anxiety or other anxiety disorders can make you more prone to overreacting.
* **Depression:**  Depression can sometimes manifest as irritability and increased reactivity.
* **Personality Traits:**  Some personality traits, like high sensitivity, can make you more easily overwhelmed.
* **Stress:** High levels of ongoing stress can deplete your emotional resources and make it harder to cope with challenges.
* **Underlying Mental Health Conditions:** Conditions like Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) or Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) can involve difficulties with emotional regulation, but *do not self-diagnose.* This is just a possibility to discuss with a professional.




**What Can You Do About It? (Strategies)**

Okay, this is the important part! Here's a breakdown of things to try, moving from immediate coping to longer-term strategies:

**1. In the Moment (When You Feel It Starting)**

* **Recognize the Signs:**  This is huge. You've already started! Pay attention to *what happens in your body* before you ""explode.""  Is your jaw clenching? Is your heart racing? Are your hands getting sweaty? Recognizing these early warning signs is the first step.
* **Deep Breathing:**  Simple, but effective.  Try box breathing: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds. Repeat several times.  This helps activate the parasympathetic nervous system (the ""calm down"" system).
* **Grounding Techniques:** Bring yourself back to the present moment.  
    * **5-4"
I need to speak to someone about sexual addiction and binge eating immediately.,There are plenty of online providers within the mental health field that would me more than happy to speak with you immediately.  Many of them provide treatment on a sliding scale fee.  I would google online mental health treatment providers and that should lead you to a list of providers that can help you. ,"Okay, you're incredibly brave for reaching out, and it's good you recognize you need support.  It's really important to connect with someone *right now* given you say ""immediately.""  Here are several options, with different levels of immediacy and approaches.  I'm including a lot because what feels right for *you* in this moment is what matters most.  I'll break it down into crisis lines (for right now), warmlines (for immediate support but not necessarily crisis level), and resources for ongoing help.  **Please read through the whole list, even if you initially think one sounds best. Sometimes, knowing all your options is helpful.**

**I. IMMEDIATE CRISIS SUPPORT (If you are feeling overwhelmed, in danger of harming yourself or others, or are actively struggling with intense urges):**

*   **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:**  Call or text 988 in the US and Canada. In the UK, you can call 111. This is available 24/7, free, and confidential.  They can provide immediate support and connect you with local resources.  *Even if you're not suicidal, they can help with overwhelming emotional distress.*  https://988lifeline.org/
*   **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741.  This is also 24/7, free, and confidential.  It's a good option if you prefer texting to calling. https://www.crisistextline.org/
*   **The Trevor Project:** If you are LGBTQ and in crisis, call 1-866-488-7386 or text START to 678-678. https://www.thetrevorproject.org/
*   **Emergency Room:** If you feel unsafe, go to your nearest emergency room.  They can provide immediate medical and psychiatric care.
*   **Sexual Assault Hotline:** Even if your struggles aren't about assault, they are trained to handle crisis situations and can offer support. RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) is available at 1-800-656-HOPE.  https://www.rainn.org  (You can also get help online via their website.)



**II. IMMEDIATE SUPPORT / WARMLINES (For support right now, but not necessarily a crisis.  These are good if you need to talk things through):**

*   **SAA National Helpline (Sex Addicts Anonymous):** 1-800-579-SANE (7263).  This line is answered by members of SAA and can provide immediate peer support.  https://saa-recovery.org/
*   **SLAA (Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous) Helpline:** 1-866-922-7522. Similar to SAA, offering peer support. https://slaafws.org/
*   **The National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) Helpline:** 1-800-931-2237. They can provide support, resources, and referrals for binge eating.  https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/  (Also has a text option: text ""NEDA"" to 741741)
*   **SAMHSA National Helpline:** 1-800-662-HELP (4357). This is a confidential, free, 24/7 information service, in English and Spanish, providing referrals to local treatment facilities, support groups, and community-based organizations. https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline

**III. RESOURCES FOR ONGOING HELP (These are things to explore after you've gotten some immediate support, but are vital for recovery):**

*   **Therapists:**  Finding a therapist specializing in both sexual addiction *and* eating disorders is ideal, but can be difficult.  You might need to work with two different therapists.
    *   **Psychology Today:**  https://www.psychologytoday.com/us  (You can search for therapists by specialty, insurance, and location.)  Look for keywords like ""sexual addiction,"" ""compulsive sexual behavior,"" ""eating disorders,"" ""binge eating disorder,"" ""trauma-informed care"" (trauma is often a factor in both).
    *   **GoodTherapy.org:** https://www.goodtherapy.org/  (Similar to Psychology Today)
*   **Sex Addicts Anonymous (SAA):** https://saa-recovery.org/  (12-step program)
*   **Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous (SLAA):** https://slaafws.org/ ("
"He's been losing feelings and he doesn't know why. I love him very very much. He sometimes thinks I'm obsessed when I'm not at all. I give him his space and I make sure he's okay but sometimes I think if me and him saw each other more it would be better? I truly want me and him to get better, it's kind of hard not to stress about it, because the love of my life is losing feelings which is a sad feeling. He's a great guy! I just don't know why he's been losing feelings towards me. He's starting to put less effort in talking to me. At this point I'll do anything to just make us better as a couple. I tried talking to him but he doesn't like talking about it much. Advice on what to do?","I'm willing to bet that this isn't what you are hoping to hear, but I'd suggest giving him space. Ooph, that's a tough one, right?! I know. But here's the thing, when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away. He needs to feel like a solid and whole person (as you do too) to be able to be fully in your relationship. It's the work of being in relationship to learn this. I get that this is tough stuff. I wonder, outside of being with him, how do you soothe and calm yourself? That's the stuff for you to tune into and focus on right now.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's completely understandable why you're so stressed and heartbroken. It's agonizing to feel someone you love drifting away, especially when you don't understand why. Here's a breakdown of advice, trying to cover a lot of angles, and acknowledging the difficulties you're already facing.  I'll break it down into sections: Understanding the Situation, What You Can Do (Directly), What You Can Do (For Yourself), and When to Consider Bigger Steps.

**1. Understanding the Situation (As Much as Possible)**

* **""Losing feelings"" is vague:**  It doesn't mean the love is *gone*, but it suggests a shift.  It could be a loss of *romantic* feeling, a feeling of disconnection, stress impacting his emotional capacity, or something else entirely.  The vagueness is what makes it so scary.
* **The ""Obsessed"" Perception:** This is crucial.  Even if you *feel* like you're giving space, your anxiety might be leaking out in ways you don't realize.  Frequent check-ins (""Are you okay?"") can sometimes *feel* controlling, even with good intentions, especially to someone who needs a lot of independence. It’s also possible he’s misinterpreting your care as neediness, especially if he’s already feeling distant.
* **His Avoidance of Talking:**  This is a red flag, but not necessarily a fatal one. It could mean:
    * He genuinely doesn't know *why* he's feeling this way and is afraid of saying the wrong thing.
    * He's afraid of hurting you.
    * He's dealing with something personal he's not ready to share (work stress, family issues, internal struggles).
    * He's checked out and doesn't want to invest the emotional energy in trying to fix things. (This is the hardest possibility to face).
* **Effort & Communication are Key:** A decline in effort in communication is a significant sign of a relationship struggling.  It suggests a distancing happening on his end.



**2. What You Can Do (Directly - With Caution)**

* **One More Direct, Calm Conversation (Focus on *Your* Feelings):**  Instead of asking ""Why are you losing feelings?"" (which puts him on the defensive), try:  ""I've noticed we haven't been connecting as much lately, and I'm feeling worried and sad about it.  I miss feeling close to you.  I want to understand what's going on, not to fix it, but just to understand *how you're feeling*.""  **Key:** Use ""I"" statements, focus on your experience, and *actively listen* without interrupting.  Be prepared for him to still shut down, but you need to make one more clear attempt to open the door.
* **Specifically Address the ""Obsessed"" Concern:**  ""I've been thinking about how I come across, and I'm worried I might be inadvertently making you feel like I'm being overly attentive.  That's absolutely not my intention. I truly want to respect your space and independence.  Can you help me understand if there's anything I'm doing that feels that way?"" (This shows self-awareness and a willingness to adjust).
* **Small, Intentional Gestures (Without Expectation):**  Instead of grand gestures, focus on *small* things that show you care, without requiring a response.  Leave him a little note, make his favorite coffee, send a funny meme *occasionally* - things that are low-pressure and demonstrate you're thinking of him. *Don't* do these hoping for a specific reaction.
* **Suggest a Neutral Activity:** Propose something fun and low-pressure that you both enjoy, but isn’t a “relationship talk” activity.  A movie, a walk, a game night.  The goal is to simply spend time together in a positive way.
* **Respect his need for space… but set a boundary:** If he truly needs space, respect it. But you're allowed to say, ""I respect your space, but I also need some level of connection.  Can we agree to [e.g., a short check-in text each day, one date night a week]?""  This shows you're not just disappearing and waiting.




**3. What You Can Do (For Yourself - This is VITAL)**

* **Distraction and Self-Care:** This is not about ignoring the problem; it's about surviving it.  Focus on *your* life.  Hobbies, friends, family, work, exercise, anything that brings you joy and fulfillment.  This will also make you a more balanced and attractive partner (even if he doesn't"
"I believe my partner has a masturbation and porn problem. He masturbates daily, even when I am lying in bed sleeping beside him. We have sex once a week. He is rough and worries about his needs. He never touches me, and treats me like a porn star, wanting to finish on my face or chest.","It sounds like your in quite a rough place, my recommendation just based on what you type might warrant a visit to a psychotherapist to resolve what may be going on, I am not entirely sure but it sounds like he might have a bit of a sex addiction problem. One thing you need to ask yourself is ""Am I happy?"", ""Do I feel loved?"", these are deep questions, but the answers to those questions will give you a direction to travel in. ","Okay, this sounds incredibly painful and invalidating, and you're right to be concerned and to seek support. It's clear this is impacting your emotional and physical intimacy, and it's deeply affecting your sense of self-worth and connection with your partner.  Here's a breakdown of what's going on, what might be happening, and how to approach it, broken down into sections.  Please read the **Important Disclaimer** at the end, as this is a complex issue and professional help is strongly recommended.

**1. Understanding the Situation**

* **Problematic Pornography Use & Compulsive Behavior:** Daily masturbation *in itself* isn't necessarily a ""problem"" if it's not causing distress or interfering with life. *However*, the context you've provided – doing it while you're sleeping, the impact on your sex life, and the specific requests – strongly suggests it *has* become problematic and potentially compulsive.  It's likely acting as a coping mechanism for something, or has become a deeply ingrained habit.
* **Disconnection & Lack of Intimacy:** The fact that he only initiates sex once a week, and that it's rough and focused on *his* needs, is a major red flag.  The lack of affectionate touch outside of sex is particularly concerning.  Intimacy is built on connection, vulnerability, and mutual care, and those elements seem to be absent.
* **Objectification & Dehumanization:**  His treating you ""like a porn star"" and wanting to use your body in specific, impersonal ways (finishing on your face/chest *without your enthusiastic consent*) is deeply disrespectful and objectifying. This suggests he's not seeing you as a whole person with feelings and desires, but rather as an object for his gratification. **This is not okay.**  This behavior can be emotionally damaging.
* **Potential Power Imbalance:**  The dynamic you describe suggests a power imbalance in the relationship. He is prioritizing his own needs and desires without regard for your feelings or boundaries.
* **Possible Underlying Issues:**  Compulsive sexual behavior can sometimes be linked to anxiety, depression, trauma, or other mental health concerns. It’s not an excuse for his behavior, but it can be a contributing factor.



**2. What's Likely Happening (Possible Explanations, Not Excuses)**

* **Pornography Rewiring:**  Frequent pornography use can change brain chemistry and create unrealistic expectations about sex. It can desensitize someone to real-life intimacy and lead to a preference for the intense stimulation and control offered by porn.
* **Emotional Avoidance:**  Masturbation and porn could be a way for him to avoid dealing with difficult emotions, stress, or problems in the relationship.
* **Control & Escape:**  The act of masturbation and viewing porn can provide a sense of control and escape from the pressures of daily life.
* **Lack of Communication Skills:** He may not know *how* to express his needs and desires in a healthy and respectful way.  This doesn't excuse the behavior, but it could be a factor.
* **Underlying Sexual Issues:**  There may be underlying issues related to sexual shame, guilt, or performance anxiety that are contributing to the behavior.




**3. What You Can Do (Steps to Take)**

* **Prioritize Your Safety & Well-being:**  This is the most important thing.  If you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, remove yourself from the situation.  Don't feel obligated to participate in any sexual activity you don't want to.
* **Choose a Calm Time to Talk:**  Don't ambush him. Pick a time when you both are relatively relaxed and not distracted.
* **Use ""I"" Statements:** Focus on how *you* feel, rather than accusing him. For example:
    * Instead of: ""You're always masturbating and ignoring me!""
    * Try: ""I feel hurt and disconnected when I notice you masturbating while I'm in bed next to you. It makes me feel like you're not interested in intimacy with me.""
    * Instead of: ""You treat me like a porn star.""
    * Try: ""I feel objectified and used when you only seem interested in me for certain sexual acts.  I need to feel desired as a whole person.""
* **Be Specific About Your Boundaries:**  Clearly state what you are and are not comfortable with.  For example: ""I am not comfortable with you finishing on my face or chest. It makes me feel disrespected.""  ""I need more non-sexual affection, like cuddling and holding hands.""
* **Express Your Need for Connection:**  Tell him you want to feel closer to him emotionally and physically.  Talk about what intimacy means to you.

"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","Please feel free to cry during therapy if you suddenly feel painful emotions arising when you describe some of your unsatisfying and unfulfilling relationships and situations.Crying when realizing the emotional hurt and unfairness between you and someone, clears you for new ways of handling interactions.As a therapist, I always have a box of tissues on the table next to the couch where people who utilize my therapy, sit.I hope you will soon discover that once your tears unlock your awareness of harmful relationships in your life, you will quickly see the freedom to establish new and happier patterns of relating.Have a good therapy!","Okay, it's *completely* normal to be freaking out before starting therapy, and it's *especially* normal to be worried about crying! Seriously, you are SO not alone in this fear. Let's break it down and talk about why it's okay, why it happens, and why it's absolutely not something to be deeply embarrassed about.

**First, let's normalize crying in therapy:**

* **Therapy is a safe space to feel.** That's literally the point! It's designed to be a place where you can let down your guard and explore difficult emotions *without* judgment. Crying is a natural emotional release. If something is bringing up strong feelings, your body is responding appropriately.  It's a sign you're *doing the work*.
* **Most therapists are prepared for tears.** They've seen it all.  They have tissues. They know how to navigate emotional responses. They won't think you're ""weak"" or ""overreacting.""  In fact, they'll likely see it as a positive sign that you're connecting with your emotions.
* **It's not about ""embarrassment"" for your therapist.**  A good therapist isn't sitting there judging you. They're focused on understanding *why* you're crying, and helping you process those feelings.  Their job isn't to assess your composure, it's to support your process.
* **Many people *do* cry in therapy.** It's incredibly common, especially in early sessions as you start to open up.  You're not an outlier, you're part of the majority.



**Why you might be worried about crying (and why those worries aren't necessarily true):**

* **Fear of vulnerability:**  Crying feels vulnerable. You might worry about appearing weak or losing control.  That's okay to acknowledge!  But remember, vulnerability is *strength*.  It takes courage to show your true self.
* **Past experiences:**  Maybe you were taught as a child that crying was ""bad"" or that you needed to be ""strong.""  Therapy can help you unpack those messages and challenge them.
* **Fear of being judged:**  You might worry your therapist will think you're dramatic or that your problems aren't ""serious enough"" to warrant tears. (Again, a good therapist won’t.)
* **Worry about not being able to stop:**  Sometimes once you start, you feel like you can't control it. Therapists are equipped to help you manage that. They can offer grounding techniques or just sit with you while you cry.

**What can you do to prepare (and feel more comfortable)?**

* **Acknowledge your fear:**  You've already done this!  Just recognizing your anxiety about crying is a good first step.
* **Remind yourself *why* you're going to therapy:**  You're going because you want to improve your well-being.  Crying can be a part of that process.
* **It's okay to say ""I'm worried I'll cry.""**  Seriously.  Tell your therapist upfront.  They'll appreciate your honesty and it can help them understand your anxiety.  You can say something like, ""I'm a little nervous about this, and I tend to get emotional. I'm worried about crying and feeling embarrassed.""
* **Have tissues handy:**  Practical, but helpful!  Most offices will have them, but having your own can feel more comforting.
* **Practice self-compassion:**  Be kind to yourself.  Allow yourself to feel whatever you're feeling without judgment.
* **Grounding techniques:**  Learn a few simple grounding techniques *before* your appointment. These can help you feel more present and manage overwhelming emotions. Some examples:
    * **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Deep breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can help calm your nervous system.
    * **Focus on your feet:**  Feel your feet on the ground. Notice the sensations.

**What if you *do* cry during your session?**

* **It's okay.**  Seriously.  Let it happen.
* **Your therapist will likely just offer support.**  They might hand you a tissue, offer a kind word, or simply sit in silence with you.
* **They might ask you what's coming up for you.** This isn't to interrogate you, but to help you understand your emotions.
* **You can always ask for a moment to compose yourself.**  It's perfectly acceptable to say"
How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,This is a tough decision to make for anyone that has ever been involved in a relationship.  My advice is for you to consider what is making you unhappy in this relationship.  Sometimes we think we are ready to move on but don't know the reason why and then we regret it.  The worst thing you want after the fact is to have regret.  Take time to do some soul searching and imagine your life without this person before you make any decisions.  This will also help you understand what it is you are looking for in a romantic relationship. Best of luck in your love life. Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling,"Okay, this is a big one. Deciding whether to end a relationship is incredibly difficult, and it's good you're taking the time to really think it through. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, broken down into sections.  It's long, but thorough - this deserves a thorough exploration!  I'll cover self-reflection, looking at the relationship, considering options, and then making a decision.  I'll also include some things to consider *before* you have ""the talk"" if you decide to end things.

**I. Self-Reflection: What Do *You* Need?**

Before you even dive into the specifics of the relationship, you need to get clear on your own needs, wants, and boundaries.

*   **Your Happiness:**  Are you generally happy when you're *with* him?  Not just in bursts, but consistently?  Or do you find yourself frequently drained, anxious, or feeling like you're walking on eggshells?
*   **Your Values:**  Do your core values align? (Think about things like family, honesty, ambition, spirituality, lifestyle).  Significant value clashes are hard to overcome.
*   **Your Future:**  What do you envision for your future? Does he fit into that vision?  Not just in terms of shared goals, but also in terms of the *way* you want to live your life.
*   **Your Needs Being Met:**  What are your emotional, physical, intellectual, and social needs? Are they being met in this relationship?  Be specific.  (e.g., ""I need regular affection,"" ""I need intellectual stimulation,"" ""I need space to pursue my hobbies"").
*   **Your Boundaries:** Have your boundaries been respected? If you've communicated your limits, has he honored them?  Repeated boundary violations are a major red flag.
*   **Are you staying because of fear?** Fear of being alone, fear of hurting him, fear of the unknown, fear of judgment from others? Identifying these fears is crucial.
*   **What would your life look like without him?**  Really visualize it. Does that feel scary, but also… maybe a little bit freeing? Or does it feel utterly devastating?



**II.  Evaluating the Relationship: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly**

Now, let's get specific about the relationship itself.  Be brutally honest with yourself.  It helps to write this down.

*   **The Good:** What do you love about him? What are the things you'll miss?  What positive impact has he had on your life?  Don't minimize these – they're important to acknowledge.
*   **The Bad:** What are the consistent issues?  (Communication problems, trust issues, different expectations, lack of support, controlling behavior, etc.).  List them out.  How long have these issues been going on?  Have they been addressed?
*   **The Ugly:**  This is the stuff that really makes you uncomfortable.  Are there any forms of abuse (emotional, verbal, physical, financial)?  Are there any behaviors that are fundamentally unacceptable to you?  Dealbreakers.
*   **Communication:** How do you communicate with each other?  Is it open, honest, and respectful? Or is it filled with defensiveness, criticism, stonewalling, or passive-aggression?
*   **Effort:**  Is there mutual effort being put into the relationship?  Is it a 50/50 split, or are you doing most of the work?
*   **Growth:**  Do you feel like you're growing as a person *within* this relationship?  Or do you feel stifled or held back?
*   **Trust:**  Is there complete trust?  Has trust been broken? If so, has it been genuinely repaired?
* **Conflict Resolution:** How do you handle disagreements? Do you resolve them constructively, or do they escalate into arguments?  Is there a pattern to your fights?
*   **Shared Interests & Quality Time:** Do you enjoy spending time together? Do you have shared interests? Do you make time for each other amidst busy lives?



**III. Have You Tried to Fix Things?**

Before making a final decision, consider if you've genuinely tried to improve the situation.

*   **Communication:** Have you clearly and calmly communicated your concerns to him?  Using ""I"" statements (e.g., ""I feel hurt when..."") instead of ""you"" statements (e.g., ""You always..."") is key.
*   **Compromise:** Are you both willing to compromise?  Relationships require give and take.
*   **Counseling/Therapy:**  Have you considered couples counseling?  A neutral third party can help you identify patterns and develop healthier communication skills"
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","The short answer is: absolutely not! The longer answer is that it might take some time to process all of the issues, and it may feel quite ""muddy"" in the issues for a lot longer than is tolerable (which is why counseling may have been postponed to begin with for you.) It's important to be realistic when entering counseling of any sort, and that the therapist be realistic with you about what you might be able to expect working with that person (I use the words ""might be able to expect"" because therapy experiences can vary.) But that not having counseling about trauma that you have experienced much earlier in your life can play a significant role in the process and how long that process could take to unpack all that may have been buried over time.It might also be helpful in counseling to work with the therapist on figuring out where to begin, but to also manage the feelings of being overwhelmed that may make it hard to continue to show up and do the work required, week in and week out. It isn't easy work trying to process past pain that you experienced, and so consistent practice of self-care, including leaning on support systems outside of therapy, is key.","Okay, wow. That *is* a lot. And it's incredibly brave of you to even acknowledge all of this, and to ask the question about starting counseling. You've carried a *huge* weight for a long time, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed just thinking about unpacking it.

Let me be very clear: **You absolutely do *not* have too many issues to address in counseling.**  That's a really common fear, that people think their problems are too complex or too numerous.  A good therapist is trained to work with complexity. In fact, often these things are intertwined - the trauma, the cancer, the sleep, the depression, the anxiety, the self-esteem... they likely *all* impact each other.

Here's a breakdown of why your concerns are valid, and why therapy can absolutely help, and how to approach it.  I'll cover a lot here, so it will be lengthy.  Please read through it, and I'll also add a disclaimer at the end.

**1. Why it Feels Like ""Too Much""**

* **It's a Lot to Face:**  Simply confronting these things, even *thinking* about confronting them, is daunting. It's natural to feel like it's too much to unravel.
* **Fear of Re-traumatization:**  Talking about sexual abuse is incredibly difficult, and you might worry about re-experiencing the pain.
* **Long History:**  A lifetime of insomnia, a long battle with depression... it feels ingrained, like a part of who you are.  Change can feel impossible after so long.
* **The ""Good"" Alongside the Hard:** Having a happy marriage complicates things. You might feel guilty about focusing on your own pain when you have something good in your life. Or worry about how exploring these issues will impact your marriage.
* **Never Having Done This Before:** The unknown is scary.  You've coped with all of this on your own for so long, the idea of letting someone *in* is a big step.



**2. Why Therapy *Can* and *Will* Help**

* **Untangling the Threads:**  A skilled therapist won't try to fix everything at once. They'll help you understand how these issues are connected and work with you to prioritize.  It’s not about a checklist of problems, but a holistic understanding of *you*.
* **Trauma-Informed Care:**  Because of your history of sexual abuse, it's *critical* to find a therapist who is specifically trained in trauma-informed care.  This means they understand the impact of trauma on the brain and body, and they'll approach your healing with sensitivity and safety as the top priorities.  (More on finding a therapist below.)
* **Processing, Not Just Talking:** Therapy isn’t just about recounting events. It’s about processing the *emotions* connected to those events, and learning coping mechanisms to manage those emotions in the present.
* **Addressing the Physical:**  The link between trauma, depression, anxiety, and insomnia is strong.  Therapy can help you develop strategies for better sleep hygiene, and also explore how your physical health is impacted by your emotional state.
* **Building Self-Esteem:**  Your history and experiences have likely eroded your self-worth.  Therapy can help you identify your strengths, challenge negative self-beliefs, and build a stronger sense of self.
* **Supporting Your Marriage:**  A good therapist will *not* see your marriage as a problem to be fixed. They can help you communicate more effectively with your husband, navigate difficult conversations, and strengthen your bond as you work through your individual healing.  (You might even consider couples counseling at some point, *after* you've done some individual work.)
* **Anxiety Management:**  Therapy can provide tools and techniques (like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or CBT) to manage your anxiety symptoms.



**3. How to Approach Counseling Given Your History**

* **Start Slow:** You don't have to tell your therapist everything in the first session.  It's okay to start with what feels most manageable. You can say, ""I have a lot of history to unpack, and I'm not sure where to begin.""
* **Prioritize:**  Work with your therapist to identify what feels most pressing.  Perhaps starting with the current anxiety or insomnia would be a good entry point, as addressing those can create a sense of immediate relief.
* **Safety First:**  If you're hesitant to discuss the abuse right away, that's okay. Your therapist should respect your pace and never push you to disclose anything you're not ready for.  A good therapist will create a safe and trusting environment.
* **Be Honest:**  This is hard, but crucial.  Be honest about your feelings,"
"I have PTSD. The side effects are really bad and have impacts on sex, anger and my relationships. I even lost my job month ago.    How can I get my life back?","Slowly is the rate at which you'll get back your life.Being traumatized means not feeling safe in almost all areas of life.Be patient with yourself as you try to regain trust that people will not harm you and will be sources of satisfaction in your life.It is possible that the trauma in your life requires such great attention on your part to your own inner emotional safety that you are better off with a less intensive job than the one you recently lost.Try to prioritize restoring your emotional and psychological health.  With this as the top area of your attention then you may have an easier time to accept a lesser degree of involvement in your work and relationships.When you feel angry, try to examine if underlying the anger are feelings of stress, fear, insecurity regarding your position in relationship to the person toward whom you feel angry.   Anger is often the surface reaction to more destabilizing emotions like fear and insecurity.Gradually by nurturing and comforting yourself, living at a pace which is uniquely comfortable to what and how much you can handle, you'll regain your trust in both yourself and relating to others.","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult, and I'm really sorry to hear you're going through this. Losing your job on top of everything else with PTSD is a huge blow. It's completely understandable that you feel lost and overwhelmed.  It's brave of you to reach out and ask for help, even just acknowledging it all is a big step.  Let's break down a path forward, understanding that this will be a process, not a quick fix.  I'll cover a lot here, and it's important to remember you don't have to do *everything* at once.  Prioritize and start small.

**1. Prioritize Safety and Stabilization:**

*   **Self-Care as a Foundation:** This isn't about bubble baths (though those can be nice!). This is about the basics:
    *   **Sleep:**  Aim for a regular sleep schedule. PTSD often disrupts sleep.  Talk to a doctor about options if you're struggling (medication, sleep hygiene techniques).
    *   **Nutrition:**  Eat regular, nourishing meals.  Avoid excessive caffeine, alcohol, and sugar, as these can exacerbate anxiety and mood swings.
    *   **Movement:**  Gentle exercise (walking, yoga, stretching) can release endorphins and help regulate your nervous system.  Don't push yourself, but aim for some daily movement.
    *   **Grounding Techniques:**  These help bring you back to the present moment when you're feeling overwhelmed. Examples:
        *   **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
        *   **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deliberate breaths can calm your nervous system.
        *   **Mindful Activities:**  Focusing on a simple task (like washing dishes) with full attention.
*   **Create a Safe Environment:**  This means both physically and emotionally.  If certain places or situations trigger you, try to avoid them (as much as possible initially) or have a plan for coping if you encounter them.  Limit contact with people who are unsupportive or triggering.
* **Limit Exposure to Triggers:** While avoidance isn't a long-term solution, in the initial stages of stabilization, minimizing exposure to things that cause intense reactions is vital.



**2. Addressing the PTSD – Therapy is Key:**

*   **Evidence-Based Therapies:** These are the most effective treatments for PTSD:
    *   **Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT):** Helps you process the traumatic event(s), challenge negative thought patterns, and develop coping skills.
    *   **Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR):**  Uses bilateral stimulation (e.g., eye movements) to help reprocess traumatic memories.
    *   **Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT):** Focuses on challenging and modifying unhelpful beliefs about the trauma.
    *   **Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE):**  Gradually exposes you to trauma-related memories and situations in a safe and controlled environment.
*   **Finding a Therapist:**
    *   **Psychology Today:**  A directory of therapists with filters for specialization (PTSD), insurance, and location: [https://www.psychologytoday.com/](https://www.psychologytoday.com/)
    *   **National Center for PTSD:**  Provides resources and information about PTSD treatment: [https://www.ptsd.va.gov/](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/) (even if you're not a veteran, the information is helpful)
    *   **Your Insurance Provider:**  Contact them for a list of in-network therapists.
    *   **Community Mental Health Centers:**  Often offer lower-cost services.
*   **Be Patient:** Therapy takes time and effort.  It can be emotionally challenging, but it's worth it.  Don't be afraid to try different therapists until you find one you connect with.

**3. Tackling Specific Impacts:**

*   **Sex and Intimacy:** PTSD can significantly impact sexual desire, arousal, and the ability to feel safe and connected during intimacy.
    *   **Communicate with your partner:**  Open and honest communication is crucial.  Explain what you're experiencing and what you need.
    *   **Sensate Focus:**  A technique often used in sex therapy that involves non-demanding touch and gradually reintroducing intimacy. (Best done with"
I read that you should ignore them and they have to come to a conclusion that they were wrong on their own terms. Is that correct?,"It is not correct because someone who is narcissistic believes they are always right.If you ignore the person, then their thinking is that there is something wrong with you.Ignoring the person to the degree this is possible in the situation or relationship, will spare you to be misunderstood further.","Okay, you're referring to a very common piece of advice when dealing with someone who is stuck in a belief, especially a belief that's causing conflict, and particularly with people who are resistant to changing their minds. The idea of ""ignoring them and letting them come to their own conclusion"" has a lot of nuance, and you're right to ask if it's correct. Here's a breakdown of the idea, why it *can* work, why it's not a universal solution, and what the underlying principles are.  I'll try to be thorough.

**The Core Idea: Why It's Suggested**

The suggestion stems from several psychological principles:

* **Reactance:** When people feel their freedom to believe what they want is being threatened, they often dig in *harder* to their original position.  Directly challenging someone often triggers reactance.  Think of a teenager being told ""You *must* clean your room!"" – the likely result is resistance, not compliance.
* **Cognitive Dissonance:**  This is the discomfort people feel when holding conflicting beliefs.  If you present information that clashes with their deeply held belief, they'll often try to reduce the dissonance, not by changing the belief, but by rejecting the information, discrediting the source, or rationalizing.  
* **Ego Investment:** People often build their identity around their beliefs.  Admitting they were wrong can feel like an attack on their ego, their intelligence, or their values.  It's incredibly vulnerable to say ""I was mistaken.""
* **The Backfire Effect:**  In some cases, attempts to correct misinformation can actually *strengthen* the original, incorrect belief.  This is particularly true when the belief is emotionally charged.
* **Internal Motivation:**  Change is most lasting when it's internally motivated.  If someone comes to a conclusion on their own, they're far more likely to truly accept it and change their behavior.  Externally imposed change rarely sticks.



**How ""Ignoring"" Works (and what it really means)**

""Ignoring"" isn't about literally cutting someone off or being rude.  It's a strategic approach that usually involves these elements:

* **Stopping the Argument:**  Recognize when a conversation is going in circles, becoming hostile, or simply isn't productive.  Politely disengage.  This might sound like:  ""I see we're not going to agree on this right now,"" or ""Let's agree to disagree,"" or simply, ""I'm not going to continue this conversation.""
* **No Further Reinforcement:** Stop providing fuel for the argument. This means:
    * **Don't engage in debates.** Don't offer counter-arguments, facts, or evidence.  
    * **Don't get drawn into emotional reactions.**  Stay calm and neutral.  Responding with anger or frustration validates the argument and keeps it going.
    * **Don't try to ""fix"" them.**  You can't force someone to change their mind.
* **Creating Space for Reflection:** By removing the pressure of immediate rebuttal, you give the person space to process information, consider other perspectives, and potentially recognize inconsistencies in their own thinking.  This is the crucial part – the ""letting them come to their own conclusion"" aspect.
* **Living Your Truth:**  Continue living your life in a way that demonstrates your values and beliefs *without* constantly defending them.  This can be a powerful, subtle form of influence. (See examples below).



**When This Approach is *Most* Likely to Work**

* **The belief isn't causing immediate harm:** If someone's belief is leading to dangerous behavior (e.g., refusing medical treatment, engaging in harmful conspiracy theories with real-world consequences), you need to address it more directly (potentially with the help of professionals).  ""Ignoring"" is not appropriate in those situations.
* **You have a reasonably healthy relationship:** This strategy is more likely to work with someone you have a pre-existing relationship with, built on trust and respect, even if you disagree on this particular issue.
* **You've already presented your perspective:** If you've already clearly and respectfully explained your viewpoint, and they've still rejected it, continuing to repeat yourself is unlikely to be effective.
* **The person is somewhat self-aware:**  If they are capable of introspection and considering different viewpoints, even if they don't do it easily, there's a better chance they'll eventually question their own beliefs.
* **Time and exposure to other viewpoints:**  Over time, and with exposure to diverse perspectives (not necessarily from you, but from other sources), the person may start to re-evaluate their position.



**When This Approach is *Not* Likely to Work (and what to do instead)**

"What am I doing wrong? My wife and I are fighting all the time. What can I do? We don't agree on anything and she usually jumps to conclusions, which are usually wrong on how I feel. She is very family-oriented while all of my family left me on my butt, abused, ignored and messed up with me mentally. I'm not a family-oriented person. I only have two people in my life - my best friend and my wife.  

My mother forced my father out of my life so I do not know who he really is. We've gotten in contact but he just makes comments on how much I look like her when in fact I look more like him.  This makes me mad because I don't want to look like my mother. I hate her. All that she did was bring me down and make me homeless, which she was successful at.  I need guidance in my life.  I don't want to lose my wife but we need to have a space because we usually hit each other and it's not healthy. I'm dying to make our relationship healthy. I've never wanted anything more than this. Please help me. I need your advice.","Hello. It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight, and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage. I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now. Marriages take lots of work, and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young - good, bad, or indifferent. There are no easy answers to your questions, and I won't presume that my response to you will be the linch-pin that heals all your pain. But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. No one is perfect. We fail more often than we succeed, but in the end we learn, and that learning helps us grow. Yes, you're right, the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good, and need to stop. You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard, and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. Seeing a therapist for yourself, and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. You have issues that you need to resolve, that, while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life, they are separate from your marriage in many respects.Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. You can find these through local counseling resources. Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. If you belong to a religious or spiritual community, then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed, so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you.Lastly, parents are imperfect. Yep...its true. They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. We limp along and do our best. Having said that, we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future, no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid, and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. Both with ourselves, and toward other people. So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit.  I am sure that remains to be seen, but either way you both must be involved in saving it. If only one of you cares, then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. That's not fair. So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants, and work to create an amicable solution. All of this said, seek out supportive friends, and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life. One way or the other, you will benefit from it.Be well.","Okay, this is a lot, and it sounds incredibly painful. It's good that you're recognizing the issues and *want* to fix things. That's a huge first step. It's also incredibly important you've recognized the physical violence is not okay and needs to stop. Let's break this down into sections – what's happening, why it's happening, and what you can *do*.  This will be long, but comprehensive, because you've shared a lot.  I'll also include a **very important disclaimer at the end.**

**1. Understanding What's Happening**

* **Core Value Clash:** You and your wife have fundamentally different orientations towards family.  She values it deeply; you understandably recoil from it due to your trauma. This isn't about right or wrong, it's about deeply ingrained beliefs shaped by life experience.  This *will* cause friction.
* **Miscommunication & Assumptions:**  Her jumping to conclusions about your feelings is a major problem. It indicates a lack of trust in your ability to articulate yourself and potentially a desire to control the narrative. It also suggests she's projecting her own feelings and expectations onto you.
* **Unresolved Trauma:** Your past is *actively* impacting your present. The abuse, abandonment, homelessness, and complicated relationship with both parents are huge wounds. These aren’t things you just ""get over.""  They affect your emotional regulation, your trust, your attachment style, and how you navigate relationships.
* **Emotional Reactivity:**  The comments about your appearance, specifically linking you to your mother, are deliberately hurtful (even if your father isn't fully aware of the depth of your feelings). Your anger is completely justified. This highlights the ongoing pain and the need to establish boundaries with your father.
* **Cycle of Violence:** The physical altercations are the most critical issue.  Even if they're infrequent, any physical violence is unacceptable and creates a dangerous and damaging environment.  It's a symptom of deeper issues and will escalate without intervention.



**2. Why This is Happening - Digging Deeper**

* **Attachment Styles:**  Given your history, you likely have an avoidant or anxious-avoidant attachment style.  This means you might struggle with intimacy, fear rejection, and have difficulty trusting others. Your wife might have a more secure or anxious attachment style, leading to the clashes you're experiencing.
* **Unmet Needs:**  Both you and your wife likely have unmet needs in the relationship.  She might need reassurance of your love and commitment, which you struggle to give due to your trauma. You might need space and understanding, which she might interpret as rejection.
* **Lack of Emotional Skills:**  You both might lack the skills to navigate difficult conversations and emotional conflict constructively. This can lead to escalation and reactive behavior.  Learning communication techniques is crucial.
* **Unprocessed Grief and Anger:** You're carrying a lot of grief and anger about your past.  These emotions need to be processed in a healthy way, or they will leak into your relationship.
* **Your Father’s Comments:** His comments aren’t about your appearance; they’re about *him* and his need to assert some kind of connection, however misguided. It’s about his unresolved issues, not you.



**3. What You Can Do - Practical Steps**

This will require effort from both of you, but you can start with these things:

* **STOP THE VIOLENCE IMMEDIATELY:**  This is non-negotiable.  Separate *physically* when you feel an argument escalating.  Go to different rooms.  Leave the house if necessary.  This is about safety.  Consider a cooling-off period of several days if necessary after an incident.
* **Individual Therapy (Crucial):** You *need* to work through your trauma with a qualified therapist.  Look for someone specializing in trauma-informed care, complex PTSD, or attachment issues.  This isn't about blaming your mother (though processing that relationship is part of it); it's about healing *you*. Your wife also might benefit from individual therapy to explore her own needs and attachment style.
* **Couples Therapy (Highly Recommended):** Once *both* of you are engaged in individual therapy, couples therapy can provide a safe space to learn communication skills, identify patterns, and work through your disagreements.  Look for a therapist trained in Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) or Gottman Method.
* **Communication Skills:**
    * **""I"" Statements:**  Instead of saying ""You always jump to conclusions,"" say ""I feel misunderstood when assumptions are made about my feelings.""
    * **Active Listening:**  Really listen to what your wife is saying, without interrupting or formulating your response.  Paraphrase what she says to ensure you understand. (“So,"
I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"The best way to move on is to give yourself sufficient time and space away from your ex so you can heal.  That means no checking out your ex on social media platforms and no contact.  In order to move on and diminish the obsessions, help yourself recognize and accept that the relationship is over, and make sure to get sufficient support in processing all your feelings.  Once that takes place, it can be useful to explore and process with a professional the meaning of the relationship and to understand your part in what transpired.Sometimes people obsess because they have difficulties accepting what's already taken place and want things to be different.  The key to moving forward is to be loving toward yourself, to give yourself permission to grieve the loss, and to start cultivating new and healthy habits/patterns.  Reengage in your present life, ask yourself what you want your life to look like, and start creating goals and taking small steps to create the amazing life you want for yourself.","Okay, this is *so* tough, and it's completely normal to be obsessing after a terrible breakup. It's a genuine loss, and your brain is trying to make sense of it.  It's good you're asking for help – that's a huge first step. Here's a breakdown of how to start moving on, broken down into sections, with a lot of detail.  I'll cover a lot, so feel free to focus on the parts that resonate most with you right now.  I'll also add a disclaimer at the end.

**1. Allow Yourself to Grieve (This is Crucial)**

*   **Feel the Feelings:**  Don't try to suppress or ""be strong"" right now.  Sadness, anger, confusion, loneliness, even relief – *all* of it is valid.  Let yourself cry, scream into a pillow, journal, whatever you need to do to express it.  Trying to bottle it up will only prolong the pain.
*   **Time is a Factor, But Not Linear:**  There's no set timeline for grief.  Some days will be better than others.  You might feel like you're making progress, then get hit with a wave of sadness.  That's okay.  It doesn't mean you're failing.
*   **Rituals of Release:**  Consider symbolic acts to help you release the past. This could be:
    *   Writing a letter you *don't* send, detailing everything you want to say.
    *   Creating a ""memory box"" (see section 3) and then putting it away.
    *   Burning (safely!) something that represents the relationship (a photo, a small gift).
    *   A symbolic letting-go ceremony (e.g., releasing balloons with written wishes).
*   **Self-Compassion:** Talk to yourself like you would talk to a friend going through the same thing.  Be kind, understanding, and patient with yourself.



**2.  Cut Contact (Seriously, This is Hard But Essential)**

*   **No Contact Rule:** This is the hardest part, but often the most effective.  Absolutely no contact: no texts, calls, emails, social media stalking, ""accidental"" run-ins, or asking mutual friends about them.  Even seemingly innocent check-ins can set you back.
*   **Unfollow/Mute/Block:** On social media, unfollow, mute, or even block them.  Seeing their posts will only fuel your obsession and prevent you from moving forward.  It's not about being ""mean,"" it's about self-preservation.
*   **Resist the Urge to Reach Out:**  When you feel the urge, remind yourself *why* you're doing this.  Write down a list of reasons why the relationship didn't work, and read it when you're tempted to break no contact.  Distract yourself immediately (see section 4).
*   **Explain to Mutual Friends (Briefly):**  You don't need to go into detail, but let them know you need space and would appreciate it if they didn't share information about your ex with you.  ""I'm really trying to move on, and hearing about [ex's name] makes it harder.  I'd appreciate your support in respecting my space.""
*   **Avoid Places You Associate With Them:** At least for a while, avoid restaurants, parks, or other places that hold strong memories.




**3.  Deal with Reminders (They're Everywhere!)**

*   **Physical Reminders:**  
    *   **Remove/Repack:**  Put away photos, gifts, and anything else that reminds you of them. You don't have to throw everything away (unless you want to), but store it somewhere out of sight.  A ""memory box"" can be helpful – a designated place for these items, but one you don't regularly open.
    *   **Declutter:**  If you shared items, decide who gets what.  If it's too difficult, consider donating or selling them.
*   **Digital Reminders:**
    *   **Delete Photos/Videos:**  This can be tough, but it's liberating.  Back them up if you feel you need to, but then delete them from your phone and easily accessible folders.
    *   **Delete Texts/Emails:**  The same principle applies.
    *   **Unsubscribe:**  If you shared streaming accounts or email lists, unsubscribe.
*   **Mental Reminders:**
    *   **Thought Stopping:**  When you catch yourself dwelling on the past, consciously say ""Stop!"" or visualize a stop sign. Then, redirect your thoughts to something else (see section"
How does a person start the counseling process?,The first thing to do is to reflect on what you want to seek counseling. Search online and then set up a phone consultation. A person can find out a lot about a counselor and the services that they offer over the phone. After a consultation then set up an intake questions. The overall goal is to make sure that you are comfortable with the counselor and the services they can offer.,"Okay, let's break down how a person can start the counseling process. It can feel daunting, but here's a comprehensive guide, covering everything from recognizing the need to attending that first session.  I'll categorize it into steps to make it easier to follow.

**1. Recognizing the Need & Initial Self-Reflection**

*   **Identify What's Going On:** This is the hardest part for many.  It's about acknowledging that something isn't right and that you could benefit from support. This could be anything from:
    *   **Specific Issues:** Anxiety, depression, grief, relationship problems, trauma, addiction, stress, anger management, eating disorders, etc.
    *   **General Feelings:**  Feeling overwhelmed, persistently sad or empty, stuck, having difficulty coping, feeling like you're not living up to your potential, or a sense of dissatisfaction with life.
    *   **Life Transitions:**  Major changes like job loss, divorce, moving, becoming a parent, or an empty nest.
    *   **Behavioral Changes:**  Noticeable shifts in sleep patterns, appetite, energy levels, social interaction, or increased irritability.
*   **Self-Help First (Optional, but often helpful):**  Before jumping into therapy, some people find it beneficial to try some self-help strategies:
    *   **Journaling:**  Writing down thoughts and feelings.
    *   **Mindfulness/Meditation:**  Practices to focus on the present moment.
    *   **Support Groups:** Connecting with others facing similar challenges (can be online or in person).
    *   **Books/Articles:**  Reading about the issues you're facing.  *However, these are not replacements for professional help if you need it.*
* **Understand it's a sign of strength, not weakness.** Seeking help is a proactive step toward well-being.



**2. Finding a Counselor/Therapist**

This is where it gets more practical. There are many avenues:

*   **Insurance Provider:** *This is often the first stop for many.*
    *   **Website/Member Portal:** Most insurance companies have online directories where you can search for in-network providers (therapists who accept your insurance).  This will significantly reduce your out-of-pocket costs.
    *   **Member Services:** Call the member services number on your insurance card. They can help you find providers and understand your coverage.
*   **Online Directories:** These are excellent resources, even if you have insurance.  They often have more detailed profiles than insurance directories.
    *   **Psychology Today:** [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists) (Very popular and comprehensive)
    *   **GoodTherapy:** [https://www.goodtherapy.org/](https://www.goodtherapy.org/) (Focuses on ethical and healthy therapy)
    *   **Open Path Collective:** [https://openpathcollective.org/](https://openpathcollective.org/) (Offers affordable therapy options for those who qualify)
    *   **TherapyDen:** [https://www.therapyden.com/](https://www.therapyden.com/) (Focuses on inclusivity and diverse therapists)
*   **Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs):**  Many employers offer EAPs, which provide a limited number of free counseling sessions.
*   **Referrals:**
    *   **Primary Care Physician (PCP):** Your doctor can often provide referrals to mental health professionals.
    *   **Friends/Family:**  If you feel comfortable, ask trusted friends or family if they have any recommendations. *Be mindful of confidentiality.*
    *   **Other Healthcare Providers:**  If you're seeing other healthcare professionals (e.g., a psychiatrist), they might be able to recommend a therapist.
* **University Counseling Centers:** If you are a student, your university likely has a counseling center that offers services.
* **Community Mental Health Centers:** These centers provide affordable mental health services to the public.

**3. Considering Different Types of Counselors & Therapy**

*   **Types of Mental Health Professionals:**
    *   **Psychiatrist (MD or DO):**  Medical doctor who can prescribe medication.  Often focuses on biological aspects of mental health.
    *   **Psychologist (PhD or PsyD):**  Doctoral degree in psychology.  Provides therapy and psychological testing.  Generally *cannot* prescribe medication (except in a few states with specific training).
    *   **Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) / Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC):**  Master's degree in counseling.  Provides therapy.
    *   **Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCS"
"I was in a relationship with a woman for four years. We both made mistakes, but I do love her.    She has moved in with another lady. I think she is just cheating on me to make me miss her. How can I find out for sure?","Has your former partner made any efforts to be in contact with you in order to restart your relationship?From what you describe, your former partner is in a new relationship.It is possible that since you love her and would like to be together again, that you are misinterpreting your former partner's actions.If you'd like to have more certainty as to wether your former partner is cheating or whether she is happy to be with the new partner, is to contact her and ask her your question.A better road may be to accept your sad feelings that she is with someone else.Since she was meaningful to you, respect the sadness you feel and that the relationship didn't continue as you wished.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling confused, hurt, and wanting to understand what's *really* going on. The feeling of ""is this real, or is this to make me jealous?"" is common in these circumstances.  However, it's important to approach this with a lot of caution and self-respect. Here's a breakdown of how to think about this, what you *can* do, and, importantly, what you *shouldn't* do, along with a focus on your well-being.

**First: Let's Address the Core Issue - Your Feelings and Assumptions**

* **It's okay to hurt:**  Four years is a significant investment.  It's normal to be deeply affected by this, even if the relationship wasn't perfect.  Allow yourself to grieve the loss of the relationship and the future you imagined.
* **The ""Making You Miss Her"" Theory:** It *is* possible she's doing this to provoke a reaction.  Some people handle breakups very poorly and engage in manipulative behavior.  However, it's equally possible this is a genuine connection she's exploring.  **You need to be prepared for both scenarios.**  Fixating on the ""making you miss her"" idea can prevent you from accepting reality, whichever that may be.
* **Focus on What *You* Know:**  Right now, you're operating on assumptions and feelings.  Those are valid, but they aren't facts.  The goal isn't to ""catch"" her, but to gain clarity for *yourself* so you can move forward.
* **Your Worth:**  Regardless of her motivations, *you* deserve honesty and respect.  The fact that she's moved in with someone else (or appears to be) suggests a level of disrespect for your feelings, even if her intentions are misguided.  Remember this.



**What You *Can* Do (Carefully and Respectfully):**

1. **Direct, Limited Communication (Potentially):**  This is the hardest, and might not be the best option, but it's the most direct. *Only* do this if you can remain calm and rational.  A text or short, neutral phone call could be: ""I saw you've moved in with [her partner's name].  I'm still processing everything.  I would appreciate honesty about what this means for us. I need to understand, for my own peace of mind.""
   * **Important Caveats:**
      * **Prepare for any answer.**  She might tell you the truth, she might lie, or she might not respond.  Be ready for all of those.
      * **Do NOT beg, plead, or try to guilt her.** This will only hurt you more and won’t give you the clarity you seek.
      * **One conversation only.**  Don't get drawn into a back-and-forth.  You're asking for a simple explanation, not re-negotiating the relationship.
      * **Consider if this will actually help *you*.** If you think it will just cause more pain and confusion, skip this step.

2. **Social Media Observation (With Extreme Caution):**  This is a slippery slope.  It's tempting to obsessively check her social media, but it will likely make you feel worse. 
   * **If you do look:**  Look for *consistent* patterns of a genuine relationship (photos together over time, tagging each other, etc.).  A single post doesn't mean much.  
   * **Limit your time.** Set a strict time limit for checking, and then *stay off* social media for a while.  Consider unfollowing or muting her to protect yourself.
   * **Don't read into things.** Social media is a curated highlight reel. Don’t assume things based on what you see.

3. **Mutual Friends (Very Carefully):**  This is the riskiest option and should be approached with extreme caution.
   * **Avoid asking directly about the relationship.**  That puts your friends in an awkward position.
   * **Listen, don't interrogate.** If a friend *voluntarily* offers information, listen without pressing for details.
   * **Be prepared for biased information.**  Friends may have their own opinions or be protective of your ex.
   * **Don't create drama.**  The goal isn't to gather evidence; it's to get a general sense of the situation if it arises organically.  Don't *ask* them to spy on her.



**What You Absolutely Should *NOT* Do:**

* **Spying/Stalking:**  This is illegal, unethical, and incredibly damaging to your own well-being.  Do not"
My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.,"You should start by speaking with her about what has her so down. Have their been some significant events in her life that have affected her? Have their been significant events in your relationship that can be affecting  you both? If she just stopped drinking, she may be struggling to finding an alternative and healthier behavior. This is something the two of you can explore together. Also, if need be perhaps she can speak to a therapist to discuss her feelings about quitting alcohol. It sounds like you really care and right now she could use all the support she can get despite her pushing you away.","Okay, this is a tough situation, and it's good you're reaching out for advice. It's a lot to navigate, with the sobriety, the depression, and the potential move. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, balancing supporting her with your own feelings, broken down into sections.  I'll cover understanding what's happening, how to support her, addressing the move, and taking care of yourself.  **Important Disclaimer at the end.**

**1. Understanding What's Happening**

* **Sobriety and Depression are Often Linked:**  This is *very* common. Alcohol often masks underlying depression or anxiety. When someone stops drinking, those feelings can surface, and often intensely. It's not that sobriety *caused* the depression, but rather removed a temporary coping mechanism.  It can also disrupt brain chemistry as it readjusts.
* **Withdrawal vs. Depression:** There's a difference.  Early withdrawal can have some depressive symptoms.  But if she's past the initial physical withdrawal phase (usually a week or two, but can be longer depending on how much she drank), it's more likely to be underlying depression being revealed.
* **The Move Request - Why?**  The desire to move is likely *connected* to the depression.  It could be:
    * **A fresh start:** She might feel she can't heal or be happy where she is, associating the place with her drinking.
    * **Escaping triggers:**  Places, people, or routines might be triggering cravings or painful memories.
    * **Feeling overwhelmed:**  Sobriety can be incredibly challenging, and she might feel she needs to simplify her life.
    * **A symptom of the depression itself:** Depression can cause feelings of hopelessness and a belief that things will never get better, leading to wanting to uproot everything.
* **It's Not About You (Probably):** While it's natural to feel hurt and want her to stay, try to understand that this is likely her grappling with internal struggles, not a rejection of *you* specifically.  That's hard to accept, but crucial to how you respond.



**2. How to Support Her (Focus on This First)**

* **Validate Her Feelings:** This is the *most* important thing.  Don't minimize her depression or tell her to ""look on the bright side."" Say things like:
    * ""It sounds like you're really struggling right now.""
    * ""It's okay to feel this way. Sobriety is hard, and it's bringing up a lot.""
    * ""I can see how much pain you're in.""
    * ""Your feelings are valid.""
* **Encourage Professional Help:** This is *essential*.  You are not a therapist.  She needs to talk to a qualified professional.
    * **Suggest therapy:**  ""I'm really worried about you, and I think talking to a therapist could really help you process these feelings.""
    * **Help her find resources:** Research therapists specializing in addiction and/or depression in your area.  Look for support groups (see resources at the end).
    * **Offer to go with her to the first appointment (if she wants):**  This can be a supportive gesture.
* **Be Patient:** Recovery is not linear. There will be good days and bad days.  Be prepared for setbacks.
* **Listen, Really Listen:**  Put down your phone, make eye contact, and truly listen to what she's saying.  Don't interrupt or offer unsolicited advice (unless she asks for it).
* **Help with Practical Things:** Depression can make even simple tasks feel overwhelming. Offer to help with things like:
    * Cooking meals
    * Cleaning
    * Running errands
    * Attending support group meetings with her (if appropriate and she wants you to)
* **Focus on Sober Activities:** Suggest activities you can do together that don't involve alcohol.  This could be anything from going for walks to watching movies to taking a class.
* **Celebrate Small Victories:** Acknowledge and praise her efforts, no matter how small.  ""I'm so proud of you for making it through another day sober."" ""It's great that you went to a meeting today.""




**3. Addressing the Move – Carefully**

* **Don't Immediately Try to Talk Her Out Of It:** Right now, her emotional state is fragile.  Pushing back hard on the move will likely make her feel unheard and could push her away.
* **Understand Her Reasoning:** *Ask* her, calmly and with genuine curiosity, why she wants to move. ""Can you help me understand what's making you feel like a move would be helpful right now?""  Listen *without* interrupting or arguing"
"I'm feeling rejected and frustrated. This is not new. The first month we were together, sex was about every day. Then it slowed down to once a month right away. I love my husband, but I am struggling with this.","   Feeling rejected and frustrated is a reasonable reaction to your experience with your husband. I want to encourage you that his actions may have little to do with you, and regardless of outcomes, I hope you find the help you need to process through your pain and still have hope for your marriage.   If your husband was to work with me I'd explore with him his understanding of, and experience with, intimacy in relationship with others. Furthermore, like other male clients of mine, I'd challenge your husband to secure an updated full medical exam from his PCP (primary care physician) and/or urologist in order to identify or rule out any organic issues which may be causing his apparent lack of desire for sexual intimacy. If there are no physical issues, per se, I would encourage your husband to process further his family of origin story-line regarding rules, roles, sex, and sexuality along with working through his sexual and trauma histories. ","Okay, this sounds really difficult. It's completely understandable that you're feeling rejected and frustrated. A significant shift in intimacy like that, especially so early in a relationship, is bound to be painful and confusing. It's good you recognize you love him, because that gives you a foundation to work from, but it doesn't negate the validity of your feelings *right now*. Let's break this down and talk about how to approach it.  I'll cover understanding what might be happening, how to cope with your feelings, and how to communicate with your husband.

**1. Understanding What Might Be Going On (It's Rarely About You)**

The biggest thing to remember is that a sudden drop in sexual frequency rarely has *only* one cause, and it's very, very rarely a direct reflection of his feelings for you. Here are some possibilities to consider (and these aren't mutually exclusive - it could be a combination!):

*   **Honeymoon Phase Fading:** That initial intense period *is* often a honeymoon phase fueled by novelty, hormones, and a lot of pent-up desire. It's not sustainable for most people long-term. While a drop-off is normal, the *speed* of the drop you describe is significant.
*   **Stress:** Is he under a lot of stress at work? Financial worries? Family issues? Stress is a HUGE libido killer for many men.  It can also manifest as needing more emotional distance.
*   **Underlying Medical Issues:**  This is important to consider.  Low testosterone, erectile dysfunction (which can be caused by anxiety, stress, or physical issues), or other medical conditions can play a role.  He may be embarrassed to talk about this, so sensitivity is key.
*   **Medication Side Effects:**  Certain medications (antidepressants, blood pressure meds, etc.) can affect libido.
*   **Psychological Factors:**  Anxiety, depression, past trauma, body image issues, or even performance anxiety can all impact desire.
*   **Unrealistic Expectations:**  Maybe he felt pressured to keep up with the initial pace and then pulled back when it felt overwhelming.
*   **Communication Issues (General):** Are you generally able to talk openly and honestly with each other about difficult things? If not, that could be contributing to the problem.  He might be avoiding talking about this because he fears conflict.
* **Differing Libidos:** It's possible you both simply have naturally different levels of sexual desire, and the initial frequency was an exception, not the rule.



**2. Coping with Your Feelings (Self-Care is Crucial)**

Before you even talk to him, you need to take care of yourself.  Ignoring your feelings will only make things worse.

*   **Acknowledge Your Pain:**  Don't minimize your feelings of rejection or frustration.  It's okay to be sad, angry, or confused.  Allow yourself to feel those emotions.
*   **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself.  This is hard.  You deserve to feel desired and connected to your husband.
*   **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be incredibly helpful.  It can help you clarify what you're feeling and identify patterns.
*   **Talk to a Trusted Friend/Therapist:**  Venting to a supportive friend can be helpful, but a therapist can provide a more objective and professional perspective.  (Individual therapy is a good idea, regardless of whether you and your husband decide to do couples therapy.)
*   **Focus on Your Own Pleasure:**  This might seem counterintuitive, but focusing on your own sexual wellbeing can empower you and help you feel more confident.  Self-care activities (not necessarily sexual, but anything that makes you feel good about yourself) are important too.
* **Don't Internalize it as Your Fault:**  Resist the urge to think you're not attractive enough or that you're doing something wrong. This is *very* common, but often untrue.




**3. Communicating with Your Husband (This is the Hard Part)**

This conversation needs to happen, and it needs to be approached carefully. Here's how:

*   **Choose the Right Time & Place:**  Don't ambush him after a long day at work or during a stressful time.  Choose a time when you're both relaxed and have plenty of uninterrupted time to talk. A neutral setting (not the bedroom) can be helpful.
*   **""I"" Statements:**  This is *crucial*.  Instead of saying ""You never want to have sex anymore,"" say ""I've been feeling really disconnected and sad about the change in our intimacy, and I miss feeling close to you.""
*   **Focus on Your Feelings, Not Accusations:**  Explain"
"My daughter didn't see her biological father for the last three years. She doesn’t want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse. The visitation is with supervision, but she refuses to see him. Is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy?","Hi Dillon,I'm from Canada, so I don't know the laws in your state. It depends on that a good deal, perhaps. In my opinion, a child should never be forced into a situation where they feel unsafe, even if it is ""supervised"". If the child is old enough to make a strong statement about not wanting to see a parent, then this should be honoured. Unfortunately, the laws don't always uphold a parent's right to do what is best for their child. I recommend you see a lawyer, who will advise you about how to proceed without putting yourself at risk of breaching custody agreements.If you feel your daughter can benefit from therapy, that is a separate question. Or is she already in therapy? A family therapist will typically meet with you alone first, in order to determine if therapy is a wise move for your child. It isn't always appropriate.","Okay, this is a really sensitive and important situation. It's absolutely right of you to prioritize your daughter's feelings and well-being. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, focusing on what's best for her, and why therapy is crucial.  I'll cover a lot of ground, so it's a long response, but hopefully comprehensive. **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am not a legal or medical professional.**

**1. Validate Her Feelings – Absolutely First and Foremost**

*   **Believe her:** The most important thing is to believe your daughter's memories and feelings. Don't minimize what she experienced, even if it's difficult to hear.  Statements like ""That sounds really scary,"" or ""It's okay to feel this way,"" are powerful.
*   **Let her lead:**  Don't try to convince her she *should* want to see him.  Her refusal is a protective mechanism, and it's important to respect that.  Pressuring her will likely be damaging.
*   **Acknowledge her courage:** Tell her how brave she is for sharing these memories and for knowing what she needs to feel safe.
*   **Reassure her safety:**  Repeatedly and consistently tell her that you will *always* protect her.  That you are on her side, and her feelings matter most.



**2. Therapy is Essential – and Should Come *Before* Any Attempt at Visitation**

You are right to consider therapy. It's not just ""better"" to go to therapy first, it's *necessary*. Here's why:

*   **Processing Trauma:**  Experiences like domestic violence and child abuse are deeply traumatic. A therapist specializing in trauma (see section 5 on finding a therapist) can provide a safe space for her to process these memories and develop coping mechanisms.  Simply *remembering* isn't the same as *processing* trauma.
*   **Understanding Her Feelings:** Therapy can help her articulate *why* she doesn't want to see her father.  Is it fear? Anger? Sadness? A combination?  Understanding the root of her feelings is crucial.
*   **Developing Coping Strategies:** A therapist can equip her with tools to manage anxiety, fear, and other emotions that might arise even *thinking* about her father.
*   **Empowerment:**  Therapy can empower her to feel in control of her own choices and boundaries. This is vital. She needs to know she has a voice and that her ""no"" is respected.
*   **Assessing Readiness (If Any):** *A therapist is the only one who can assess whether, and when, any form of contact might be potentially helpful for her – and only if SHE expresses a desire to explore that.*  It's not something you or the court should decide.  The therapist can help her explore those feelings *without* pressure.
*  **Impact of Supervision:** Therapy can help her process what supervised visits might feel like, even if she doesn't go.  It can help her anticipate her emotional reactions and plan for them.

**Do NOT try to ""prepare"" her for a visit before therapy.**  That can be re-traumatizing.



**3.  The Court Order & Legal Considerations**

*   **Inform Your Attorney:**  It’s vital to immediately inform your attorney about your daughter’s refusal and the reasons behind it.  They can advise you on how to present this information to the court.  
*   **Modification of the Order:**  Your attorney can file a motion to modify the visitation order, explaining the situation and requesting a suspension or modification of the supervised visits, at least until your daughter has had sufficient therapy.  The court *should* prioritize the child's well-being.
*   **Documentation:** Keep detailed records of your daughter's statements (written or recorded with her consent if age-appropriate), therapy appointments, and any communication with her father. This documentation will be important if the case goes to court.
*  **Guardian ad Litem:** Depending on the jurisdiction, the court might appoint a Guardian ad Litem (GAL) to represent your daughter's best interests. A GAL will investigate the situation and make recommendations to the court. This can be a valuable resource.

**4.  What About the Father?**

*   **Limited Communication:**  Limit your communication with the father to essential matters related to the legal case.  Do not discuss your daughter's feelings with him directly.
*   **Focus on Her Needs:**  The father's reaction to your daughter's refusal is *his* responsibility, not yours.  Your priority is protecting your daughter.
*  **Parallel Parenting:** If possible, aim for a ""parallel parenting"" approach, where you and the father minimize direct communication"
"I have had a crush on this guy for years. I last talked to him a few years ago when we graduated from high school. We left off on a good note. Should I message him and see how he is doing, or is it too late?","You'll only find out whether or not it is ""too late"", by following through with wanting to message him.Regardless of whether the response you receive is what you'd hoped to hear, including not hearing back from him, you will have done yourself a great honor and respect by following through on a wish and curiosity you've had for some time.","Okay, this is a classic and totally relatable situation! It's *definitely* not automatically too late. Years can pass, and people reconnect all the time. Here's a breakdown of things to consider, and a plan of action, broken down into sections to help you decide and approach it:

**1. Is it ""Too Late""? Let's Deconstruct That.**

*   **No hard and fast rule:** There's no expiration date on a crush, or on reaching out to someone you used to know.
*   **""Too late"" depends on *your* expectations:**  Are you hoping to immediately pick things up romantically? That might be a bigger ask and need a more careful approach. If you just want to reconnect as friends, it's much less pressure.
*   **Life happens:** People move, change, get into relationships... these things are all possible. But you don't *know* what his situation is. Assuming he's unavailable or uninterested without checking is doing him (and yourself!) a disservice.
*   **You left on a good note:** This is HUGE. You're not starting from a place of awkwardness or unresolved issues. That's a really positive starting point.
* **Your feelings:** How strongly do you still feel? If it's a lingering ""what if"" that's been bugging you, reaching out might be worth it for *your* peace of mind, even if nothing romantic comes of it.



**2. Things to Consider Before You Message**

*   **Social Media Stalking (Lightly!):**  I'm not advocating a deep dive, but a quick look at his public social media (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn) can give you a *general* idea of what he's been up to.  This isn't about analyzing every detail, but it can help you tailor your message.  (e.g., if he just graduated from college, you can ask about that).  **Don't overdo this!**  You don't want to seem creepy.
*   **What's Changed for *You*?:**  Think about how you've grown and changed in the past few years.  What are you proud of? What's new in your life? You want to have something to share besides just ""Hi, remember me?"".
* **Be prepared for any outcome:** He might not reply, he might reply politely but not be interested in continuing a conversation, or he might be thrilled to hear from you. Be emotionally prepared for all of those possibilities.




**3. Crafting the Message: Options & Examples**

The key is **casual, friendly, and low-pressure**.  Avoid anything that screams ""I've been pining for you for years!""  Here are a few options, ranging from more cautious to slightly more forward, adapt these to your own voice and your sense of his personality:

**Option A: Very Casual - The ""Remember When..."" Approach** (Good if you're nervous)

```
""Hey [His Name]!  Hope you're doing well.  I was just thinking about [shared memory from high school - a class, a funny event, a sports game] the other day and it made me wonder how you've been.  No worries if you're busy, just thought I'd say hi!""
```

**Option B:  Slightly More Engaging - Asking About His Life**

```
""Hey [His Name], it's [Your Name]!  It feels like ages since graduation.  I was wondering how things are going with you?  Are you still [mention something you remember he was interested in - e.g., playing guitar, into photography]?  I've been [briefly mention something *you've* been up to].""
```

**Option C:  A Bit More Direct (Use if you're feeling confident and sense he might be receptive)**

```
""Hey [His Name]! Hope life is treating you well. I was thinking about our high school days recently and wanted to reach out and see how you're doing. I've been up to [mention something you've been up to], and would love to hear what you've been doing these past few years.""
```

**Important Notes for the Message:**

*   **Keep it short and sweet:**  A wall of text can be intimidating.
*   **Avoid overly emotional language:**  Tone it down.
*   **Don't ask about his relationship status immediately:** Let that come up naturally if he offers the information.
*   **Proofread!**  Typos can give the wrong impression.




**4. What to Do After You Send It (The Waiting Game)**

*   **Be Patient:**  He might not"
"My parents seem okay with other sexualities, but normally they only talk about being gay. When they do talk about bisexuality, they say things like “they'll do anything” or things that make me very uncomfortable because I am bisexual. I don't know if I am ready to come out to them.","Perhaps you are not ready to come out to your parents.  Often times our readiness is not dependent on what others' will say or how they react. But more so dependent on how emotionally prepared we are to deal with others' reactions.  It may be beneficial for you to play out each possible scenario and conclusion (eg. your parents being supportive vs. your parents being disappointed and so on). How are you prepared to deal with the outcome?  You may also seek help through counselors, support groups and/or individuals you know that have dealt with similar situations to help you prepare to discuss this with your parents.  All the best!","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's completely understandable why you're feeling uncomfortable and hesitant about coming out. It sounds like your parents are operating from a place of limited understanding and some potentially harmful stereotypes, even if they *think* they're being accepting. Here's a breakdown of what's going on, and how you can navigate this, along with things to consider about coming out:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Monogay-centric View:** Many people, even allies, fall into the trap of thinking of LGBTQ+ identities as solely gay or lesbian. This is called ""monogayism."" They may have focused their learning and understanding on those identities and haven't broadened it to include the spectrum of experiences within bisexuality, pansexuality, etc.
* **Harmful Stereotypes:**  The ""they'll do anything"" comment is *extremely* problematic. It perpetuates the idea that bisexual people are hypersexual, promiscuous, untrustworthy, or incapable of monogamy. This is a very old and damaging trope. It's not okay for them to say that, even if they don't intend malice.  It's rooted in biphobia.
* **Invalidation:** Even if they *say* they're okay with ""gays,"" minimizing or misrepresenting bisexuality feels invalidating. It makes it harder for you to feel safe and accepted for *who you are*.
* **Your Feelings Matter:** Your discomfort is a HUGE signal.  It's perfectly valid to feel unsafe or unready to come out when you're receiving comments like that. Your well-being is the priority.



**What You Can Do (Without Coming Out - If You're Not Ready)**

These are options to address the issue *before* you feel ready for a full coming-out conversation.

* **Gentle Correction (If You Feel Safe):** When they say something problematic, if you feel emotionally safe enough, you can gently challenge it.  You don't have to make it a huge confrontation. Examples:
    *  ""That comment actually feels a bit hurtful. Bisexuality isn't about 'doing anything,' it's about attraction to more than one gender.""
    *  ""I've heard that stereotype before, and it's not really accurate. It's just like anyone else, people in any sexuality can be in loving, committed relationships.""
    *  ""Hmm, that makes me a little uncomfortable when you say it like that."" (Simple and direct)
* **Introduce Information (Indirectly):**  Share articles, videos, or social media posts about bisexuality (from reputable sources - see resources below).  You can say something like, ""I saw this interesting article about different sexual orientations, and it made me think..."" or just share it without comment.  This subtly introduces them to more accurate information.
* **Focus on Individual Stories:** Share stories of bisexual people (again, from reliable sources).  Humanizing the experience can be more effective than arguing about definitions.
* **Limit Discussion (Self-Protection):** If they consistently make you uncomfortable, it's okay to change the subject or politely excuse yourself from the conversation.  You are not obligated to endure hurtful comments.  ""I'd rather not talk about this right now,"" is perfectly acceptable.
* **Talk to Someone Else:**  Confide in a trusted friend, family member (if you have one who is supportive), therapist, or online support group.  Having a safe space to process your feelings is essential.



**Considering Coming Out (When *You* Are Ready)**

* **You are in control:** *You* decide when, how, and if you come out. There is no right or wrong timeline.
* **Assess the Risk:** Based on their past behavior, what do you anticipate their reaction to be?  Do you think it will be mostly accepting, mixed with some confusion, or potentially negative?
* **Safety First:**  If you fear a hostile reaction that could jeopardize your safety (emotional, physical, or financial), it's okay to wait.  Your safety is paramount.
* **Plan What You Want to Say:**  Write down some talking points. This can help you stay calm and focused.  You might want to explain:
    * What bisexuality means to *you*.
    * How you've been feeling.
    * What you need from them (e.g., acceptance, understanding, respect).
    * That this doesn't change who you are as a person.
* **Choose the Right Time and Place:** Pick a time when you're all relatively calm and relaxed, and a place where you feel safe and comfortable.
* **Consider a Letter:**  Some people find it easier to express themselves in writing.  A letter allows you to"
"I've been going through a rough time lately. I been into nothing but women. I’ve never thought about men until a week ago. I’m very upset and depressed about this. It's not normal to me. I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that I’m not gay. I get the same results each time, and I feel disgust. This is tough on me. I'm scared that I looked too many times. I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.","Hello. Coming to terms with the idea that you might be of a sexuality other than the one in which you were socially raised to be, can be emotionally disturbing, and quite unsettling. It creates anxiety, maybe even panic, and leaves us feeling confused and uncertain about our own sense of identity. It becomes important to first ask yourself how you feel when you are thinking of being intimate with guys, or if you desire them to be intimate with you. It is important to know what impact this has on you, because it can determine your level of follow through and desire in pursuing sexual activity with someone of the same sex. I am not going to pass judgment on you either way - even for having the thoughts. I have worked with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) community in various ways over the years. Many I speak to, say they had to struggle to come to terms with this awareness about how they see themselves sexually. Maybe you are bisexual, and don't have an exclusive attraction to the same sex. You might consider doing some searches online for community support groups in your area, to explore the feelings and issues around this topic. Talking to someone who you trust can be helpful too. Running from your feelings is not a good idea, and others in a support group for sexuality issues, might be able to relate to you and what you're going through right now. This will offer you perspective, as you think on how this plays out in your life.Counselors are typically well trained to provide clinical services to clients who are experiencing feelings and thoughts much like the ones you are having now. I encourage you to consider reaching out for help. You are not crazy or insane for thinking of working with a counselor, nor of having feelings of same sex attraction. If you decide you are indeed gay, then know that you are not alone and never will be alone in that feeling. There is a huge community of support for you. Additionally, we all need help sometimes dealing with all sort of issues. A counselor can work more in depth with you to examine the motivations behind the feelings, and help you come to terms with them more directly. I hope that you come to a place where you feel less alone and more secure with yourself as you examine this area of your life. No matter what, do not fear being yourself. Again...you are not alone, I promise.Warm regards,Shawn Berthel, M.S., LMHC","Okay, this sounds incredibly distressing, and it's really brave of you to reach out and talk about it. It's clear you're experiencing a lot of internal conflict and emotional turmoil. Let's break down what you're saying and then talk about how to navigate this.  I'm going to offer a lot of information, so please take your time reading it.  I will also include a disclaimer at the end, as I am an AI and cannot provide therapy.

**First, let's address the core feelings:**

* **Distress and Depression:** You're understandably feeling down and upset.  Experiencing something that challenges your long-held beliefs about yourself is *very* difficult, and it's okay to feel depressed as a result.
* **Confusion and Fear:**  You've always been attracted to women, and now this new awareness of attraction to men is throwing you for a loop. The fear is understandable – fear of the unknown, fear of what this means for your identity, fear of how others might react.
* **Disgust & Shame:** The disgust you feel *after* looking at gay porn is key. This isn't necessarily about attraction itself, but likely about the conflict between your feelings and your existing beliefs. The shame is likely stemming from societal pressures and internalized homophobia (more on that later).
* **Anxiety and Obsessive Thinking:** The shaking, constant thinking, and worry are all signs of anxiety. The urge to ""prove"" things and the rumination are also classic anxiety patterns.
* **Concern about the ""Looking"":** You're worried about having looked at the porn, feeling like it confirms something you don't want to be true.



**Let's unpack some of the things you've said, and why your reactions are happening:**

* **Sexuality is Fluid:**  One of the most important things to understand is that sexuality isn't always fixed.  Many people experience attractions that don't fit neatly into ""straight"" or ""gay"" categories.  This is called *sexual fluidity*.  It's perfectly normal for attractions to shift and change over time, or for someone to realize they have attractions they never expected.  It doesn’t invalidate past experiences or attractions.
* **Experimentation and Exploration:** It's not uncommon for people to explore their curiosity.  Looking at porn, even to ""disprove"" something, is a form of exploration.  The *reaction* to it is what's important, not the act itself.  Your disgust suggests your internal compass is still pointing in a direction that feels more aligned with your previous understanding of yourself.
* **Internalized Homophobia:**  This is a huge factor here.  Our society often carries negative messages about homosexuality, even subtle ones.  If you grew up in an environment where being gay was frowned upon, those messages can get internalized, meaning you start to believe them yourself.  This can lead to feelings of shame, guilt, and disgust even when experiencing harmless attraction.  The disgust *isn't* necessarily about the *attraction*, it's about your internal response to that attraction being different than you expected.
* **The ""Prove"" Cycle:**  Trying to ""prove"" your sexuality through experimentation is a common, but unhelpful, cycle. It reinforces the anxiety and doesn’t offer any real answers.  Sexuality isn't something you *prove*; it's something you *feel* and *accept*.  
* **The Intensity of the Reaction:**  The intensity of your reaction – the shaking, the constant thinking – suggests a deeply held belief system is being challenged. This is why it's so upsetting.



**What can you do? Here’s a plan of action:**

1. **Stop the ""Testing"":**  Seriously.  Stop looking at porn, either gay or straight, with the intention of figuring something out. It's fueling the anxiety and isn't providing you with clarity.  Instead, focus on understanding your *feelings*.

2. **Self-Compassion:**  Be kind to yourself. You're going through a difficult time, and it's okay to be confused.  Don’t beat yourself up for having these feelings, or for exploring them.  Treat yourself with the same compassion you would offer a friend going through the same thing.

3. **Journaling:**  Write down your thoughts and feelings.  This can help you process what's going on and identify patterns in your thinking.  Don't censor yourself; just let the words flow.  Write about what scares you, what you're curious about, and what you're feeling.

4. **Challenge Negative Thoughts:**  When you catch yourself having negative thoughts (""This is wrong,"" ""I'm disgusting,"" ""I'm not normal""), challenge them. Ask yourself:
    * Is this thought"
"I have known her for years. She was dating my brother-in-law when we met. My kids think of her as their aunt. On Halloween 2014, I lost my mom to cancer. My mom and dad were still married when she passed away. My friend was there for me through that and my own cancer diagnosis. She has been a very big part of both me and my kids’ life, but now last month, my dad told me that he really likes my friend and wants to marry her. She’s like a sister to me. My kids hate the idea.","How are you measuring whether or not your dad understands your wish?Your dad understanding your wish does not mean he will necessarily follow through with what you want.Based on what you describe about your relationship to the woman in question, your discomfort with the idea of your dad marrying your friend, is reasonable.Have the conversation with your dad that includes your viewpoint, and also ask him for his impression of your feelings.Its even possible he already has considered your feelings and hasn't yet told you.It is also possible that a conversation on the subject, as well as your dad following through with his decision to marry your best friend, may develop in a very positive way.Part of the current uneasiness you feel may be from fear of how a change in circumstances and introducing new relationship dynamics might feel.Given that the person who died was your mom, maybe your emotions are not yet ready seeing your dad with a replacement spouse. Try to see the situation from the point of everyone, including yourself, who is involved in this major change.  Maybe having a family discussion about acceptance and readiness to accept a new partner for your dad, would open new empathy for all of these family members.","Okay, this is *incredibly* complicated and understandably painful. You're navigating a minefield of emotions and relationships, and it's good you're acknowledging how deeply unsettling this is. Here's a breakdown of the issues, how to think about them, and some suggestions for how to move forward, broken down into sections.  I'll try to cover a lot of ground, knowing you'll need to pick and choose what resonates.

**1. The Core Conflicts – Let's Name Them**

* **Betrayal (or Perceived Betrayal):** You feel betrayed by both your dad *and* your friend. Your dad is pursuing a relationship with someone you consider family. Your friend, knowing your feelings, is seemingly willing to go along with it. This hits a deep emotional nerve. It's not just about *who* they are, it's about the history and the established roles.
* **Grief Complications:** The fact that this is happening after your mom’s passing and *your* cancer diagnosis adds layers of complexity.  Grief can make us more vulnerable and sensitive.  It can also re-surface old family dynamics.  The timing feels particularly insensitive, even if that's not the intention.
* **Family Disruption:** The potential marriage fundamentally alters your family structure. Your kids' perception of her as an ""aunt"" is threatened. This will change holidays, gatherings, and their sense of family stability.
* **Loyalty Conflict:** You're torn between your love for your dad, your deep friendship, and your loyalty to your children.  You don't want to hurt anyone, but you're being asked to accept something that feels profoundly wrong.
* **Role Confusion/Boundary Violation:** The blurring of lines between friend, sister, and potential stepmother is incredibly jarring. This violates a lot of unspoken rules and expectations.



**2. Understanding Your Dad's Perspective (Without Excusing It)**

This is hard, but trying to understand *why* your dad is doing this (even if you disagree with it) can help you process. Some possibilities (and these aren’t mutually exclusive):

* **Loneliness:**  He's been alone since your mom's passing and is seeking companionship.  This is a natural human need.
* **Familiarity & Comfort:**  He’s known your friend for years, and she provides a sense of comfort and ease. She was there during a difficult time.
* **Reactivity/Rebellion:** (This is less likely, but possible) He might be subconsciously reacting to the loss of your mom by seeking something different. 
* **Genuine Attraction:** He may genuinely have developed romantic feelings for her.  This doesn’t make it *right* in the context of your relationships, but it’s a possible motivation.

**Important:** Understanding doesn't mean condoning. You can acknowledge his needs without agreeing with his actions.

**3. Your Friend's Perspective – A Difficult Conversation is Likely Needed**

This is the hardest part. You need to understand where *she* is coming from.  However, be prepared for a potentially difficult conversation.  She likely knows she’s in a tough spot.

* **Her Feelings:**  Does she reciprocate his feelings? Is she actively pursuing this, or is she hesitant but feeling pressured?
* **Her Loyalty to You:**  Has she considered the impact on your friendship? Does she understand the depth of your discomfort?
* **Her Perspective on Your Dad:**  What does *she* see in him?  Is it companionship, a genuine connection, or something else?

**You need to have a direct, honest, and *calm* conversation with her.**  Focus on your feelings: ""I'm struggling with this because you've been like a sister to me, and the thought of you marrying my dad feels deeply unsettling. I'm worried about how this will impact our friendship and my kids' relationship with you.""  *Avoid* accusatory language.  Don't say, ""You're betraying me.""  Instead, say, ""I feel betrayed by this situation.""

**Be prepared for her to defend her choices.** You may not like what you hear, but understanding her reasoning is crucial.



**4. Addressing Your Kids' Feelings**

Your kids' feelings are paramount. They are experiencing a significant shift in their understanding of family, and their ""aunt"" figure is now potentially becoming a stepmother.

* **Validate Their Emotions:**  Don't dismiss their anger, sadness, or confusion.  Say things like, ""I understand why you're upset. This is a big change, and it's okay to feel however you're feeling.""
* **Age-Appropriate Explanation:**  Explain the situation in a way they can understand, without getting into adult"
"I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year and a half. He loves me a lot, and I love him. It hurts to be apart from him for so long. It hurts all over, and then I feel like it won't last.",I would suggest that you look up the word codependency and it's characteristics.  See if you relate to those characteristics.  I have a feeling  you have suffered some form of loss in your life that you have not dealt with properly.  For some reason you are depending on your boyfriend to fill that loss.  Considering working with a counseling to work through your emotions and resolve any lingering issues.,"Okay, it sounds like you're experiencing a really common and really valid struggle in a relationship - the pain of separation combined with anxieties about the future. It's good you recognize these feelings and are acknowledging them. Let's break this down and explore some things going on, and then talk about some coping strategies.

**What's likely happening here:**

* **Attachment and Secure Base:** After a year and a half, you've likely developed a strong attachment to your boyfriend. He's become your secure base - the person you turn to for comfort, support, and reassurance. When that base is removed (even temporarily), it's *natural* to feel destabilized, anxious, and even physically uncomfortable. That ""hurt all over"" feeling is very real and speaks to that deep connection.
* **Anxiety and Uncertainty:**  The feeling that ""it won't last"" is a classic anxiety response. Separation can trigger fears about the relationship's strength, your boyfriend's feelings, and the possibility of something going wrong while you're apart. This is especially true if you've had past experiences with relationships ending, or if you generally lean towards anxious thinking.
* **Missing the Everyday:**  It's not just the big things you miss, it's the small, everyday moments. The inside jokes, the comfortable silences, the routines you share - these all contribute to a feeling of wholeness. Their absence can be surprisingly painful.
* **Potential for Idealization:**  When apart, it's easy to idealize the relationship, focusing on the good times and downplaying the challenges. This can create a skewed perspective and make the separation feel even more difficult.  (This isn't necessarily a *bad* thing, but something to be aware of).
* **Individual Vulnerabilities:** Your own individual attachment style and past experiences will play a role. If you tend to be more anxiously attached, you may experience separation more intensely.



**Let's try to address this. Here's a breakdown of things you can do, broken down into sections:**

**1. Acknowledge and Validate Your Feelings (Self-Soothing):**

* **It's okay to feel this way.** Don't beat yourself up for being sad or anxious.  This is a normal response to being separated from someone you love.  Saying to yourself, ""It's understandable that I feel this way. It's hard being apart"" can be surprisingly powerful.
* **Journaling:** Write down your feelings.  Don't censor yourself.  Just let it all flow. This can help you process your emotions and identify specific triggers for your anxiety.
* **Self-Care:**  This isn't about bubble baths (though those are nice too!). It's about actively doing things that nourish *you* – things you enjoy, things that relax you, things that make you feel good about yourself. This could be reading, listening to music, exercising, spending time in nature, pursuing a hobby, or anything else that brings you joy.
* **Mindfulness/Meditation:** Even 5-10 minutes of mindfulness a day can help you ground yourself in the present moment and reduce anxiety. There are tons of free apps (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer) to get you started.

**2.  Connect (But Strategically):**

* **Scheduled Connection:**  Instead of sporadic, anxiety-fueled check-ins, agree on a realistic schedule for communication. This might be a phone call every evening, video chats a few times a week, or texting throughout the day. *Having predictability can be very comforting.*
* **Quality over Quantity:**  Focus on *meaningful* connection during your communication. Share what's going on in your life, ask about his, and really listen.  Avoid just filling the silence with superficial chatter.
* **Avoid Excessive Reassurance Seeking:**  It's tempting to constantly ask, ""Do you still love me?"" or ""Are you okay?""  While it's okay to check in occasionally, *excessive* reassurance seeking can actually worsen your anxiety and put pressure on him.
* **Limit Social Media Stalking:**  This can fuel your anxiety and create unrealistic expectations.  It's okay to check in occasionally, but avoid obsessively monitoring his activity.

**3. Focus on *Your* Life:**

* **Distraction (Healthy Distraction):**  This isn't about avoiding your feelings altogether, but about giving yourself a break from them.  Engage in activities that absorb your attention and energy.
* **Social Connection:** Spend time with friends and family.  Reconnect with people you haven't seen in a while.  Having a strong support network is crucial.
* **Personal Goals:**  Focus on your own goals and aspirations.  What are you working towards?  What are you passionate about"

It's a really valid question, and the answer is complex, but overwhelmingly **yes, counseling can be incredibly helpful for a lot of people**. However, it's not a magic bullet, and its effectiveness depends on many factors. Here's a detailed look, covering the evidence, what it helps with, how it works, and what impacts its success.

**1. The Evidence: What Does Research Say?**

*   **Extensive Research Support:**  There's a *huge* body of research supporting the effectiveness of counseling (also often referred to as psychotherapy).  Meta-analyses (studies that combine the results of many other studies) consistently show that counseling is more effective than no treatment for a wide range of mental health issues.
*   **Effect Sizes:**  While often not as dramatic as medication in some cases, counseling demonstrates meaningful effect sizes. This means it produces noticeable and significant improvements in people's lives.  It's important to note that ""effect size"" doesn't mean *everyone* gets completely better, but that *on average*, people show improvement.
*   **Long-Term Benefits:** Studies show that the benefits of counseling can often last long after the therapy has ended, particularly with ongoing practice of learned skills.
*   **Neuroscience Supports It:**  Neuroscience research is increasingly showing *how* counseling works, demonstrating changes in brain activity and structure related to emotional regulation, cognitive processes, and trauma processing.
*   **Specific Examples (with supporting evidence):**
    *   **Depression:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) are consistently shown to be effective for depression, often comparable to medication for mild to moderate depression.
    *   **Anxiety:** CBT is a first-line treatment for many anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety, panic disorder, social anxiety, phobias).
    *   **Trauma (PTSD):**  Trauma-focused therapies like EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) and Trauma-Focused CBT are highly effective.
    *   **Relationship Issues:** Couples therapy (various approaches) can improve communication, resolve conflicts, and increase satisfaction.
    *   **Addiction:**  Counseling is a crucial component of addiction treatment, helping with motivation, relapse prevention, and addressing underlying issues.




**2. What Can Counseling Help With? (It's a Broad Range!)**

Counseling isn't just for ""serious"" mental illness. It can help with:

*   **Mental Health Conditions:** Depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, PTSD, OCD, eating disorders, schizophrenia (often in conjunction with medication).
*   **Emotional Challenges:** Grief, loss, anger management, low self-esteem, feelings of loneliness or isolation.
*   **Life Transitions:**  Job loss, divorce, moving, adjusting to parenthood, retirement.
*   **Relationship Problems:**  Conflict in romantic relationships, family issues, difficulty with friendships.
*   **Stress Management:**  Dealing with work stress, academic pressure, financial worries.
*   **Personal Growth:**  Improving self-awareness, developing coping skills, achieving goals, finding meaning and purpose.
*   **Habit Change:** Breaking unhealthy patterns, building positive habits.
* **Chronic Illness:** Coping with the emotional impact of chronic pain, disease and medical treatment.

**3. How Does Counseling Work? (Different Approaches)**

There are many different types of counseling, each with its own theories and techniques:

*   **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.  Very practical and goal-oriented.
*   **Psychodynamic Therapy:** Explores unconscious patterns and past experiences to understand current behavior.  Often longer-term.
*   **Humanistic Therapy (Person-Centered):** Emphasizes empathy, unconditional positive regard, and the client's inherent capacity for growth.
*   **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):**  A type of CBT that focuses on emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and mindfulness – often used for borderline personality disorder.
*   **Family Systems Therapy:**  Views problems as arising from dysfunctional family patterns and works to improve communication and relationships within the family.
*   **EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing):**  Used primarily for trauma, involves processing disturbing memories through bilateral stimulation (e.g., eye movements).
*   **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):**  Focuses on accepting difficult thoughts and feelings and committing to values-based action.

**The Common Threads:**

*   **Safe & Confidential Space:**  Counseling provides a non-judgmental environment to explore difficult feelings and experiences.
*   **Developing Insight:**  Helping you understand yourself, your patterns, and the roots of your problems."
"I just took a job that requires me to travel far away from home. My family and I really need this job.
   People keep telling me I have ""anxiety"" and I'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road. This is all new to me. What can I do?","Hi, It is really good that you are working so hard to take care of your family. Anxiety can be so challenging, especially when new challenges have come up. It would be good to work through some of these issues you are experiencing, and examine your self care and support processes.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, but it's also incredibly common. Starting a new job *is* stressful, and adding long-distance travel and family separation on top of that is a LOT. It's understandable you're feeling this way, and it's smart of you to proactively look for ways to cope, especially given the concerns about anxiety. Let's break down some things you can do.  I'll cover a lot, so feel free to focus on what resonates with you.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am not a medical professional.**

**1. Understanding What's Happening (and It Might Not Be ""Just Anxiety"")**

*   **It's Normal to Feel This Way:** You're experiencing a massive life change.  It's perfectly natural to feel stressed, worried, and even fearful.  Don't pathologize feeling these things!  A lot of people would be struggling right now.
*   **What *is* an Anxiety Attack?** Knowing what to expect can help. Anxiety attacks (often called panic attacks) aren't like heart attacks. They involve intense physical and emotional sensations – racing heart, shortness of breath, dizziness, trembling, feeling detached, a sense of impending doom. They are *extremely* frightening, but they *are* temporary, and they are not life-threatening.  (Important to remember!).  Knowing this can take some of the power away from the fear.
*   **Is it Anxiety, Adjustment Disorder, or Something Else?**  The people who say you have ""anxiety"" might be onto something, but it could also be *adjustment disorder* (difficulty adjusting to a stressful life event – this job fits that!), or just a very strong stress response.  A professional can help clarify.
* **Don't Self-Diagnose:** While it's good to educate yourself, try not to label yourself.  Let a professional do that.



**2.  Practical Preparations for Travel (Reduce Uncertainty)**

Uncertainty fuels anxiety. The more you can control, the better.

*   **Route Planning:**  Meticulously plan your routes.  Know where you're going, where you'll stop, where hospitals are along the way (just for peace of mind), and alternative routes in case of traffic.
*   **Accommodation:** Book accommodations in advance.  Having a guaranteed place to stay is a huge stress reliever.  Read reviews, know the amenities.
*   **Packing:** Pack carefully.  Include comfort items (see section 4).  Make lists so you don’t forget essentials.
*   **Vehicle/Travel Check:** If driving, ensure your vehicle is in top condition.  If flying, have all your documents readily accessible.  Minimize potential travel hiccups.
* **Emergency Plan:** Have a plan for emergencies - both for travel and for family back home.



**3.  Tools & Techniques to Use *During* Moments of Stress/Worry (In the Moment)**

These are things you can use when you start to feel anxious *while* you're traveling.

*   **Deep Breathing:** This is your #1 tool.  Slow, deep breaths (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 6-8) activate your parasympathetic nervous system (the ""calm down"" system).  Practice this *now* when you're not anxious so it’s easier to use when you are. There are apps that can guide you (Calm, Headspace, Insight Timer).
*   **Grounding Techniques:** These bring you back to the present moment.
    *   **5-4-3-2-1:**  Name 5 things you can *see*, 4 things you can *touch*, 3 things you can *hear*, 2 things you can *smell*, and 1 thing you can *taste*.
    *   **Physical Sensations:**  Focus on the feeling of your feet on the floor, your hands on the steering wheel, the texture of your clothing.
*   **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** Tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body, starting with your toes and working your way up. (Look up guided versions online).
*   **Mindfulness:**  Pay attention to your breath, your surroundings, without judgment.  Just observe.  (Apps like Calm and Headspace can help).
*   **Challenge Negative Thoughts:** When you catch yourself thinking catastrophic thoughts (""I'm going to have an attack and be stranded!""), ask yourself:  ""Is this thought realistic? What's the evidence for and against it?  What's the worst that could *really* happen, and could I cope with it?""
* **Distraction (Use Wisely):** Listen to music, podcasts, audiobooks."
"I'm in my late teens and live with my dad.  The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I won't want to talk to them for days or even weeks. 

Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.

Are they right, am I depressed?","Hello. Being a teenager in our society today can cause depression quite easily. We look at the world in which we live, and the doubts we have about being able to make a contribution, or to have value and worth with the people around us, and we begin to internalize those messages of self-worth. If that alone were not enough, you are trying to figure out where you want to go in life, and who you are supposed to be in the world. Teens are faced with pressures of being judged by your peers for how you present yourself; following current fashions; possessing the trendy things; and hanging out with the ""in crowd."" Here's a ""secret"" that might help with most of those issues: Not much of those problems I've just described will really matter as they might seem to right now, in the real world. If you are feeling depression because you feel you lack some of those things that are seen as important by others (like your peers), I can assure you that being someone who is kind; compassionate; understanding of another person's suffering; and the effort you make to be the best person you can become in the world, will far outweigh anything you experienced in your teen years.When we are young, we judge everything based on what our peers have, what they say, the way they dress, who's popular, who's not popular, and for the most of it, all of that is external. So the question becomes, are you trying to fix the feelings on the inside (the internal stuff), with the trappings of all the stuff on the outside (the internal)? That is to say, do you feel that if you had what your friends have, you would be happy and less depressed? Depression is usually a symptom of something much bigger, it is not typically a problem by itself (just as a person who experiences a high temperature may likely have a cold). So fixing the symptom requires looking at the possible causes. In your post, you mentioned that you live with your dad. Are your parents divorced or separated, or has your mom passed away? Either of these circumstances could certainly cause depression. Finding out when you started feeling depressed, might be able to pinpoint the trigger that caused it, which requires looking at when you last felt really happy. It is also important to keep in mind, that as a teenager, your emotions are often being experienced very randomly, and sometimes without cause. It is part of your emotional development, but as you grow older can learn how to manage those emotions better and practice doing things that help you feel better (without causing harm to yourself).Have you tried talking to your dad about your feelings, or maybe another relative if you feel safer doing so? Do you have a friend who is your best friend...someone who is there for you no matter what? If not, there is a service you can use that is a national number for teens to talk with teen peer counselors. They are teens like yourself, but they have some insights that might be helpful. Its called Teen Line (https://teenlineonline.org/). It helped me when I was in my teens, and has helped lots of other teens as well. You might find a place to get some referrals to other local services in your area. If you want are in Washington state and would like to connect with me directly, you call link to me via my profile page. Or perhaps finding a counselor in your local area might be useful. Most towns and cities have some form of low cost counseling. You might also check with your school for assistance.Don't be afraid of not always knowing how you are supposed to feel. Adults don't always have a handle on it either. Being a teenager carries a lot stress, fear, and uncertainty. But you are not alone, and there is help if you reach out for it. I wish for you the very best, and bright future. ","Okay, this sounds like a really tough situation, and it's good you're reaching out and asking questions. It takes courage to do that. Let's break down what you've shared and talk about what might be going on, and how to get help.

**First, let's address the core of your concern: ""Are they right, am I depressed?""**

I am *not* a medical professional, so I cannot diagnose you. *Only* a qualified doctor or therapist can do that. However, what you're describing – the fluctuating desire to socialize, feelings of worthlessness, and believing you'll never do anything right – are *all* common symptoms of depression. 

Here's a little more detail on why those things connect to depression:

* **Withdrawing from friends & fluctuating social desire:**  Depression can make socializing feel exhausting, overwhelming, or pointless.  Sometimes you might *want* connection, but the energy to engage isn't there.  The back-and-forth you describe – wanting to connect, then shutting down – is very typical.  It's not that your friends are ""right"" to feel a certain way, it's that depression is influencing your behavior and feelings.
* **Feelings of worthlessness & self-criticism:**  These are *very* strong indicators of depression. Depression often distorts your thinking, making you focus on your perceived flaws and minimizing your strengths.  The idea that you're ""not worth knowing"" or ""never going to do anything right"" is the depression *talking*, not necessarily the truth.
* **Limited Social Life:** You mentioned only going out for classes. While having structure is good, a very limited social life, especially when it's coupled with wanting more connection at times, can contribute to and be a symptom of depression.



**It's important to understand:** Even if it *is* depression, it's **treatable**. It's not a sign of weakness, and you're not alone. Many, many people experience this.  



**Let's look at some other things that might be contributing, and then how to get help:**

* **Living Situation:** Living with your dad, especially in your late teens, can have its own pressures and dynamics.  Is it a supportive environment? Are there conflicts?  Even a well-meaning parent can sometimes unintentionally add to stress.
* **College Stress:** College is a big transition.  Academic pressure, figuring out your future, and adjusting to a new environment can be incredibly stressful.
* **Hormonal Changes:**  Late teens are still a time of significant hormonal changes, which can affect mood.
* **Underlying Anxiety:**  Sometimes depression and anxiety go hand-in-hand.  Anxiety can make social situations feel scary, leading to avoidance, which then reinforces feelings of isolation and worthlessness.
* **Lack of Routine & Purpose:**  If you're mostly at home and only going to classes, it's easy to fall into a rut.  Having a sense of purpose and some enjoyable activities can make a big difference.



**What should you do now? Here's a step-by-step approach:**

1. **Talk to Someone You Trust:** This could be your dad (if you feel comfortable), a relative, a teacher, a school counselor, or a trusted friend. Just *talking* about how you feel can be a huge relief.  Don't feel like you need to have all the answers; just expressing yourself is important.
2. **See a Doctor:**  This is the most important step.  Make an appointment with your primary care physician.  Explain how you've been feeling.  They can rule out any medical conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms and can refer you to a mental health professional (like a therapist or psychiatrist).  Don't be afraid to be honest. They are there to help, not judge.
3. **Consider School Counseling Services:**  Your college likely has a counseling center.  These services are often free or low-cost for students. They can provide therapy and support.
4. **Explore Online Resources:**  Here are a few helpful websites:
   * **The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI):** [https://www.nami.org/](https://www.nami.org/)
   * **The Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA):** [https://www.dbsalliance.org/](https://www.dbsalliance.org/)
   * **The Trevor Project:** (Specifically for LGBTQ youth, but offers excellent resources): [https://www.thetrevorproject.org/](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/)

I’m facing severe depression and anxiety and I just feel like I’m going through a lot. This really distracts me and I cant get my mind off the things that are bothering me.    How do I overcome this anxierty and depression?,Anxiety and depression are often linked. I don't consider them as diseases. Depression is a symptom of deep hurts to the sense of self that leaves a person feeling shamed. Anxiety is a symptom of not being given the proper emotional resources to handle the problems of life. It is also the result of being taught that life is a dangerous place that can't be managed.,"Okay, it takes a *lot* of courage to admit you're struggling with depression and anxiety, and I want to acknowledge that first. It's really good that you're reaching out, even just by writing this. It sounds incredibly difficult to be constantly bombarded by distressing thoughts, and it's understandable that it's impacting your ability to function.  I'm here to offer some support and guidance, but please read the **important disclaimer at the end** as I am not a substitute for professional help.

Here's a breakdown of strategies to help you navigate this, broken down into sections.  It's a lot, so don't feel you need to do everything at once.  Start small.  I'll also categorize things based on immediacy – things you can try *right now*, things to build in regularly, and things that require more sustained effort or professional help.

**I. Immediate Relief (When You're Actively Struggling - ""In the Moment"")**

These are things to try when the anxiety/depression feels overwhelming *right now*.

*   **Grounding Techniques:** These bring you back to the present moment.
    *   **5-4-3-2-1 Method:**  Name 5 things you can *see*, 4 things you can *touch*, 3 things you can *hear*, 2 things you can *smell*, and 1 thing you can *taste*.  Really focus on the details.
    *   **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system. Try box breathing: inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4. Repeat several times.
    *   **Physical Sensation:** Hold an ice cube, take a warm shower, or wrap yourself in a blanket.  Focus on the physical sensation.
*   **Distraction (Healthy Distraction):**  This isn’t avoidance, but a temporary break to give your brain a rest.
    *   **Listen to Music:**  Choose something calming or uplifting (avoid songs that reinforce negative feelings).
    *   **Watch Something Lighthearted:**  A funny video, a comforting movie, etc.
    *   **Engage Your Senses:**  Play with a pet, look at beautiful pictures, light a scented candle (safely!).
*   **Gentle Movement:**  Even a short walk or some stretching can release endorphins.  Don’t push yourself; just move a little.
*   **Reach Out (If Possible):**  Text a friend, family member, or someone you trust.  You don't have to go into detail; just saying ""I'm having a hard time"" can help.  (If you don't feel safe reaching out to someone you know, see the ""Resources"" section below).



**II. Building a Regular Routine (Daily/Weekly Habits)**

These are things to incorporate into your life consistently to build resilience.

*   **Prioritize Sleep:**  Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.  A regular sleep schedule is crucial.
*   **Nourishing Diet:**  Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.  Avoid excessive sugar, caffeine, and alcohol.  (It's okay to have treats, but moderation is key).
*   **Regular Exercise:**  Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.  Find something you enjoy!
*   **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  Even 5-10 minutes a day can make a difference. There are many apps (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer) that can guide you.
*   **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them.  Don't worry about grammar or structure; just let it flow.
*   **Social Connection:**  Make time for meaningful interactions with people you care about.  Even small connections can boost your mood.
*    **Limit Social Media:**  Often social media can exacerbate feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. Be mindful of your usage.
*   **Spend Time in Nature:**  Being outdoors has been shown to reduce stress and improve mood.
*   **Set Small, Achievable Goals:**  Break down large tasks into smaller steps.  Celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small.




**III.  Longer-Term Strategies & Professional Help (Essential for Lasting Change)**

These address the underlying causes of your depression and anxiety.

*   **Therapy:** This is *highly recommended*.  A therapist can help you:
    *   Identify and challenge negative thought patterns (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - CBT is very effective).
    *   Develop coping mechanisms.
    *   Process past trauma.
    *   Understand the root causes of your depression and anxiety.

"My husband and I have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. Others have told me that most men would have left me by now. Honestly, I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing. I want to be better connected with my husband.","It's encouraging that you say you want ""to be better connected with [your] husband,"" and since he hasn't left you, he must care about you and the relationship more than he does about just having sex. You don't say whether he complains or not, but even if he doesn't it seems there's a sense of something important missing for both of you.Most likely to connect better with him physically you'll need to become better connected with yourself and your body. Men often feel fulfilled by sex simply because it happened - the woman they want received them, allowed them to make love with her. For women that can sometimes be more complicated. A woman who loves sex most likely also loves her body, knows what pleasures her, and feels confident asking for what she wants. Self-pleasuring can be a way for you to discover more about your sexuality, and a classic resource is Betty Dodson's book Sex for One: The Joy of Selfloving. A good counselor or sex therapist can be very helpful with your whole relationship as well as the sexual part of it, but not all counselors are comfortable working with sexual issues. Shop around and be sure you find someone who can help you and your husband get better connected on all levels.","Okay, this is a really brave thing to acknowledge and address. It's incredibly common for sex to ebb and flow in long-term relationships, and a significantly low frequency like you describe *is* something to work on, but it absolutely doesn't mean your marriage is doomed. The fact that you *want* to be more connected with your husband is a huge and positive first step.  And honestly, the comments from others?  Ignore them. Every relationship is different, and their ""most men"" doesn't define your reality or your husband.

Here's a breakdown of things to consider, categorized for clarity.  This is a lot, so feel free to take it in pieces.  I'll try to be thorough.  I'll also add a disclaimer at the end.

**1. Understanding the Landscape: What Could Be Contributing?**

Let's explore the potential reasons, separating them a little for easier discussion.  It's likely a combination of factors.

*   **Your Sex Drive (Libido):** You mentioned you think yours is low. This is very common, and there are *many* reasons for it.
    *   **Physical Factors:**  Medical conditions (thyroid issues, hormonal imbalances, chronic pain, medication side effects - especially antidepressants), fatigue, childbirth (and postpartum recovery), menopause/perimenopause (even in your 30s it can start impacting libido) can all play a role.
    *   **Psychological Factors:** Stress, anxiety, depression, body image issues, past trauma, relationship dissatisfaction, and even just feeling overwhelmed with life can significantly lower desire.
    *   **Lifestyle Factors:**  Poor sleep, unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, and excessive alcohol consumption can all impact libido.
*   **His Experience and Needs:** It’s crucial to understand *his* perspective.  
    *   **Unmet Needs:** Is he feeling rejected?  Is his need for intimacy going unmet? (Intimacy isn't just about sex, but lack of *any* intimacy can contribute to this).
    *   **Expectations:** What are his expectations for sex in a marriage? Have those been communicated?
    *   **Pressure/Anxiety:** Is he feeling pressure to initiate, or feeling anxious about your responses?
*   **The Relationship Dynamic:**
    *   **Communication:**  This is huge.  Can you both talk openly and honestly about your feelings, needs, and desires – *without judgment*?  (We'll talk more about this below).
    *   **Emotional Connection:**  How strong is your emotional bond?  Do you feel close, supported, and understood?  Often, low sexual desire is linked to a lack of emotional intimacy.
    *   **Routine & Boredom:**  Has your sex life become predictable or nonexistent, leading to a lack of excitement?
    *   **Resentment:** Are there any underlying resentments or unresolved conflicts that are creating distance between you?
*   **Skill/Knowledge/Comfort:** You mentioned neither of you knowing what you're doing. This is *extremely* common!  Sex education is often lacking, and it's easy to fall into patterns that aren't particularly fulfilling.



**2. What You Can Do:  Practical Steps**

*   **Start with Non-Sexual Intimacy:**  Before even talking about sex, focus on building emotional connection.
    *   **Quality Time:**  Dedicated, focused time together – no phones, no TV.  Date nights, even if it's just a walk and a conversation.
    *   **Acts of Service:**  Do something thoughtful for him, and encourage him to do something for you.
    *   **Affection:**  Hugging, kissing, holding hands, cuddling – these are all important ways to build intimacy.  Do them *regularly*, not just when you're hoping for sex.
    *   **Express Appreciation:** Tell him what you appreciate about him.
*   **Have *The* Conversation (and then more conversations):** This will be the hardest part, but the most important.
    *   **Choose the Right Time & Place:**  Pick a calm, private setting where you won’t be interrupted.  *Not* right before or after a potential attempt at sex!
    *   **Start with ""I"" Statements:**  Instead of ""You never…,"" try ""I feel… when…""  For example, ""I feel disconnected when we don't spend quality time together.""
    *   **Be Honest & Vulnerable:**  Share your feelings about your libido, your anxieties, and your desire to improve the connection.
    *   **Ask Him About His Experience:**  ""How are *you* feeling about our intimacy?""  ""What are your needs and desires?""  ""What would make you feel"
"I'm a teenager and I get these really intense mood swings.    My mood will be really high and I'll think of something that I want to do. When I start to make it happen I get irritated by other people if they intervene. Then if the thing I wanted to do doesn't work out, I have these tendencies to blame other people for it not working out.    Can you explain what's going on?","Mood swings and getting frustrated when things don't work out is totally normal. Sometimes, we get tied to one thing we really want to do and it can feel pretty intense when that gets interrupted or doesn't work out. This said, you're coming to CounselChat and so I'm guessing this is something that is pretty intense for you and something that you are concerned about. If this is getting in the way of your life, it may be worthwhile to reach out to a therapist or doctor to get some help with this and see if there might be something more going on. While for most people frustration/mood swings is related to typical life and stress, if very intense it can be a sign of a number of challenges ranging from anxiety to a traumatic experience to something like Bipolar Disorder where a person's mood and energy might fly so high (mania) that one feels like they can do anything but often become frustrated when interrupted (note: there is a lot more to Bipolar Disorder than this and this is certainly not a diagnosis). Wish you well!","Okay, it's really good you're recognizing this pattern and asking about it. That takes self-awareness, and that's a fantastic first step. What you're describing definitely sounds like a challenging cycle, and it's not uncommon for teenagers to experience these kinds of intense emotional shifts. Here's a breakdown of what might be going on, covering the different parts of the cycle you described, and what areas could be contributing.  I'll break it down into sections to make it easier to follow.  **Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am not a substitute for professional advice.**

**1. The ""High"" and Intense Motivation:**

* **Teenage Brain Development:** Your brain is *still developing* – specifically the prefrontal cortex, which handles things like planning, impulse control, and emotional regulation. This means your brain is more prone to big swings in how you feel and what you want.  Dopamine (the ""reward"" chemical) can surge when you think of something exciting, making you feel incredibly motivated.
* **Seeking Novelty & Independence:**  Teenage years are about figuring out who you are and establishing independence.  Wanting to pursue things *you* choose, and feeling a strong drive to do them, is perfectly normal.
* **Idealistic Thinking:** You may be prone to imagining things going perfectly, and the anticipation of that success feels really good.

**2. Irritability When Interrupted:**

* **Executive Function Challenges:** That still-developing prefrontal cortex *also* makes it harder to shift gears when plans are interrupted. It's like your brain gets ""stuck"" on the task and sees interruptions as obstacles to your desired outcome. This can easily translate into irritation.
* **Sense of Ownership:** When you're really invested in something, it feels like *your* project, and outside input can feel like criticism or a threat to your autonomy.
* **Difficulty with Frustration Tolerance:**  Because emotional regulation isn't fully developed, it's harder to cope with even minor frustrations, like someone offering advice or needing your help with something else.
* **Possible Sensitivity to Rejection/Criticism:**  Even if the intervention isn’t meant as criticism, it might be *perceived* that way, triggering a defensive reaction (irritability).

**3. Blaming Others When Things Don't Go As Planned:**

* **Cognitive Distortions:** This is a big one.  ""Cognitive distortions"" are unhelpful thought patterns.  The one you're describing sounds like **externalizing blame.**  Instead of looking at what *you* could have done differently, or accepting that sometimes things just don't work out, you automatically attribute failure to others.  This feels easier in the moment, but it’s not helpful long-term.
* **Protecting Self-Esteem:** Blaming others can be a way to protect your self-esteem. If it's someone else's fault, you don't have to feel bad about yourself or acknowledge any personal shortcomings.
* **Lack of Perspective:** A developing brain can struggle with seeing the bigger picture.  You might focus narrowly on what went wrong and who you think caused it, without considering other factors.
* **Emotional Regulation (Again):**  When you're already feeling down about a setback, it's harder to think rationally and take responsibility. The emotional intensity overwhelms your ability to be objective.
* **Learned Behavior:**  Consider if this is a pattern you've observed in your family or environment.  Sometimes we unconsciously learn to blame others from the people around us.



**Putting It All Together: The Cycle**

What you're describing is a cycle:

1. **Excitement/Motivation** ->
2. **Intense Focus & Irritability when Interrupted** ->
3. **Setback/Disappointment** ->
4. **Blame & Resentment**  -> which can then lead back to seeking another 'high' to distract from negative feelings.

**What Can You Do?**

* **Self-Awareness (You're Already Doing This!):**  Continue to notice the pattern. The fact that you’re asking about this shows you're willing to look at your own behavior.
* **Practice Taking Responsibility:** This is *hard*, but it's key.  When something doesn't work out, try to identify *your* role in it, even if it's small.  Instead of ""My friend ruined everything,"" try ""I got frustrated when my friend offered help, and maybe I should have been more open to their suggestions.""
* **Challenge Your Thoughts:** When you feel the urge to blame, ask yourself:
    *  ""Is this thought 100% true? What's the evidence for and against it?"""
"I'm going through some things with my feelings and myself. I barely sleep and I do nothing but think about how I'm worthless and how I shouldn't be here.
   I've never tried or contemplated suicide. I've always wanted to fix my issues, but I never get around to it.
   How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?","You can, for sure... and the first step is to believe you are worthy TO YOURSELF. Recognizing you are in a quest is already a big first step. Taking the time to start figuring out who you are is definitely the next... do so with SELF COMPASSION and kindness. Know this is a process and just look forward for what you might find.  I do recommend you find someone to talk to (there are many options out there that can fit the situation you are in), and I also recommend you start by giving yourself the importance to invest some time and effort in this quest. YOU DESERVE IT. There are some excellent TED Talks you can google, great books you can read, or even joining a yoga practice, team or some kind of hobby may help. Anything that shows yourself you are worthy of this effort. Have patience and start!!!! the answer is out there waiting for you. Asking these questions already set you on the right path.","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult, and it takes a lot of courage to even *say* these things, so I want to acknowledge that right away.  You're carrying a heavy burden, and the fact that you're reaching out, even in this way, shows a spark of wanting things to be different.  That's important.  It's good you haven't acted on thoughts of ending your life, and it's good you *want* to fix things.  Let's try to unpack this a little, and I'll offer some suggestions, but please read the **important disclaimer at the end** because this isn't a substitute for professional help.

**Understanding What You're Describing**

What you're describing – persistent negative self-talk, feeling worthless, and difficulty sleeping – are common symptoms of depression and low self-esteem.  It's not a character flaw; it's a state of mind that can be changed, but it often requires effort and support.  The ""doing nothing but thinking"" is a sign that these thoughts are really dominating your mind, which is exhausting and can feel paralyzing.  The fact that you *want* to fix it, but struggle to *do* it, is also very typical of depression - it drains motivation and energy.

**Let's Break Down Changing the Feeling of Worthlessness**

It's a process, and it won't happen overnight.  Here's a breakdown of things you can try, categorized for clarity.  I'll also try to give some starting points that aren't overwhelming.

**1. Challenge the Negative Thoughts:**

*   **Thought Records:** This is a technique from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).  When you have a thought like ""I'm worthless,"" write it down. Then, challenge it. Ask yourself:
    *   Is there *evidence* for this thought?  Really, honestly?
    *   Is there *evidence against* this thought?  (This is often harder, but crucial).
    *   What's a more balanced or realistic way to look at this?
    *   What would I say to a friend who was saying this about themselves? (We're often much kinder to others than we are to ourselves).
*   **Identify Thought Patterns:**  Do you tend to engage in ""all-or-nothing"" thinking (e.g., ""If I'm not perfect, I'm a failure"")?  Do you catastrophize (""Everything is going to go wrong"")?  Recognizing these patterns can help you catch them as they happen.
*   **Don't Believe Everything You Think:**  Thoughts are just that – thoughts. They aren’t facts.  Just because you *think* something doesn't make it true.

**2. Small Actions, Big Impact (Building Self-Efficacy):**

*   **Start *Tiny*:** Because you're feeling paralyzed, don't aim for big changes immediately.  Instead of ""I need to fix my life,"" try ""I will get out of bed and brush my teeth.""  Or ""I will drink a glass of water."" Or ""I will open the curtains.""  These seem small, but they are *wins*.
*   **Make a ""Done"" List:** Instead of a to-do list, which can feel overwhelming, keep a ""done"" list.  Write down everything you accomplish, no matter how small. This provides visual proof that you *are* capable.
*   **Engage in One Enjoyable Activity:** Even if you don't *feel* like it, force yourself to do one thing you used to enjoy, even for 15 minutes.  Listen to music, read a chapter of a book, take a short walk. The goal isn't to feel ecstatic, just to interrupt the negative thought cycle.
* **Self-Compassion Break:** Kristin Neff has a wonderful exercise called a ""self-compassion break.""  You can find instructions here: [https://self-compassion.org/self-compassion-break/](https://self-compassion.org/self-compassion-break/)  It involves acknowledging your suffering, remembering common humanity (everyone struggles), and offering yourself kindness.

**3. Focus on Your Values:**

*   **What's Important to You?** What values do you hold dear? (Kindness, honesty, creativity, learning, helping others, etc.).  Often, feelings of worthlessness come from living out of alignment with our values.
*   **Small Value-Based Actions:** Can you do one small thing each day that aligns with one of your values?  If you value kindness, maybe send a thoughtful text to a friend. If you value learning, read an article about something that interests you.

"I think I'm annoying and bothersome, but my girlfriend says I'm just fine. I don't think so, I think I'm stressing everyone else out","I'm glad to hear you have friends and that your friends say they like you.Trust your own sense of who you are which tells you that something feels uneasy within yourself.Is the friend who says you're ""just fine"", very familiar with who you are?""Friend"" is a broad category.She may not know you as fully as you know yourself.Basically, it is possible to be ""fine"" and have some inner stress.Follow your own thoughts and observations to more fully learn about yourself in ways your friend may not notice or be aware.","Okay, this is a really common and tough feeling. It's good you're recognizing this and wanting to understand it better. It's *especially* good that your girlfriend says you're fine, but it's also understandable why you're still struggling if you feel differently. Here's a breakdown of what might be going on, and how to approach it, broken down into sections.  It's long, but I want to be thorough.

**1. Why You Might Feel This Way (Understanding the Root)**

* **Anxiety and Self-Perception:**  Often, feeling like a burden stems from anxiety.  Anxiety can distort your perception of how others see you. You might be hyper-focused on potential negative reactions and interpreting neutral things as signs of annoyance.  You're essentially predicting how people *might* react, rather than seeing how they *are* reacting.
* **Past Experiences:**  Have you had experiences in the past where you *were* made to feel like a burden?  Perhaps critical parents, bullying, or relationships where your needs weren't validated? These experiences can leave a lasting imprint and make you more sensitive to perceived rejection or annoyance.
* **High Standards for Yourself:**  Do you have very high expectations for yourself?  Do you feel like you constantly need to be ""doing"" something, or being ""helpful"" or ""interesting"" to be worthy of attention?  This can lead to overthinking and feeling like you're falling short.
* **Overthinking Interactions:**  You might replay conversations in your head, dissecting them for hidden meanings and signs of irritation. This is a classic anxiety habit, and rarely an accurate reflection of reality.
* **Sensitivity to Non-Verbal Cues:** You might be highly attuned to subtle non-verbal cues (facial expressions, body language) and misinterpret them.  Someone looking tired might not be annoyed with *you*; they might just be tired!
* **Underlying Issues:** Sometimes, feelings of worthlessness or inadequacy can contribute to believing you're a burden. If this feels deeper, it's worth exploring with a professional (see section 5).



**2. Why Your Girlfriend Says You're Fine (And Why to Consider That)**

* **She genuinely likes you:** This is the most obvious, but important. She's chosen to be with you.  People don't generally choose to be with people they find constantly annoying and burdensome.
* **She's being supportive:** She might see your good qualities and be trying to counteract your negative self-perception.
* **She *doesn't* perceive you as annoying:**  She might genuinely not notice the things you're worried about. Her perspective is different.  She sees the whole picture of you, not just the parts you're fixating on.
* **Healthy Relationships Involve Acceptance:** A healthy relationship means accepting each other, flaws and all. She likely accepts the parts of you that you're struggling with.

**Important Note:**  It's *vital* to believe that people are generally truthful. While people can be polite, consistently *telling* someone they're fine when they are causing significant stress would be unsustainable and unfair in the long run.




**3. What to Do About It - Practical Steps**

* **Challenge Your Thoughts:**  This is the core of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).  When you have a thought like, ""I'm stressing everyone out,"" ask yourself:
    * ""What evidence do I have for this thought?"" (Be honest!  Not just what *feels* true.)
    * ""What evidence contradicts this thought?"" (Your girlfriend's words are *strong* evidence!)
    * ""Is there another way to interpret this situation?""
    * ""What's the worst that could happen if I *was* being a bit annoying? Could I handle that?""
* **Observe, Don't Assume:** Instead of jumping to conclusions about how people are feeling, try to simply observe their behavior.  Notice their facial expressions, body language, and what they *say*.  Don't fill in the gaps with your anxieties.
* **Directly Ask (Carefully):**  This is tricky, but can be helpful.  Instead of saying ""Am I annoying you?"", try:  ""Hey, I've been feeling a little self-conscious lately, and I sometimes worry about being too much.  Would you mind letting me know if there's ever anything I do that bothers you? I promise I won't be upset, I just want to be aware.""  *Be prepared to genuinely listen and not get defensive.*  This is about gathering information, not seeking reassurance.
* **Focus on Reciprocity:** Are you giving *as much* as you're taking in your relationships?  Relationships are a two-way street"
"I was never single, afraid to be alone, and I looked for my boyfriend to make me happy. I finally worked on my self, was in a relationship, and I did everything a healthy girlfriend does and it didn't work out. Now months later, no man peaks my interest. Am I ready to date again? Is there a reason no one sparks my interest?","Yes, of course there's a reason!There's always a reason for most dynamics!Depending on the nature and qualities of what changed as a result of your new self realizations, you may be more deeply affected by your new awareness than how you imagined these would go.Since you already are on the best road possible for yourself, since this resulted from your own introspection, keep trusting your own self work as to what develops and at what pace your relationship attraction qualities grow.","Okay, this is a really insightful place to be, even if it *feels* confusing right now. It sounds like you've done a lot of really important work on yourself, and that's fantastic. Let's break down what's happening and explore both whether you're ready to date and why you might not be feeling that spark.

**First, let's acknowledge what you've already accomplished.** You recognized a pattern of needing a partner for happiness, and you actively worked to break that. You then *demonstrated* healthy relationship behaviors. That's huge. Many people talk about wanting to be better partners, but you actually *did* the work. Even though it didn't end with the outcome you hoped for, that doesn't invalidate your growth. In fact, it proves you *can* be healthy in a relationship.

**Are you ready to date again?**

Honestly, there's no magic ""yes"" or ""no"" answer.  Here's how to assess:

* **Are you okay being alone?** This is *the* key question. Not just ""not actively miserable,"" but genuinely content with your own company, your own life, and your own pursuits. It sounds like you've made strides here, and that's great. The fact that you're not jumping at every potential suitor is a *good* sign.
* **Are you dating because *you* want to, or because you feel like you *should*?** If you're feeling external pressure (from family, friends, society), or a lingering sense of ""I need to fill a void,"" you're probably not ready.  Dating should be about adding joy to an already fulfilling life, not *being* the fulfillment.
* **Do you have the emotional bandwidth?**  Breakups take time to process, even if you were the one who initiated it or saw it coming.  Are you still carrying a lot of emotional baggage?  If so, it's better to address that *before* bringing someone new into the mix.  You don't want to unintentionally project past hurts onto a new person.
* **Are you clear on your boundaries and needs?** Because you’ve done the work on yourself, you’re likely more clear than ever on what you want and don’t want in a partner. 

**If you answer ""yes"" to most of those, you *might* be ready to dip a toe in.  But it's okay to say ""not yet"" and continue focusing on yourself.**



**Now, let's tackle why no one is sparking your interest.** This is completely normal, *especially* after a period of self-discovery and a relationship that didn't work. Here are some possible reasons:

* **Your Standards Have (Healthily) Increased:** You've learned what you deserve and what you won't tolerate.  Before, you might have settled for someone who met a basic need (not being alone). Now, you're looking for someone who truly aligns with your values, supports your growth, and brings something special to your life.  That narrows the field considerably!  This is *good*.
* **You're Still Processing Grief:** Even if the relationship wasn't perfect, ending something is a loss. You're grieving the future you imagined, the connection you had, and the time invested.  Grief can dampen your enthusiasm for new connections.
* **You're Protecting Yourself:** Your heart might be saying, ""Remember how that last relationship felt? I'm going to be cautious!"" This is a natural self-protective mechanism.  You're subconsciously raising the bar to avoid getting hurt again.
* **You've Rediscovered Your Own Interests:** When you're focused on a relationship, it's easy to let your own hobbies and passions take a backseat.  Now that you're prioritizing yourself, you might be genuinely more engaged in your own life, and that’s filling you up in ways a relationship didn't.
* **You’re Seeing People More Clearly:** When you were seeking someone to *complete* you, you may have overlooked red flags or idealized potential partners. Now, with a stronger sense of self, you're probably more realistic and discerning.
* **The ""Right"" Person Isn't a Cure-All:** You've started to understand that a partner isn't responsible for your happiness. This shifts your expectations. You’re less likely to feel a “spark” based on the *promise* of happiness and more likely to look for genuine compatibility and connection.

**What can you do?**

* **Give yourself time.** Don't force it. There’s no timeline.
* **Continue focusing on your own life.** Pursue your passions, spend time with friends and family, and nurture your well-"
"When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. She is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but I am afraid she is stressing too much. I’m afraid it’s going to break her. I don't know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal.","It may be helpful to register for a class you can take together. I would recommend mindful meditation or yoga, just the two of you. Something you find time for in a weekly basis. Yoga is amazing in learning mindfulness and reducing stress. I use yoga and mindful techniques when working with children and recommend it to parents to engage with their children. Hope this helps.","Okay, this is a really common concern, and you're right to be attentive to it. It's great that you recognize this is a pattern and that you're worried about her well-being. A bright, high-achieving kid cracking under pressure is *very* common, and it sounds like you're picking up on a potential problem before it becomes a bigger one. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering whether to seek professional help, what you can do at home, and how to frame your approach.  I'll cover a lot, so feel free to skip to sections that resonate most.

**1. Is This ""Not Normal""?**

Let's normalize this a bit.  While a complete meltdown over seemingly small things *isn't ideal*, it's a sign of underlying anxiety, and anxiety is incredibly common, especially in high-achieving students. Here's why:

* **Perfectionism:** 4.0 students often have incredibly high standards for themselves. They might fear failure intensely, and even minor setbacks feel catastrophic.
* **Pressure (Real and Perceived):** The pressure to maintain a 4.0, get into a good college, please parents, etc., is enormous.  Sometimes they feel pressure *they* are putting on themselves, even if you aren't explicitly pushing them.
* **Difficulty with Emotional Regulation:**  Some kids simply haven't developed the skills to manage big emotions effectively. This is something that *can be learned*.
* **Underlying Anxiety:**  This could be generalized anxiety, social anxiety, or performance anxiety specifically.  The school stress is a trigger, but the anxiety may be present in other areas too.
* **All-or-Nothing Thinking:**  This is common in anxious individuals.  A ""B+"" isn't just a good grade; it's a *failure*.

So, while you're right to be concerned, it's not necessarily ""abnormal"" in the sense of being rare. It *is* a signal that she needs support.



**2. Should You Seek Professional Help? (This is the big question)**

**Yes, it's a very good idea to consider it.**  Here's a tiered approach to thinking about that:

* **Start with a conversation with the school counselor.** They are a great first point of contact. They can:
    * Offer insight into how she's presenting at school.
    * Rule out any specific school-related stressors that you might not be aware of (bullying, social issues, teacher conflicts).
    * Offer some initial strategies.
    * Help you decide if further evaluation is needed.
* **If the school counselor suggests it, or if you feel it's needed even *after* talking to the counselor, consider a professional evaluation.**  Here are the types of professionals who can help:
    * **Child Psychologist:**  Specializes in the emotional and behavioral development of children and adolescents.  Can provide therapy (talk therapy) and psychological testing.
    * **Child Therapist/Counselor (LPC, LMFT):**  Licensed professionals who provide therapy.  They can help her develop coping skills and manage her anxiety.
    * **Pediatrician:**  Your pediatrician can rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to her anxiety (though this is less common).  They can also provide referrals to mental health professionals.
    * **Psychiatrist (MD):**  A medical doctor who can prescribe medication if needed, but also provides therapy. (Medication is usually a last resort, but it can be helpful in some cases.)

**Don't hesitate to seek help.**  Early intervention is key.  It's far easier to address anxiety when it's manageable than to wait until it becomes debilitating.  Think of it like a broken bone – you wouldn't wait to see if it heals on its own; you'd get it checked out.




**3. What You Can Do at Home - Immediate Support**

These are things you can start doing *now*, even before a professional appointment:

* **Validate Her Feelings:**  This is HUGE.  Instead of saying ""It's not a big deal,"" say things like:
    * ""That sounds really upsetting.""
    * ""I can see why you're feeling so stressed.""
    * ""It's okay to feel anxious about this.""
    * ""It's frustrating when things don't go as planned.""
* **Active Listening:**  Really *listen* to what she's saying.  Put your phone down, make eye contact, and let her fully express herself without interrupting.  Ask clarifying questions like, ""Can you tell me more about what's making you feel this way?""
* **Help Her Reframe:**  Once she's calmed down"
"I'm fine when we start becoming intimate, but out of nowhere, I will get a flashback of what happened to me in the past. I start hysterically crying and freaking out when my boyfriend obviously has done nothing to hurt me.","Have you sought the support of a therapist really qualified in working through sexual trauma? It can take some work, but healing is possible. If you feel able to, it may also help to open a dialogue with your boyfriend about what you need from him when you have these flashbacks. Let him know what some helpful responses may be. ","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult and understandably distressing for both you and your boyfriend. It's really good that you're recognizing this pattern and trying to understand it.  Here's a breakdown of what's likely happening, why, and what you can do, broken down into sections.  I'm going to cover a lot, so please read through it all.  **Please also see the Disclaimer at the very end, as this is not a substitute for professional help.**

**1. Understanding What's Happening: It's Likely Trauma-Related**

What you're describing strongly suggests you're experiencing **trauma responses**, specifically **flashbacks** and potentially **emotional flooding**. Here's a more detailed look:

* **Flashbacks:** These aren't just *memories* of a past event. They are *re-experiencing* the event as if it's happening again *in the present*.  Your brain, for a brief period, loses the ability to distinguish between past and present. This can involve sights, sounds, smells, physical sensations, and intense emotions.  Even if logically you *know* you're safe with your current boyfriend, the flashback feels intensely real.
* **Emotional Flooding:**  This happens when your nervous system gets overwhelmed by intense emotions (fear, panic, sadness, shame, etc.). It's like a dam breaking, and you're unable to regulate the intensity of your feelings.  Hysterical crying is a very common manifestation of emotional flooding.
* **Triggers:**  Intimacy, even positive intimacy, can be a trigger. This is because past trauma, especially trauma involving betrayal, loss of control, or physical/emotional harm, can become associated with sensations of closeness, vulnerability, and physical touch. Your brain might misinterpret the current intimacy as a re-enactment of the past trauma. It's *not* that your boyfriend is causing this; he's unknowingly activating a pre-existing, deeply ingrained response.
* **Dissociation:** Sometimes, flashbacks are accompanied by dissociation – feeling detached from your body, your emotions, or reality itself.  This can be a protective mechanism the brain uses to cope with overwhelming trauma.



**2. Why This Is Happening (Possible Causes)**

While I can't diagnose you, here are some common roots of these reactions, especially in the context of intimacy:

* **Past Trauma:** This is the most likely cause. This could include:
    * **Sexual Assault/Abuse:** Even if the abuse wasn't directly during sexual activity, any past sexual trauma can impact future intimacy.
    * **Emotional Abuse:**  Experiences of control, manipulation, or invalidation can create deep-seated fears around vulnerability and trust.
    * **Physical Abuse:**  Past physical harm can make physical touch feel unsafe, even in loving contexts.
    * **Childhood Trauma:**  Neglect, witnessing domestic violence, or other adverse childhood experiences can significantly impact emotional regulation and attachment.
    * **Other Traumatic Events:**  Any deeply distressing event (accident, loss, witnessing violence) can leave a lasting impact.
* **Attachment Issues:** Early childhood experiences with caregivers can shape how you form attachments in adulthood. Insecure attachment styles (anxious, avoidant, or disorganized) can make intimacy feel particularly scary or destabilizing.
* **Complex PTSD (C-PTSD):** This develops from prolonged or repeated trauma, often in childhood. C-PTSD often involves difficulties with emotional regulation, self-perception, and relationships.




**3. What You Can Do:  A Multi-Pronged Approach**

This isn’t something you can just “will” yourself out of. It requires compassion, patience, and active work.

* **Therapy is Crucial:** *This is the most important step.*  A therapist specializing in trauma (look for modalities like EMDR, Somatic Experiencing, Trauma-Focused CBT, or Internal Family Systems) can help you:
    * **Process the Trauma:**  Safely explore the past events and their impact on you.
    * **Develop Coping Mechanisms:**  Learn skills to manage flashbacks, emotional flooding, and triggers.
    * **Re-regulate Your Nervous System:**  Techniques to calm your body and mind when you're triggered.
    * **Challenge Negative Beliefs:**  Address any distorted beliefs about yourself and intimacy that stem from the trauma.
    * **Build Healthy Attachment:**  Work towards secure and fulfilling relationships.
* **Communicate with Your Boyfriend (With Boundaries):**  This is hard, but important.
    * **Explain What's Happening:**  Help him understand that his actions are *not* causing this.  Explain that it's a reaction to past trauma.  Using the language of ""flashback"" and ""trauma response"" can be helpful."
"I've hit my head on walls and floors ever since I was young. I sometimes still do it but I don't exactly know why,    I have anxiety and I had a rough childhood but now I'll start to hit my head and sometimes not realize it but I don't know how to stop or even why I'm doing it.    How can I help myself to change my behavior?","The best way to handle anxiety of this level is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor, and therapy to help you understand the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are causing the anxiety. This is not something that anyone should just “white knuckle” and try to get through on their own with no help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety. This takes a therapist trained in CBT. You will learn to recognize when and why you perform the behavior of hitting your head, help you deal with the underlying cause of this, and replace the behavior with a more positive behavior. You'll learn coping skills.You mention having a rough childhood. Anyone who has experienced trauma like this, especially long-term ongoing trauma from abuse of any kind, definitely does not need ""exposure therapy"", which is what is recommended for phobias. You need a therapist trained specifically in trauma informed therapy.You are on the right path by recognizing there is an issue and what it is. Good luck with your healing journey!","Okay, this sounds really difficult and it's good you're reaching out and wanting to understand and change this behavior.  Hitting your head, especially with a history going back to childhood, and coupled with anxiety and a rough upbringing, is a complex issue. It's *really* important to approach this with self-compassion and a focus on getting the right kind of support. Here's a breakdown of potential reasons, and a lot of ideas for how to help yourself, broken down into steps.  I'll also emphasize the need for professional help at the end.

**First: Understanding What Might Be Happening**

It's great you're recognizing this happens, even if you don't always realize it *in the moment*. Here are some possibilities contributing to this behavior:

* **Self-Soothing/Regulation:**  This is a common reason. When overwhelmed with anxiety, stress, or difficult emotions, people sometimes engage in behaviors that provide a physical sensation.  The impact of hitting your head can be a temporary distraction from emotional pain, a way to feel *something* when feeling numb, or even a subconscious attempt to ""ground"" yourself (though a very harmful way to do so).
* **Trauma Response:** A rough childhood often involves trauma.  Head-hitting can be a manifestation of trauma held in the body.  The body can react to triggers (even subtle ones) as if it's reliving the past, and this can lead to these kinds of behaviors.  It can be a way of trying to regain control when feeling helpless, or a re-enactment of experiences from the past.
* **Dissociation:** When anxiety is very high, or when someone has experienced trauma, they can dissociate – feel detached from their body or reality.  You mentioned not always realizing you're doing it, which *could* be linked to dissociation.  The behavior happens almost ""outside"" of your conscious awareness.
* **Emotional Release:** Sometimes, the physical sensation is a way to release pent-up anger, frustration, or sadness.  It's not a healthy release, but it can feel momentarily relieving.
* **Underlying Neurological Factors:** While less common, it's worth mentioning that sometimes repetitive behaviors can have a neurological component.  This is why professional evaluation is important.
* **Habit/Learned Behavior:** Because this has been happening for a long time, it may have become a deeply ingrained habit, even if the original reason is no longer consciously present.



**Second: Immediate Steps You Can Take (Self-Help)**

These are things you can start doing *now* to try and interrupt the behavior:

* **Awareness is Key:** You've already started this!  Pay attention to *when* it happens.  Keep a journal (even just notes on your phone) for a week or two.  Record:
    * **Time of day**
    * **What were you doing immediately before?**
    * **What were you thinking/feeling?** (Be specific:  ""Anxious about work,"" ""Feeling overwhelmed,"" ""Remembered something upsetting,"" ""Just felt empty."")
    * **Where were you?** (Certain environments might be triggers).
    * **How intense was the urge to hit your head?** (Scale of 1-10)
    * **Did you actually hit your head? If so, how hard?**
* **Identify Triggers:** After a week or two of journaling, look for patterns. What situations, thoughts, feelings, or places seem to precede the behavior?
* **Interrupt the Impulse:**  This is about breaking the chain reaction. When you feel the urge coming on:
    * **The ""5-4-3-2-1"" Grounding Technique:**  Name 5 things you can *see*, 4 things you can *touch*, 3 things you can *hear*, 2 things you can *smell*, and 1 thing you can *taste*.  This pulls you into the present moment.
    * **Physical Alternatives:**  Immediately do something *else* physical, but safe:
        * **Squeeze a stress ball.**
        * **Clench and release your fists.**
        * **Tap your feet.**
        * **Push your hands together hard.**
        * **Take deep, slow breaths** (focusing on the sensation of your breath).
        * **Wrap yourself in a blanket** (firm pressure can be grounding).
    * **Verbalize:**  Say out loud, ""I am feeling the urge to hit my head. I can get through this.""  (Even if it feels silly, it can help).
* **Create a Safe Space:**  If possible, remove yourself from triggering situations.  If you're in a place where you're likely to hit your head, move to a"
"My husband and I had our first threesome recently. Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me.    He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better, and now I'm craving more of it. But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling. Why am I feeling this way?","You need to have an honest conversation with each other about WHY you both want a threesome. Evaluate the status of your relationship with each other. Are you having issues? Fighting? Not feeling satisfied with each other? How has your sex life been with each other?  If there are any problems, insecurities, issues, introducing something like this may only make your relationship worse. Open relationships and threesomes rarely work out well. Sure, there are some who successfully live this lifestyle, but it only works when both people are completely secure in their relationship with each other, harbor no jealousies or insecurities, and aren't looking to someone else to satisfy needs that aren't getting met by their spouse. Let me say that again: This is not likely to work out well for you if either of you are insecure, jealous, or looking to have needs met by this other person that you aren't getting from your spouse. That empty feeling you're having - listen to it. Dig deep to find out where it is coming from. What thoughts are going through your head when you feel that way? You'll get the answer.The other thing that helps make something like this work is for both of you to listen and respect each other. If you don't like it that he paid more attention to the other girl, he needs to know that, and he needs to respect that.  If you're going to do it again, he needs to know what you're comfortable with and what you want. Set the limits before you're in the moment, before it's too late to take an action back. Turn it around and ask him what he would be comfortable with if it were a man instead of a woman.It is perfectly natural to be curious and want to experiment. A lot of people get that out of the way before settling down in a monogamous relationship. People who marry young and/or inexperienced may still feel that curiosity about things like that and want to experience them, but don't want to hurt their spouse. The REASON you are both doing this matters a lot. If there are problems in your relationship, this is likely to only make things worse.","Okay, this is a really common and complex experience, and it's good you're taking the time to explore your feelings. It's great that you and your husband communicated afterward, and that talking helped initially. The fact that you're now experiencing this ""empty feeling"" *before* things get close is a significant clue and deserves attention. Here's a breakdown of potential reasons, broken down into categories, along with things to consider.  I will also include a disclaimer at the end.

**1. Emotional Complexity of Opening a Relationship (Even for One Time):**

* **Core Beliefs & Values:** Even if you intellectually agreed to a threesome, it can challenge deeply held beliefs about monogamy, intimacy, and your relationship. That challenge can manifest as anxiety or emptiness.  This isn't about ""right"" or ""wrong"" beliefs, just *your* beliefs.
* **Unmet Needs:** Sometimes, exploring outside the relationship highlights unmet needs *within* the relationship.  The desire for more isn't necessarily about *her*, but about something missing in your connection with your husband.
* **Vulnerability & Control:**  Sharing intimacy with another person, even with your husband present, is incredibly vulnerable.  The empty feeling could be a response to that vulnerability, a feeling of losing some control, or a fear of not being ""enough.""
* **Social Conditioning:**  We're often raised with societal scripts about relationships.  Stepping outside those scripts can create internal conflict.
* **Jealousy (Even if Not Obvious):** Jealousy doesn't always look like anger. It can manifest as sadness, emptiness, or withdrawal.  You might not be jealous *of* her, but of the experience your husband had with her, or the connection they shared.

**2. Dynamics of the Experience Itself:**

* **Unequal Attention:** You specifically mentioned he was on her more than you. This is *very* important. It's understandable to feel empty if you felt overlooked or less desired during the experience. Even if you enjoyed it, feeling like an afterthought can be deeply hurtful.  This is likely a huge component of your current feelings.
* **Alcohol's Role:** Alcohol lowers inhibitions, but it also impairs communication and can distort perceptions. It's possible you overlooked feelings *during* the experience that are now surfacing. It can also lead to impulsive behavior and dynamics you wouldn't normally engage in.
* **Expectations vs. Reality:**  You may have had certain expectations about how the threesome would unfold, and the reality didn't match. This can lead to disappointment and emptiness.
* **Power Dynamics:**  Consider the power dynamics at play. Was the situation truly equal and consensual for everyone involved? Imbalances can create discomfort and negative feelings.

**3. Your Individual Psychology:**

* **Attachment Style:**  Your attachment style (how you form emotional bonds) can influence your reaction.  If you have an anxious attachment style, you might be more prone to feeling insecure or abandoned. If you have an avoidant style, you might be pushing away feelings of intimacy.
* **Self-Esteem:**  How you feel about yourself can play a role.  If you struggle with self-esteem, you might internalize any perceived lack of attention as a reflection of your worth.
* **Past Trauma:**  Past experiences with intimacy, rejection, or betrayal can be triggered by opening the relationship, even if the threesome itself wasn't traumatic.



**Why the Feeling *Before* it Gets Close?**

This is key. The anticipation is where your anxiety is building.  Here's why:

* **Fear of Repeating the Imbalance:** You're likely anticipating a repeat of the dynamic where your husband focuses more on the other person, and the thought of that is causing the emptiness.
* **Fear of Vulnerability:** You're bracing yourself for the vulnerability that comes with sharing intimacy.
* **Internal Conflict:** Your subconscious is picking up on the internal conflict between wanting the experience and feeling uneasy about it.
* **Loss of Control:** You may feel like you're losing control of the situation, or of your husband's attention.




**What to Do Next:**

1. **Deepen the Conversation with Your Husband:**  This is *crucial*. Don't just say ""I'm feeling empty."" Be specific.
    *  ""I've been thinking about our experience, and I felt a little overlooked when you were with her.  It made me feel [describe the feeling - unimportant, less desired, etc.].  I want to explore this further, but I need to know we can address that.""
    *  ""I'm noticing I feel anxious as we get closer to potentially doing this again.  I think it's because I'm worried about the dynamic being unbalanced again."""
"I'm in my mid 20s with a husband and children. I love my family, but I feel like I've lost my identity, and I don't know who I am other than a mom and wife. At times, all I can think is what I gave up and how I feel unhappy and trapped, but I know I'd feel like worse without them. I loathe myself at times. I have an amazing life, so why can't I just enjoy it?","It is not easy being a wife and mother. You have shifted roles in your life. You went from having a career to focusing on your family. Transitioning can be hard, especially when we feel we gave something up that we really wanted. I want to acknowledge you for wanting to be the best wife and mother you can. I think it is great that you are self-aware and want to work on this.Feeling ""unhappy and trapped"" may also mean that you are  believing these negative thoughts are absolutely true. We have lots and lots of thoughts throughout the day. Sometimes we pay a lot of attention to some and some we ignore. Right now these thoughts are getting a lot of your attention and perhaps you are thinking because you are thinking them they are true.  Is it really true that you trapped? You also said that you have an amazing life. It doesn't sound like you are only having negative thoughts. You have some positive ones, too. However, you are giving a lot of weight to the negative thoughts, more weight than the positive ones.I also wonder if you are struggling with the fact that you are even having this thought. One thing that can be helpful is to recognize that you are having a thought, that it is a negative thought, that thinking it does not make it true, and to let it go. This is the basis for mindfulness work that can be really helpful. It is a great place for you to start so you can balance out your thoughts and emotions.Best of luck to you!","Okay, this is *incredibly* common, and you are absolutely not alone in feeling this way. It sounds like you're experiencing a classic case of what's often called ""matrescence"" - the process of becoming a mother, which is a huge identity shift, and often isn't talked about enough. It's not just about the physical changes, it's a complete rewiring of your life and sense of self. And layered on top of that is being a wife, and navigating all that entails. It's a lot.

It's also *very* telling that you recognize how amazing your life is *and* you're struggling with these feelings. That awareness is important. The fact that you feel guilt on top of the unhappiness is also completely normal.  You're a good person, clearly.  But ""good"" doesn't equal ""happy"" or ""fulfilled"". Let's break down what you're describing and talk about some things that might help.



**1. Understanding What's Happening:**

* **Identity Loss:**  Before kids, you were an individual with dreams, hobbies, ambitions, and a defined sense of self.  Those things didn't disappear, but they've likely been put on the back burner. It's easy to get completely absorbed in the roles of wife and mother, and suddenly feel like those are *all* you are. Your brain has adapted to prioritize these roles, and it's a really powerful biological and social shift.
* **Grief (Even if It Doesn't Feel Like ""Traditional"" Grief):** You *did* give things up.  Spontaneity, career paths, personal time, even just the freedom to decide what *you* want to do on a whim. It’s okay to grieve those things. It doesn’t mean you regret your choices, it just means you acknowledge the loss.  It's a normal part of adjustment.
* **The ""Shoulds"":** You're feeling pressure – both internal and potentially external – to be a ""happy mom"" who loves every minute. Social media often contributes to this unrealistic expectation. When you don't feel that way, it leads to guilt and self-loathing.
* **Hormonal Shifts:** Postpartum hormones can linger and affect mood for a long time. Even if your children are no longer babies, hormonal fluctuations can play a role in your emotional well-being.
* **Trapped Feeling:**  The daily grind of childcare, household responsibilities, and potentially work (if you work outside the home) can feel incredibly restrictive.



**2. Why You Can't ""Just Enjoy It"":**

You *can't* just flip a switch and be happy when you're dealing with an identity crisis and unprocessed grief. It's not a matter of willpower. Your feelings are valid.  Telling yourself to ""just enjoy it"" is like telling someone with a broken leg to just walk. It's unhelpful and invalidating. 



**3. What Can You Do? (Practical Steps)**

This is where it gets into actionable things.  These aren't quick fixes, but rather steps to rebuild your sense of self.

* **Therapy:** *Seriously*. This is the most important recommendation. A therapist can provide a safe, non-judgmental space to explore your feelings, process your grief, and develop coping mechanisms.  Look for someone specializing in postpartum issues, maternal mental health, or identity exploration.  (Postpartum doesn't mean *immediately* after birth, it can be years later as you adjust to long-term motherhood).
* **Rediscover Your Interests:**  Think back to who you were *before* kids. What did you enjoy? What made you feel passionate?  Start small.  It could be reading, painting, writing, hiking, gardening, a book club, learning an instrument... anything.  Schedule it into your week – even 30 minutes.  Treat it like an important appointment.
* **Small Acts of Self-Care (That Aren't Just Bubble Baths):**  While bubble baths are nice, self-care needs to be deeper. It's about things that nourish your *soul*, not just your body. This might mean:
    * **Saying ""No"":**  Protect your time and energy.  You don't have to volunteer for everything, attend every event, or constantly put others' needs before your own.
    * **Alone Time:**  Even 15-20 minutes a day of quiet solitude can make a huge difference.  Go for a walk, meditate, listen to music, or just sit and breathe.
    * **Physical Activity:**  Exercise is a powerful mood booster.  Find something you enjoy, even if it's just walking around the block.
    * **Creative Expression:**  Eng"
I am going through a very hard time and I'm so depressed. My parents are getting a divorce and a lot of bad things are happening. I want to lull myself.,"It sounds like a tough time and it's normal to feel down when your family is going through a divorce or other hardship. There's a difference between feelings like sadness, discouragement, grief, loneliness and depression, though. Sadness is sadness and sometimes we have to go through a grieving or other process, that is a normal reaction to events in our lives. Depression, on the other hand, is more about being stuck. Lulling yourself with self-care sounds like a healthy response and a way to give yourself support. So as to the uncomfortable but healthy part of your feelings, do the best you can to put names to it and share with a trusted other person. You will find comfort. The part of your situation that's depression -- feeling stuck, not able to get out of bad, concentrate, changes in sleeping and eating, loss of enjoyment in living, poor hygiene, feelings of hopelessness, that's different. First step, identify your own symptoms of depression. If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself, tell someone. If you're not sure, you can try 800-lifenet or other support line to get feedback. First aid for depression includes: daily care and feeding, good sleeping and eating, lots of exercise--even when you don't feel like it-- healthy socializing, and focusing on talking to yourself in a positive way. If you aren't able to move yourself out of your depression,  work with a professional to make short-term goals and get some support. You may also talk to your doctor or psychiatrist about trying an anti-depressant to give you a little lift while you go through a rough patch.Best wishes,Karen","Okay, it sounds like you're going through an incredibly difficult time. Your parents' divorce *and* other bad things happening on top of that is a huge amount to handle, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling depressed.  It takes a lot of courage to even reach out and say you're struggling, so I want to acknowledge that strength in you.

I'm really concerned about your use of the word ""lull"" - and I want to be very direct. It sounds like you might be thinking about ways to numb your pain, to escape from these feelings.  When people talk about wanting to ""lull"" themselves when they're in intense emotional pain, it can sometimes be a way of talking about wanting to self-harm or even end their life.  **Please know that you are not alone, and there are people who want to help you through this, and you deserve to feel better.**

I am an AI and cannot provide mental health support, but I can provide resources and strongly encourage you to reach out for help *right now*.  Here's a breakdown of why what you're feeling is serious and where to turn:

**Why this is serious:**

* **Divorce is incredibly stressful:** Even when it's the right decision for your parents, it's a massive life change that brings a lot of grief, uncertainty, and emotional turmoil for everyone involved, especially children.
* **Combined with other bad things:** Having multiple negative things happening at once compounds the stress and makes it much harder to cope.
* **Depression is a real illness:** It's not a sign of weakness, and it's not something you can just ""snap out of."" It changes how your brain works and makes it difficult to experience joy or even basic functioning.
* **Wanting to ""lull"" yourself is a warning sign:**  This suggests you're overwhelmed and looking for a way to escape intense pain, which can be dangerous.

Would you like me to help you find resources specific to dealing with parental divorce?  Or perhaps help you practice a simple breathing exercise"
I've been with the mother of my child for years.,I would think that you hold little self worth and feel that you are not worthy of better.  I would suggest that you get to know yourself.   What do you NEED in a relationship?  What is holding you to this relationship other than your child?  What have gone on in the relationship that makes you think or feel you deserve such disrespect?  Just a few questions to ask yourself..,"Okay. That's a significant statement, and it sounds like you might be navigating a complex situation.  It's good you're reaching out, even if just to start talking.  To help me understand how I can *best* help you, could you tell me a little more about what's on your mind?  I understand you may not want to share everything, and that's okay.  But even a little more information will help me tailor my response.  For example, are you:

* **Generally doing well and just reflecting?**  Sometimes people just want to talk about their long-term relationship with a co-parent.
* **Facing a specific challenge?**  Like communication issues, disagreements about parenting, financial strain, or changes in your relationship?
* **Considering a change in your relationship?** Are you thinking about separation or divorce?
* **Dealing with emotional difficulties?**  Like stress, anxiety, sadness, or anger?
* **Looking for advice on a particular topic?** (e.g., co-parenting, communication strategies, legal considerations)

Here are some general areas I can offer support with, depending on what you're going through:

* **Communication:**  Improving how you talk to each other, especially regarding your child.
* **Co-Parenting:** Strategies for raising your child effectively even if your relationship changes.
* **Emotional Support:**  A space to vent and process your feelings.  (Though I am an AI and can't offer therapy.)
* **Information:**  Pointing you to resources like legal aid, mediation services, or parenting support groups.
* **Brainstorming:**  Helping you think through options and potential solutions.



**Please know that I am an AI and cannot provide legal or therapeutic advice.** My purpose is to offer information and support based on the input you provide.  If you are in crisis, please reach out to a crisis hotline (see resources at the end).

**To start, perhaps you could tell me:**

* **How long have you been together?** (Roughly is fine - years, decades, etc.)
* **How old is your child/children?**
* **What's the main thing you want to talk about today?** (Even just ""I'm stressed"" is a good starting point.)

"I've got so much anger. I don't know how to control myself. My girlfriend screams at me all the time, and sometime I don't know how to deal with life. I'm very depressed and angry. I feel lost.","Hi Campbell River, You say you have anger but you don't mention how it shows. Or maybe it doesn't. Are you aggressive with your girlfriend? Since you mention depression, I wonder if you're bottling it all up somewhere instead of letting it show at all. If this is the case, I admire your ability to not lash out at someone who's hurting you. However, if they are totally  unexpressed, anger turn inward and shift into depression. When she yells at you, what do you do? Is this the moment that you feel the most angry? I wouldn't be surprised; anger is a normal response to someone yelling at you. Something about anger...it's often there to cover up our more vulnerable emotions. Under the anger I wonder if you feel worthless, powerless, scared, unloved. Part of the trick to reducing anger is identifying those other emotions and expressing them. You say you don't know how to deal with life, and I think maybe you mean you don't know how to deal with emotions. Lots of people don't! This is confusing for most of us. What am I feeling? Why is it so strong? I'm afraid to express it for fear of hurting someone (or falling apart, or feeling alone...). How do I know what to express and what to be quiet about? These are all great questions to ask yourself, and a qualified therapist can help you sort it all out and support you in your growth. I wish you well!","Okay, that sounds incredibly difficult. It takes a lot of courage to admit you're struggling with anger, depression, and feeling lost, so thank you for sharing that. It's clear you're in a lot of pain, and it's completely understandable why you're feeling overwhelmed.  Let's break this down and talk about some things that might help.  I'm going to give you a lot of information, and I'll try to organize it.  Please read through it all, and at the end, I'll emphasize the *most important* thing to do.

**First, let's acknowledge what you're experiencing.**

* **Anger:** Anger is often a *secondary* emotion. It often masks underlying feelings like hurt, fear, frustration, or sadness. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of those underneath.  It's not about *having* anger, it's about *how* you express it and what's causing it.
* **Depression:** Depression isn't just feeling sad. It can manifest as irritability, loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, changes in sleep or appetite, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and even physical pain.  It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of these.
* **Feeling Lost:** This often comes with depression and difficult life circumstances.  It's a sense of not knowing your purpose, direction, or how to navigate your life.
* **Your Girlfriend's Behavior:** Being constantly screamed *at* is emotionally abusive.  It's damaging and creates a hostile environment.  No one deserves that, and it's contributing significantly to your stress and likely exacerbating your anger and depression.  This is a *critical* piece of this puzzle.



**Let's talk about dealing with the anger.**

Here are some techniques, but *these are tools to help you manage while you address the root causes* (which we'll get to):

* **Recognize Your Triggers:** What situations, words, or behaviors from your girlfriend specifically set you off?  Knowing your triggers is the first step in managing your reactions.
* **Early Warning Signs:**  What happens *before* you get to the point of feeling overwhelmed? Do you feel your heart racing?  Muscles tense?  Jaw clench?  Recognizing these early signs allows you to intervene.
* **Cool-Down Techniques (in the moment):**
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system.  Try the 4-7-8 technique: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8.
    * **Take a Time Out:**  Remove yourself from the situation.  Go to another room.  Go for a walk.  Tell your girlfriend (calmly, if possible) that you need a break. *This is not giving in, it's self-preservation.*
    * **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** Tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body.
    * **Grounding Techniques:**  Focus on your senses.  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
* **Long-Term Strategies:**
    * **Exercise:**  Physical activity is a great stress reliever.
    * **Journaling:**  Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them.
    * **Mindfulness/Meditation:**  These practices can help you become more aware of your emotions and reactions without judgment.
    * **Healthy Diet:**  What you eat affects your mood.
    * **Adequate Sleep:**  Lack of sleep makes everything worse.



**Now, let's address the depression and feeling lost.**

* **Professional Help is Crucial:**  I'm going to say this again later, but it's the most important thing. A therapist can help you:
    * **Identify the root causes of your depression.**
    * **Develop coping mechanisms.**
    * **Process your emotions in a healthy way.**
    * **Explore your values and goals to find a sense of purpose.**
    * **Address the impact of the abusive dynamic with your girlfriend.**
* **Small Steps:** When you're depressed, even small tasks can feel overwhelming.  Break things down into smaller, more manageable steps.  Celebrate small victories.
* **Reconnect with Activities You Enjoy:**  Even if you don't *feel* like it, try to do something you used to enjoy, even for a short period.
* **Social Connection:**  Spend time with supportive friends and family.  Isolation can worsen depression.
* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself.  You're going through a lot.  Treat yourself"
Does counseling really do anything that can help people?,"Hi!  Great question.  I believe counseling does help people! Of course, I am a therapist, so I would think that! :)  Seriously - I think therapy and counseling allow us to understand ourselves, our motivations and the things that bring us happiness and discontent.  Therapy can create opportunities to try new skills and enhance positive attributes that are already present in someone.  I like to think of therapy as an unbiased ""aerial view"" of our lives. Someone outside can often help us notice things we might otherwise miss. Hope this helps!","Okay, let's break down the big question of whether counseling really helps. It's a really valid question, and the answer is... complex, but generally **yes, counseling can be very helpful for a lot of people.** However, it's not a magic bullet, and the *how* and *for whom* are important. Here's a comprehensive look, covering the evidence, what it helps with, factors influencing effectiveness, and things to keep in mind:

**1. The Evidence Base: Does it work, scientifically?**

* **Extensive Research:** There's a *huge* body of research on the effectiveness of counseling (also often called psychotherapy).  It's been studied for decades.
* **Effect Sizes:**  The good news is that, on average, counseling *does* produce positive change.  ""Effect size"" is a way researchers measure how much a treatment works.  Counseling generally falls into the ""small to medium"" effect size range.  This means it's not a dramatic overhaul for everyone, but it's a meaningful improvement for many.  To put it in perspective, effect sizes for many medical interventions (like some medications) are similar.
* **Specific Therapies & Conditions:**  Certain types of therapy have been proven particularly effective for specific conditions. (See section 2)
* **Neuroscience Support:**  Neuroscience is starting to show *how* counseling can lead to changes in the brain.  For example, therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) have been shown to impact brain areas related to emotional regulation and thought patterns.
* **Meta-Analyses:**  Researchers often combine the results of many studies (meta-analysis) to get a more robust picture. Meta-analyses consistently show that therapy is more effective than no treatment.
* **Long-Term Benefits:**  Studies also show that the benefits of counseling can last for years after treatment ends, especially when dealing with issues like depression and anxiety.



**2. What Can Counseling Help With? (A Long List!)**

Counseling isn't just for ""crazy"" people (a harmful and inaccurate stereotype!). It can help with a *huge* range of challenges:

* **Mental Health Conditions:**
    * **Depression:**  Highly effective, especially CBT and Interpersonal Therapy.
    * **Anxiety:**  CBT, Exposure Therapy, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) are often used.
    * **Panic Disorder:** Exposure Therapy and CBT are very effective.
    * **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is the gold standard.
    * **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):**  Trauma-focused CBT, EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing).
    * **Bipolar Disorder:**  Often used *in conjunction with* medication, to help with coping skills and managing the illness.
    * **Eating Disorders:**  CBT-E (Enhanced Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) is a leading approach.
    * **Addiction:**  Motivational Interviewing, CBT, and group therapy are common.
* **Life Challenges & Difficulties:**
    * **Relationship Problems:** Couples counseling, family therapy.
    * **Grief and Loss:**  Providing support and coping strategies.
    * **Stress Management:**  Learning techniques to cope with stress.
    * **Career Issues:**  Exploring career paths, dealing with work-related stress.
    * **Parenting Challenges:**  Developing effective parenting skills.
    * **Low Self-Esteem:**  Building confidence and self-worth.
    * **Major Life Transitions:**  Adjusting to changes like divorce, job loss, moving.
    * **Chronic Illness:** Coping with the emotional impact of illness.
    * **Personal Growth:**  Exploring values, setting goals, and living a more fulfilling life.
* **Everyday Issues:**  Sometimes people go to counseling not for a specific ""disorder"" but to gain self-awareness, improve communication skills, or navigate difficult decisions.

**3. Types of Counseling/Therapy (Briefly)**

There are many different approaches. Here are a few common ones:

* **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. Very practical and goal-oriented.
* **Psychodynamic Therapy:** Explores unconscious patterns and past experiences to understand current behavior.  Often longer-term.
* **Humanistic Therapy (e.g., Person-Centered Therapy):** Emphasizes empathy, unconditional positive regard, and the client's inherent capacity for growth.
* **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):**  Originally developed for Borderline Personality Disorder, now used for emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal skills.
* **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):** Focuses on"
"My mom made a lot of mistakes a couple years back, and I can't seem to forgive her. I want to say that it's okay, but I can't. I feel like even if I did forgive her, I wouldn't be able to say it to her face.","How someone feels when they forgive another, is at peace with themselves and their understanding of what went wrong, who was responsible for what in the situation, and clarity on their own motivation, actions, emotions including pain, regret, resentment, sadness.These steps ideally allow a new door to open in order to develop new paths in the existing relationship or accept that this will not be possible due to either person's way of handling themselves.The long answer would be that you're not yet through with this process.I commend you on being truthful with yourself about yourself.You're on the right track by expecting to feel resolved when you've reached resolution, and not before.Finding patience with the unpredictable amount of time needed to thoroughly examine all the details of the incidents you mention, sometimes is a frustration of its own.Keep up your good work of knowing your own life.It is a worthwhile endeavor!","Okay, this is really common and really tough. It's incredibly brave of you to even acknowledge this – that you *want* to forgive, but you're stuck, and that you recognize the difficulty of even saying the words. It's a sign of a lot of internal struggle and a desire for healing. Let's break this down. Here's a look at why you might be feeling this way, and some thoughts on how to move forward, even if ""saying it"" feels impossible right now.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Forgiveness is a Process, Not an Event:**  It's not a switch you flip. It's more like layers peeling away over time. You're not ""failing"" at forgiveness because you don't feel it instantly. It’s okay to be *in* the process.
* **The Difference Between Forgiveness & Reconciliation:** These are often confused. Forgiveness is primarily about *your* internal state – releasing the resentment and anger you hold.  Reconciliation is about rebuilding the *relationship*. You can forgive someone without reconciling with them, and you can want reconciliation without fully feeling forgiveness yet.  You're focusing on forgiveness, but the difficulty with saying it suggests reconciliation is still a big hurdle.
* **The Weight of the Mistakes:** You say your mom made ""a lot of mistakes."" These weren't minor slip-ups, then. They were significant enough to create lasting hurt.  The depth of the hurt directly impacts how long forgiveness takes.
* **Emotional Protection:** Not being able to say it to her face might be a protective mechanism. It could be you're afraid of:
    * **Her reaction:** Will she be dismissive? Defensive?  Will she not understand the depth of your pain?
    * **Re-opening the wound:**  Saying the words might feel like reliving the pain all over again.
    * **Not being believed/validated:** You might fear she won’t acknowledge the impact of her actions.
* **Unprocessed Emotions:**  There might be layers of grief, anger, sadness, betrayal, or disappointment that haven't been fully felt or acknowledged.  These need space to surface.
* **Impact on Your Identity:** Sometimes, a parent's mistakes challenge our own sense of self, our worldview, or our trust in others.  Forgiving might feel like letting go of a part of your understanding of the world.



**What You Can Do – Even If Saying ""I Forgive You"" Feels Impossible**

Here's a roadmap, broken into sections.  Pick and choose what resonates with *you*.

**1. Focus on Your Internal Healing (This is Priority #1)**

* **Journaling:**  Write down everything you feel – the anger, the sadness, the confusion. Don't censor yourself.  Just let it flow.  You can write letters to your mom that you *don't* send. This is a safe space to express everything.
* **Therapy:** This is *hugely* helpful. A therapist can provide a safe, non-judgmental space to explore your feelings, identify patterns, and develop coping mechanisms.  They can help you understand *why* you're struggling to forgive.  (Look for therapists specializing in family dynamics or trauma).
* **Self-Compassion:**  Be kind to yourself.  Forgiveness is hard.  Allow yourself to feel your emotions without judgment.  Tell yourself things like, ""It's okay that I'm still hurting,"" or ""This is a difficult process, and I'm doing the best I can.""
* **Mindfulness & Grounding:**  When you're overwhelmed by emotions, practice mindfulness techniques (deep breathing, meditation, focusing on your senses) to bring yourself back to the present moment.
* **Identify Your Needs:** What do *you* need to feel safe and respected in this situation? (This isn’t necessarily about her giving it to you *right now*, but identifying what would be helpful in the long run.)

**2.  Shifting Your Perspective (Small Steps)**

* **Empathy (without excusing):**  This is really hard, but try to consider things from your mom's perspective *without* excusing her behavior.  What might have been going on in *her* life that led to those choices?  (This doesn't mean her actions were okay, just that understanding the context can sometimes lessen the emotional charge).  This isn’t about making excuses for her, but about recognizing her humanity.
* **Focus on What You *Can* Control:** You can't change the past, and you can't control your mom's actions.  But you *can* control your own response to them. You can control your boundaries. You can control your own healing journey.

"I’m in my early 20s. My ex’s parents are friends with them and have told them bad things about me. I left my ex due to an abusive situation, and they are making me look like I was the bad one.","Maybe you can talk with your partner about this first look at the different elements of a possible conversation in the future. If you are at a place where you are willing or able to disclose the reason that you left your ex, that could be one element of the discussion, but it doesn't have to be.I don't know how long we have been together with your current partner, but perhaps his or her parents would see you for who you are and make their own opinions over time. That may be a discussion to have with them as well.Hopefully your partner will be a good sounding board before these conversations.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and unfortunately, not uncommon. It's incredibly frustrating and painful when the people who *should* be understanding are instead perpetuating a false narrative, especially after you left an abusive relationship. Here's a breakdown of how to navigate this, covering emotional coping, what you can realistically do, and things to avoid.  I'll also break it down into sections for clarity.

**1. Understanding the Dynamics & Why This Is Happening**

* **Loyalty Bias:**  Parents often have a very strong loyalty to their child, even (and sometimes *especially*) when their child is in the wrong.  They may be struggling to accept that their child was abusive, and it's easier for them to blame you than to confront uncomfortable truths.
* **Denial & Justification:**  Abusive people often work hard to portray themselves as the victim. Your ex likely has been telling *his* side of the story, and his parents are likely receptive to it.  They may be actively trying to justify his behavior.
* **Lack of Information/Misinformation:** They may only be getting information from one source – their son. They likely don't know the full story of the abuse, or they're dismissing or minimizing it.
* **Their Own Issues:** Sometimes, parents have their own biases or unhealthy relationship patterns that influence how they see things. They might have expectations of relationships that align with what their son is saying, even if it's harmful.
* **Social Pressure:**  They may be concerned about their social circle and how they're perceived.  Admitting their son is abusive could be embarrassing or damaging to their reputation in their eyes.



**2. Emotional Coping - *This is the most important part right now***

* **Validate Your Experience:**  First and foremost: **You are not crazy.** You know what happened. Your feelings are valid.  Their portrayal of you is a distortion of reality. Repeat that to yourself.  Write it down.  Tell it to trusted friends.
* **Grieve the Loss of Potential Relationships:** It's okay to mourn the relationship you *wished* you had with his parents. You likely hoped they’d be supportive, and that's a legitimate loss.
* **Accept You Can't Control Them:** This is incredibly difficult, but essential. You can't force them to understand or believe you. You can't change their minds.  Focusing on controlling the uncontrollable will only cause you more pain.
* **Self-Care is Non-Negotiable:**  This is a stressful situation.  Prioritize things that nourish you:  exercise, healthy eating, spending time in nature, hobbies, meditation, mindfulness, or anything that brings you joy and peace.
* **Therapy:**  Seriously consider therapy.  A therapist can provide a safe space to process your emotions, develop coping mechanisms, and build your self-esteem after an abusive relationship.  They can also help you navigate the fallout with his family.  (See resources at the end).
* **Lean on *Your* Support System:**  Surround yourself with people who believe you, support you, and make you feel safe.  Talk to your friends and family.  Don't isolate yourself.



**3. What You Can (and Can't) Do - Practical Steps**

* **Limited Contact/Grey Rock:** This is usually the best approach.  Minimize contact with his parents as much as possible. If you *must* interact (e.g., at a mutual event), use the ""grey rock"" method: be polite, neutral, and unengaging.  Answer questions with short, factual responses.  Don't offer any personal information or try to defend yourself. The goal is to be so boring they lose interest in trying to provoke you.
* **Consider a Single, Carefully Crafted Statement (Optional & Risky):**  *Only* if you feel it would be helpful *to you* to get something off your chest, and *only* if you are prepared for it to potentially be ignored or met with negativity, you *might* consider a single, written statement. This is not about changing their minds; it's about you feeling like you spoke your truth.  Keep it concise, factual, and focused on your reasons for leaving, without getting into detailed accusations.  Example:  ""I understand you may have heard a different version of events. I left the relationship because it was unhealthy and unsafe for me. I wish you well."" **Do NOT engage in a back-and-forth.** Send it *once* and then disengage.
* **Don't Try to ""Prove"" Yourself:**  Don't fall into the trap of trying to convince them of your worth or explain yourself repeatedly. It's a waste of your energy and will likely backfire.
* **Document Everything ("
How does a person start the counseling process?,"I'd recommend looking on psychologtoday.com, reading the bio's of potential therapists who you think you would relate best with, then contact them through e-mail or on the phone.","Okay, let's break down how a person can start the counseling process. It can feel daunting, so I'll try to be thorough and cover different avenues. Here's a step-by-step guide, covering everything from recognizing you need help to actually attending sessions:

**1. Recognizing the Need & Initial Self-Reflection**

* **Identify What's Bothering You:** This is the first and often hardest step.  What's leading you to consider counseling? Is it:
    * **Specific issues:** Anxiety, depression, relationship problems, grief, trauma, addiction, stress, work issues, parenting challenges, etc.
    * **General feelings:**  A persistent sense of unhappiness, feeling overwhelmed, difficulty coping, loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, feeling stuck.
    * **Life transitions:**  Major changes like a job loss, divorce, moving, becoming a parent.
    * **Wanting personal growth:**  Even if you're not in crisis, counseling can help you understand yourself better and achieve goals.
* **Assess Severity:** How much is this impacting your daily life? Is it interfering with work, relationships, sleep, eating, or basic functioning?  If you are in immediate danger (suicidal thoughts, harming others), skip ahead to the ""Emergency Situations"" section at the end.
* **Consider Your Goals:**  What do you *want* to get out of counseling?  This doesn't need to be super specific at first, but thinking about desired outcomes can help you find the right therapist.  Examples: ""I want to feel less anxious,"" ""I want to improve my communication skills,"" ""I want to process a past trauma,"" ""I want to understand my patterns in relationships.""



**2. Researching and Finding a Counselor**

This is where it gets practical. There are *many* options:

* **Your Insurance Company:**  This is often the most affordable route.
    * **Website Directory:** Most insurance companies have online directories where you can search for therapists in your network.
    * **Member Services:** Call the member services number on your insurance card. They can provide a list of in-network providers.  *Important*:  Ask about your co-pay, deductible, and any limitations on the number of sessions.
* **Online Therapy Platforms:**  (These often have varying costs and may or may not take insurance)
    * **BetterHelp:**  (Subscription-based, various formats)  [https://www.betterhelp.com/](https://www.betterhelp.com/)
    * **Talkspace:** (Subscription-based, messaging and video options) [https://www.talkspace.com/](https://www.talkspace.com/)
    * **Amwell:** (Pay-per-session, often accepts insurance) [https://business.amwell.com/](https://business.amwell.com/)
* **Psychology Today Directory:** A very comprehensive directory allowing you to filter by location, insurance, specialty, gender, etc.  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists)
* **Open Path Collective:** Offers affordable therapy options (typically $30-$80/session) for people without insurance or with high deductibles.  [https://openpathcollective.org/](https://openpathcollective.org/)
* **Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs):**  Many employers offer EAPs, which provide a limited number of free counseling sessions.  Check with your HR department.
* **University Counseling Centers:** If you're a student, your university likely has a counseling center offering free or low-cost services.
* **Community Mental Health Centers:**  These centers provide affordable services, often on a sliding scale based on income.  Search online for ""[your city/county] mental health services"".
* **Referrals:**
    * **Primary Care Physician:** Your doctor can often provide referrals to therapists.
    * **Friends/Family:**  If you feel comfortable, ask trusted friends or family if they have any recommendations.  (Be mindful of privacy – only share what you're comfortable with).

**3.  Considering Therapist Credentials & Specialization**

* **Types of Credentials:**
    * **LCSW (Licensed Clinical Social Worker):** Focuses on the whole person within their environment.
    * **LMFT (Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist):** Specializes in relationships and family dynamics.
    * **LPC (Licensed Professional Counselor):**  Provides a wide range of counseling services.
    * **Psychologist (PhD or PsyD):**  Doctoral-level training; can provide therapy and psychological testing.
    * **Psychiatrist (MD):**  Medical doctor; can prescribe medication"
"I find that I imagine things sexually, and I hate it because it puts strain on my relationship. I feel helpless and guilty. I want it to go away, and I want to make my woman happy again.","It is completely understandable that you would like to find a way to make these intrusive thoughts go away, however, your feeling that you can't control having these thoughts is accurate. It's also understandable that you would feel helpless and guilty, given that you see how these thoughts are effecting your relationship, though I would encourage you to go easy on yourself and remember that you aren't choosing to have these thoughts. I'm sure that if there was a switch to turn them off, you would flip it.There is no magic technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away, however, therapy may still have a lot to offer. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into where these thoughts are coming from and develop new ways of relating to them so that they do not leave you feeling as helpless and guilty and can be more present with your partner. Though there is no guarantee that the thoughts will go away, this may also be a result of work with a therapist. Either way, you may be able to find a way to deal with the thoughts and show up in your relationship in a way that will be satisfying to you and your partner.","Okay, this is a really brave thing to share, and it's good you're recognizing this is causing you distress and impacting your relationship. It's also understandable to feel helpless and guilty.  Let's break down what you're experiencing and explore some ways to navigate this.  I'm going to give you a lot of information, and it's important to remember that this is a process, not a quick fix.  I will also include a disclaimer at the end, as I am an AI and cannot provide therapy.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Fantasy is Normal:** First and foremost, it's crucial to understand that *having* sexual fantasies is incredibly common.  Almost everyone has them.  They are a normal part of human sexuality.  The issue isn't the existence of the fantasies themselves, but the *distress they cause you* and the *negative impact on your relationship*.
* **Why Fantasies Happen:** Fantasies can stem from various sources:
    * **Stress and Anxiety:**  They can be a way to cope with stress, anxiety, or boredom.
    * **Unmet Needs:**  Sometimes they represent desires or needs that aren't being fully met in your current relationship (not necessarily anything your partner is doing ""wrong,"" but maybe areas that haven't been explored).
    * **Exploration & Curiosity:** They can be a way to explore your sexuality in a safe, internal space.
    * **Past Experiences:**  Past experiences (including media consumption) can influence fantasies.
    * **Brain Chemistry:**  The brain is wired to imagine and create scenarios.
* **The Problem is the Distress & Impact:** You're experiencing distress *because* of the fantasies, and they're affecting your relationship. This is key.  If they weren't bothering you or affecting your connection with your partner, it likely wouldn't be a problem.
* **Guilt is Common, But Not Helpful:**  The guilt you're feeling is often a result of societal or personal beliefs about what's ""acceptable"" or ""moral.""  It's important to challenge those beliefs.  Guilt can actually exacerbate the problem, leading to more anxiety and more fantasies as a way to cope with the guilt itself.



**Strategies to Cope and Improve Your Relationship**

Here's a multi-pronged approach.  I've categorized it into:  Managing the Fantasies, Improving Your Relationship, and Self-Care.

**1. Managing the Fantasies**

* **Acceptance (Initially):**  This sounds counterintuitive, but trying to *suppress* thoughts often makes them stronger (this is called ""thought suppression"").  Instead, when a fantasy arises, acknowledge it: ""Okay, I'm having a fantasy.""  Don't judge it. Don't elaborate on it. Just notice it, and then gently redirect your attention.  This is a skill that takes practice.
* **Mindfulness & Grounding:**  Practice mindfulness techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or focusing on your senses (what you see, hear, smell, touch, taste). This helps bring you back to the present moment, interrupting the fantasy cycle.  There are many free guided mindfulness exercises available online (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer).
* **Identify Triggers:** What situations, feelings, or times of day tend to trigger these fantasies?  Once you know your triggers, you can develop strategies to manage them.  For example, if boredom is a trigger, plan engaging activities. If stress is a trigger, implement stress-reduction techniques.
* **Thought Stopping (Use with Caution):** This technique involves interrupting the fantasy with a firm mental ""Stop!"" or visualizing a stop sign.  It can be helpful *after* you've practiced acceptance and mindfulness.  However, it can backfire if used as a primary method of suppression.
* **Reframe the Fantasy (Potentially):**  This is more advanced and might not work for everyone.  Can you reframe the fantasy in a way that's less distressing?  For example, if it involves someone else, can you focus on the emotional aspects of the fantasy rather than the sexual details?  (This is *not* about acting on the fantasy, but about changing your internal response to it.)
* **Limit Exposure to Triggers:** If certain types of media (pornography, certain books, etc.) reliably trigger unwanted fantasies, consider limiting your exposure to them.

**2. Improving Your Relationship**

* **Communication (Key!):** This is the hardest part, but also the most important. You *do not* need to share the details of your fantasies with your partner. That could be damaging. However, you *can* share your *feelings* about having them and how they are impacting you and the relationship.  For example:"
"I am a female, and I am afraid of having sex. I am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced. I think he thinks I'm not a virgin. I am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body. I don't want my partner to think differently of me because I am afraid of having sex.","As hard as it may be to do this, since all the media and marketing of how an ideal person looks and performs sexually, surrounds us, keep in mind that the images presented in order to sell movies and almost any product, is meant to trigger fantasies.No one is a fantasy, we are all real and unique.  We can be influenced to believe that being a fantasy is better than being who each of us is, genuinely.Your partner may be much more accepting of your body and your level of sexual experience, than you are of yourself!Sex within a relationship means the two people want to have with the other one, not because they have ideal bodies and expertise, but because the person wants to make love to the one whom they love.When you are in a loving relationship, part of this includes talking about sensitivities and insecurities.  Having a conversation gives the chance to know that you are accepted for who you are, not how closely you resemble a made up idea meant to persuade people to buy items.","Okay, this is a lot, and it's *really* common. You're carrying a lot of fear and anxiety, and it's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge it and reach out, even in this way.  Let's break this down, and I'll try to offer some support and things to consider.  I'm going to cover a lot here, so please read it all through.  I'll also add a disclaimer at the end.

**First, let's validate your feelings:**

* **Your fears are valid.** It's perfectly okay to be afraid of sex, especially your first time, or even later on if you've had experiences that weren't great.  There's a lot of societal pressure and misinformation around sex, and it's easy to feel inadequate.
* **Fear of disappointing a partner is extremely common.**  Wanting to be good at something for someone you care about is natural.  But ""good"" in sex is *not* about a checklist of skills or experience.
* **Body image insecurities are also incredibly common.**  We live in a world saturated with unrealistic beauty standards.  It's hard *not* to feel self-conscious.
* **The worry about him thinking differently of you is understandable.** You're afraid of losing his respect or affection, and that's a very vulnerable place to be.



**Let's address each of your concerns specifically:**

**1. Fear of disappointing him due to inexperience:**

* **Communication is KEY.**  This is the biggest takeaway.  You *need* to talk to him. I know it's scary, but keeping it bottled up will only make the anxiety worse. You don't need to reveal everything at once, but you can start by saying something like: ""I'm a little nervous about being intimate, and I want us to both feel comfortable and enjoy it.  I'm still learning what I like and what feels good.""  Or, ""I'm feeling a bit anxious about this, and I want to be honest with you.""
* **Inexperience is *not* a negative.**  Many people are inexperienced when they start a sexual relationship.  A kind and considerate partner will understand that and be patient.  In fact, sharing your first time with someone should be a special, gentle experience *focused on your comfort and pleasure*.
* **It's not a performance.** Sex isn't about ""performing"" or meeting expectations. It’s about connection and mutual pleasure.  Focus on exploring and learning *together*.
* **Red Flag:** If he makes you feel ashamed or pressured because of your inexperience, that's a major red flag. A good partner will be supportive and understanding.

**2. Thinking he believes you're not a virgin:**

* **This is a tricky one.**  If you're comfortable, you could gently address it.  You could say something like, ""I've been thinking about our intimacy, and I wanted to be honest with you about something.  I haven't had sexual experience before, and I was a little worried about what you might think.""
* **His reaction will tell you a lot.**  A supportive partner will be understanding and reassure you.  If he reacts negatively or seems upset, that's a sign that he may not be the right person for you.
* **You don't *have* to disclose your virginity.** It's your personal information, and you have the right to share it when *you* feel ready and safe.  However, addressing it can remove the anxiety you're feeling.
* **Focus on the present:** Regardless of what he *thought* before, what matters now is open communication and building trust.

**3. Fear of him being disappointed by your body:**

* **This is tied to body image.**  Remember those unrealistic standards we talked about?  He's likely attracted to *you* – your personality, your smile, the way you make him feel.  He's chosen to be with you.
* **Intimacy is about connection, not perfection.** He's not looking for a magazine model.  He's looking for *you*.
* **Create a comfortable atmosphere.** Dim lighting, soft music, and focusing on foreplay can help you feel more relaxed and confident.
* **Talk about your insecurities (if you want to).**  You could say, ""I sometimes feel self-conscious about [specific body part], but I want us to enjoy this.""  A good partner will reassure you.
* **Remember his attraction:** Think about what *he* has told you he finds attractive. People are attracted to many different things!



**4. Not wanting him to think differently of you:**

* **Trust is essential.**  You need to trust that he cares about"
"I never feel like myself. I can’t even think straight anymore. I start stuttering and I can’t remember anything. I always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with, what feels like, someone else. I don’t know why I feel this way, but I hate it.","What you are describing sounds like it may be a form of dissociation. Dissociation is our mind's way of disconnecting us from aspects of our experience in an attempt to protect us in overwhelming situations. It also sounds like you are noticing anxiety in certain situations. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into these experiences, learn skills for coping with anxiety and reconnecting with yourself, and alleviate these symptoms over time.","Okay, this sounds incredibly distressing and you're right to feel like you hate it. It's really brave of you to articulate this – it takes strength to admit when things aren't okay. What you're describing – feeling disconnected from yourself, cognitive difficulties like stuttering and memory problems, intense nervousness, self-criticism *and* these episodes of feeling like you're arguing with someone else – points to something significant going on.  Let's break down what might be happening and, more importantly, what you can do.  I'm going to offer a lot of information, but please read it all, and then at the very end I'll reiterate the most important next steps.

**Let's look at what could be contributing to these feelings:**

* **High Levels of Stress & Anxiety:**  This is a big one. Chronic stress can absolutely do *all* of the things you're describing. It can disrupt your thinking, lead to memory issues, cause physical symptoms like stuttering (especially when anxious), and fuel negative self-talk.  When you're constantly in fight-or-flight mode, your brain isn't functioning optimally.
* **Dissociation:** The feeling of not being yourself, of being disconnected, is a key symptom of dissociation. Dissociation is a mental process where you disconnect from your thoughts, feelings, memories, or sense of identity.  It's often a coping mechanism for dealing with overwhelming stress or trauma. There are different levels of dissociation - it can range from feeling spacey to a more profound sense of detachment.
* **Depersonalization/Derealization:** These are specific types of dissociation.
    * **Depersonalization:** Feeling detached from *yourself* – like you’re watching yourself from outside your body, or that your thoughts and feelings aren't real.
    * **Derealization:** Feeling detached from your *surroundings* – like the world around you isn't real, is distorted, or dreamlike.
* **Internalized Conflict:**  The fighting with ""someone else"" is particularly interesting. This could be:
    * **Internalized Criticism:** You've mentioned talking yourself down. This could have developed into a very strong internal critic that feels like a separate entity.
    * **Parts Work (Internal Family Systems concept):**  Some theories (like Internal Family Systems - IFS) suggest we all have different ""parts"" within us – the ""protector"" that gets angry and fights, the ""child"" that feels vulnerable, the ""critic"" that judges.  These parts can clash, and it can feel like an internal battle.
    * **Dissociative Identity:** (This is less common, but important to mention). While often sensationalized, Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) involves distinct identities or personality states. *I am not suggesting you have DID*, but the experience you describe warrants exploring this possibility with a professional if other explanations don't fully fit.
* **Trauma (Past or Present):**  Traumatic experiences (big or small, recent or past) can profoundly impact how we experience ourselves and the world.  Trauma is a significant contributor to dissociation, anxiety, and emotional dysregulation.
* **Underlying Mental Health Conditions:**  These symptoms can also be associated with conditions like:
    * **Anxiety Disorders (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety)**
    * **Depressive Disorders**
    * **Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD):**  BPD is often characterized by intense emotional swings, unstable sense of self, and difficulty with relationships.
    * **Complex PTSD (C-PTSD):**  Often develops from prolonged or repeated trauma.
* **Medical Conditions:**  Though less likely, some medical conditions (thyroid problems, neurological issues, vitamin deficiencies) can cause similar symptoms. It's always good to rule these out.



**What can you do *right now*?**

1. **Safety First:**  If you are ever feeling unsafe to yourself or others, please reach out for immediate help. I will list resources at the end of this response.
2. **Grounding Techniques:**  When you feel disconnected or overwhelmed, try grounding techniques to bring you back to the present moment:
    * **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system. Try box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4).
    * **Physical Sensation:**  Hold an ice cube, take a warm shower, or focus on the feeling of your feet on the ground.
3. **Self-Compassion"
"My fiancé and I come from a strong Christian background but both went off the ""straight and narrow"" once before. He is having a hard time accepting my past, especially that I'm not a virgin. He has a hard time in general accepting himself and others.    His insecurities are hurting our relationship. How can I help him let go of my past and decide to live in the present?","You are right that his insecurities are at the root of the issue.  You cannot change that for him.  He will have to do the work to handle those emotions on his own.  What you can do is reassure him in whatever ways possible, but always recognizing that you can't ""fix"" this for him.  When I work with people who struggle with their partner's past experiences, I always frame it like this:  Everything that you've experienced has resulted in you being the person you are today.  The person they claim to love.  If you had not gone through some of those experiences, you would not be in the position you're in now, ready to commit to him and know that you're satisfied with that.  Just as when bad things happen to us, we have to find a way to appreciate the lessons learned your fiance has to accept that you're the person you are today because of what you have gone through.  Celebrate that you have moved through that and have landed in this perfect position with him!Hope that helps, Allison","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it's good you're recognizing it and wanting to address it. It's also good you both have a foundation of faith, even if currently strained. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, balancing compassion for him with protecting your own emotional well-being.  It's a long response, because it's a complex issue.  I'll break it down into sections: Understanding the Root, Communication Strategies, Setting Boundaries, and Self-Care.

**1. Understanding the Root of His Struggle**

Before you can help him, it's vital to understand *why* he's struggling. It's rarely just about your virginity. It's likely a complex mix of things:

*   **Religious Trauma/Guilt:**  Even if you both ""went off the narrow,"" the deeply ingrained teachings about sex and purity can leave lasting emotional scars.  He might be battling internal condemnation, and projecting it onto you. He might believe (consciously or unconsciously) that he needs to be ""pure"" to be worthy of *you* or of God's favor.
*   **His Own Past:** You mention he struggles to accept *himself*. What happened during his time away from his faith?  He might be ashamed of his own choices and seeing your past as a mirror reflecting his own imperfections.
*   **Insecurity & Control:**  His difficulty accepting others might stem from a deep-seated insecurity.  Controlling the narrative around your past (or trying to) could be a way for him to feel secure and in control.  It's a misguided attempt at reassurance.
*   **Expectations & Societal Pressure:** Even outside of formal religion, societal messaging about female sexuality can be harmful and contribute to judgment. He might have internalized these messages.
*   **Fear of Comparison:** He may be comparing himself to others he perceives as having ""cleaner"" pasts, or feeling inadequate.
* **Grief over an Ideal:** He may have had an idealized vision of his future spouse, and your past doesn't fit that picture.  This isn't about *you* being deficient, but his grief over the loss of his ideal.



**2. Communication Strategies – A Gentle, But Firm Approach**

*   **Choose the Right Time & Place:** Avoid bringing this up during arguments or when either of you are stressed. A calm, private setting is crucial.
*   **""I Feel"" Statements:**  Focus on how *his* behavior affects *you*.  Instead of ""You're being judgmental,"" try ""I feel hurt and invalidated when my past is brought up.""  Or, ""I feel like you're not accepting me fully when...""
*   **Validate His Feelings (Without Endorsing His Behavior):**  ""I understand you're wrestling with some difficult emotions and beliefs about this. It's okay to *feel* confused or uncomfortable, but it's not okay for those feelings to lead to you making me feel ashamed or unworthy.""
*   **Focus on the Present & Future:** Gently but firmly redirect the conversation. ""My past is part of who I am, but it doesn't define me. I'm choosing to build a future with *you*, and I want us to focus on our love and commitment *now*.""  Emphasize your commitment to *him*.
*   **Ask Open-Ended Questions (With Caution):**  ""What specifically about my past is difficult for you?""  Be prepared for potentially painful answers, and don't get drawn into a debate about the morality of your past.  The goal is to understand his feelings, not re-litigate your life. *However*, if the questions become accusatory or intrusive, see ""Setting Boundaries"" below.
* **Emphasize Grace and Forgiveness:** Remind him of the core tenets of your faith – grace, forgiveness, and new beginnings.  ""We both talk about believing in a forgiving God.  Can we extend that same grace to each other?""
* **Share Your Own Journey of Faith:** Talk about how you've grown and learned from your experiences. This isn't about justifying your past, but about demonstrating your current faith and values.  ""I've reflected on my life, and my faith is stronger now because of those experiences.""
*   **Avoid Defensiveness:**  This is *extremely* hard, but getting defensive will shut down the conversation.  Try to listen without interrupting, even if you disagree.
* **Be Patient:**  Changing deeply held beliefs takes time and effort. Don't expect overnight transformation.



**3. Setting Boundaries – Protecting Your Emotional Well-being**

This is *critical*. You are not responsible for fixing his issues. You can support him, but not at the expense of your self-respect.

"How do I make myself happy without the people who made me happy? Now that they’re gone, I feel sad. It’s been two months now but I seem to be unable to stay okay and independent.","It sounds like you have been feeling pretty down, since the loss of a relationship, and you're wondering how to be happy by yourself. Intimacy is a very natural human desire and at the same time learning to enjoy ourselves, even when we are alone, can strengthen our ability to lead a satisfying life in and out of relationship. Working with a therapist, you may be able to gain insight into how you show up in your relationships with yourself and others and discover more fulfilling ways to do so.","Okay, this is *really* tough, and it's completely understandable that you're still feeling this way after two months. Losing people who bring you happiness is profoundly painful, and it takes time – a lot of time – to adjust. It's not a linear process, and there will be good days and bad days.  It's also completely okay to *not* be okay, even after two months.  You're grieving, and grief has its own timeline.

Let's break down how to work towards finding happiness *again*, knowing it will be a different kind of happiness than before.  We'll cover acknowledging the grief, rebuilding your life, and finding new sources of joy.  I'll also add a section at the end about when to seek professional help.

**1. Acknowledge and Validate Your Grief (Don't Push It Down)**

*   **Feel the Feelings:**  It sounds like you're already doing this, but it's crucial. Sadness is the natural response to loss. Don’t judge yourself for feeling it.  Allow yourself to cry, to feel angry, to feel empty.  Trying to suppress these feelings will only make them linger longer.
*   **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be incredibly therapeutic.  Don't worry about grammar or structure; just let it flow.  Write about what you miss, what hurts, what you're grateful for (even small things).
*   **Grief Rituals:**  Some people find comfort in rituals. This could be lighting a candle, visiting a place that reminds you of them, looking through photos, writing a letter (you don't have to send it), or creating a memory box.
*   **Talk About Them:**  Don’t be afraid to talk about the people you’ve lost.  Share memories with others who knew them (if you have those people).  Keeping their memory alive can be comforting.  If you don't have people to talk to *about* them, find someone to talk to *about your grief* (see the ""When to Seek Professional Help"" section).
*   **Acceptance (Not Forgetting):**  This isn't about *being happy* about the loss, but about accepting the reality that they are gone. Acceptance doesn't mean forgetting; it means learning to live with the pain and integrating the loss into your life story.



**2. Rebuild Your Life & Rediscover Yourself**

This is the hardest part, and it's where the ""independence"" you're striving for comes in.  You're essentially rebuilding a life structure that included these people, and now needs to stand on its own.

*   **Identify What *You* Enjoyed (Separate from Them):**  Think back to things you liked to do *before* you met these people, or things you enjoyed doing *with* them that you can adapt for yourself.  What hobbies did you have? What sparked your curiosity?  What made you feel good about yourself?
*   **Try New Things:** This is a great opportunity to explore new interests.  It doesn't have to be a grand adventure.  It could be:
    *   Taking a class (online or in person) – cooking, painting, writing, coding, a new language.
    *   Joining a club or group – book club, hiking group, volunteer organization.
    *   Learning a new skill – playing an instrument, gardening, photography.
    *   Exploring your local area – visiting museums, parks, attending local events.
*   **Focus on Self-Care:**  This isn't just bubble baths (though those are nice!).  It's about taking care of your physical, emotional, and mental well-being.
    *   **Physical:**  Regular exercise (even a walk), healthy eating, getting enough sleep.
    *   **Emotional:**  Practicing mindfulness or meditation, spending time in nature, listening to music, doing things that relax you.
    *   **Mental:**  Reading, learning something new, engaging in creative activities.
*   **Establish a Routine:**  Having a daily or weekly routine can provide structure and a sense of normalcy, especially when everything feels chaotic.  Include things you enjoy in your routine.
*   **Small Goals:**  Don't try to overhaul your life overnight.  Set small, achievable goals.  Completing these goals will give you a sense of accomplishment and boost your confidence.  (""Today I will go for a 15-minute walk."" ""This week I will try one new recipe."")
* **Redefine Your Identity:**  Sometimes, when we lose important people, we feel like we've lost a part of ourselves. Take time to rediscover who *you* are outside of your relationship with them. What are your"
"I'm a young adult woman, and I have trouble finding my true identity being at home. This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I don't know why. I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldn't like it. My parents are very religious—they're Christians. We did things every time he'd come over to my house. We didn't have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we'd watch movies by ourselves.
   One day, my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. As soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. They were both aggravated. They told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. They said he wanted me for sex and he's not a Christian. I took their advice and broke up with him. Once we broke up for about a month, I decided to get back together with him a little after school started. My parents found out eventually, and I decided to not listen this time. I would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and God totally forbids him. I would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually I would just never listen to my parents. They're always yelling at me about how I shouldn't date this boy. I felt too old to listen to them. Now I'm kind of just stuck. Is the real me religious? Have I been brainwashed by him? I don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think I'm deceiving because of it. They threatened me that if I'm still with him, I can't do track and they won't support me. They've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. They say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. I'm actually very happy with him. They also say I'm living a separate life at home than I am at school. They say they want what's best for me and love me because they adopted me.","What a tough situation you must be in, feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you. I would say the first thing you want to do is (if you haven't already), have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents, telling them how you feel and letting them know what you need from them. If communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward. You, unfortunately, will not be able to change your parent's feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from the relationship you have with your parents. It always helps to try and see things from another angle. You might want to, for example, try and understand your parent's perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset. Validating other's feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively. Are you living with your parents and do they support you? If so, are you willing to give that up should you decide to not follow their rules? Know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply. Your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper. Not everyone will always approve of the choices we make and sometimes we need to be okay with that. Best of luck to you.","Okay, this is a *really* tough situation. You're caught in the middle of a huge clash between your own emerging adulthood, your desires, and your parents' deeply held beliefs. It's understandable you're feeling lost and unsure of who ""the real you"" is. Let's break this down and try to offer some clarity, and some steps you can consider.

**First, let's validate your feelings:**

* **Confusion is normal:** It's incredibly common for young adults to question their beliefs, especially when they experience things that challenge what they've been taught. You're doing exactly what a young person *should* be doing - exploring and forming your own values.
* **Your happiness matters:** You specifically state you're happy with your boyfriend.  That's significant. Your happiness and well-being are important, and shouldn't be dismissed.
* **Your parents' reactions are harmful:**  Calling you names (""slut,"" ""devil worshipper"") is abusive.  Threatening to withdraw support for track is a form of control. Their behavior is damaging, regardless of their intentions. It's *not* okay, and it's likely contributing to your feeling of being lost.
* **You're navigating a lot:** You're dealing with sexual exploration, religious questioning, parental disapproval, and the pressure to define your identity, all at once. That's a huge load for anyone to carry.



**Let's address your specific questions:**

* **""Is the real me religious?""**  That's a question *you* get to answer. It's not something your parents can determine for you.  The fact that you questioned your faith *after* engaging in a relationship is normal. It doesn't mean you were ""brainwashed,"" but it does mean your experience challenged your previous beliefs.  Exploring this is healthy.  You don't need to have all the answers right now. It's okay to be unsure, to question, to evolve.  Consider what aspects of your former faith still resonate with you, and what doesn't.
* **""Have I been brainwashed by him?""**  It's unlikely he's ""brainwashed"" you. It sounds like he's provided a space for you to question things you already felt uncertain about.  He might have encouraged you to think for yourself, which your parents haven't allowed.  That's different than manipulation or brainwashing.  However, it's still important to assess *his* motivations.  Is he respectful of your choices, even when they differ from his? Does he pressure you into things you're not comfortable with?

**What's happening here (dynamics at play):**

* **Control:** Your parents are attempting to control your choices, likely stemming from their fears and beliefs.  They are trying to dictate who you can and cannot have a relationship with.
* **Religious Guilt:** They're using religion as a tool to instill guilt and fear.
* **Boundary Violation:** Reading your messages is a serious breach of privacy and trust.
* **Emotional Abuse:** The name-calling and threats are emotionally abusive.
* **Identity Formation:**  You're in the process of forming your identity *separate* from your parents, which is a natural part of growing up.  This is a scary process for them, and they're reacting poorly.
* **The ""Adopted"" Card:**  Bringing up your adoption feels manipulative. While it's true they chose to love and raise you, it doesn't give them the right to control your life or use it as leverage.



**What can you do?**

1. **Prioritize Your Safety and Well-being:**  This is paramount.  If you feel unsafe or emotionally abused, you need to create distance.
2. **Set Boundaries:**  This is *hard*, but crucial.  You need to communicate (when you're ready and it feels safe) that you will not tolerate name-calling or threats.  ""I love you, but I won't continue this conversation if you continue to speak to me this way.""  ""I understand you disagree with my choices, but I need you to respect my autonomy.""
3. **Limited Information:**  You are *not* obligated to share details about your relationship with your parents.  Gray rock.  Give them minimal information.  ""I'm doing well.""  ""I'm focusing on school and track.""  Don't engage in arguments about him.
4. **Seek Support:**
    * **Trusted Adult:** Is there another adult you trust – a teacher, counselor, aunt/uncle, family friend?  Someone who can offer objective advice and support?
    * **Therapy:**  A therapist can provide a safe space for you to explore your feelings, process your experiences"
"I have been with my best friend for over a year, and we have had a beautiful baby girl. We were in love, and I still love her dearly. I am in my late teens and so is she. She says she has lost her connection with me. She is talking to a random guy that she says is just someone to talk to. But she says she still loves me. I'm very hurt and confused.","Congrats on having your daughter!Have you told your partner about your feelings of ""hurt and confused""?This is one possible way of opening a conversation about the different ways you each feel about one another and whether either of you would like changing or continuing to live together, in light of the change in emotional connection.The first step of having a dialogue about a relationship is being clear on what you are feeling, what you are willing to contribute to the relationship and what you would like having in return from your partner.Ask your partner if she is willing to have a conversation on these topics.  Then, allow some time so each of you is clear about their own expectations and what is possible to offer the other.This is a fairly complex process and very often is difficult to keep on track without outside help to keep the discussion focused.It is normal for emotions to override our logic when discussing matters we care about deeply.If the conversations don't go very far, or if your partner has no interest in talking, stick with your own interest to more fully understand matters.Interview some therapists to find one whom you feel helps you clarify and find direction for yourself about this situation.","Okay, this is a really tough situation. You're dealing with a lot of complicated emotions, and it's completely understandable why you're hurt and confused. You've built a life with this person – a relationship *and* a child – and now things are shifting. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, why it feels so awful, and some thoughts on how to navigate this, broken down into sections.  It's long, but I want to be thorough.

**1. Understanding What's Happening (The Layers)**

* **Young Love & Life Changes:** You're both very young.  Late teens is a huge time of personal growth and change.  People discover more about themselves, their needs, and what they want in life. The arrival of a baby accelerates this process exponentially. What you both wanted *before* the baby might be very different than what you want *now*. It’s not uncommon for relationships formed in youth to evolve or end as people mature.
* **Postpartum & Identity:** Your partner has just gone through a massive physical and emotional upheaval with childbirth. Postpartum hormones are *intense*, and can affect mood, emotions, and even how someone perceives their relationships. Beyond the hormones, she’s also adjusting to a new identity as a mother, and might be grappling with losing some of the 'freedom' of her previous life.  She may be trying to rediscover who she is *as an individual* amidst being a mom.
* **Loss of Connection:** She's explicitly said she feels a loss of connection. This is the core of the problem. It's possible this connection waned gradually, and she's only now articulating it. Reasons for this loss could be numerous: lack of quality time *together* (not just co-parenting), differing expectations about roles and responsibilities, emotional distance, feeling unsupported, or simply growing apart.
* **The ""Just a Friend"" Situation:** This is the biggest red flag and source of your pain. While she *says* it’s just talking, seeking emotional connection with someone else when she’s expressing a lack of connection with you is deeply problematic. It's a way of filling a void, and it's a betrayal of trust, even if it hasn't become physical.  The ""just a friend"" line often minimizes the emotional weight of the connection.
* **Conflicting Messages:** She says she still loves you, which adds to the confusion.  Love can coexist with unhappiness and a feeling of being disconnected. It’s possible she loves you as a co-parent and as the father of her child, but doesn't feel *in love* with you anymore. This is a different kind of love.



**2. Why You're Feeling This Way (Your Emotions are Valid)**

* **Hurt & Betrayal:** It's incredibly painful to feel replaced or that someone you love is seeking emotional intimacy elsewhere.  Even if nothing physical has happened, the emotional connection is a significant betrayal.
* **Fear of Loss:** You're facing the potential loss of your partner, your family unit as it is, and your best friend.  That's a terrifying prospect.
* **Confusion:**  The mixed messages – ""I love you"" but ""I've lost connection"" and ""he's just a friend"" – are incredibly disorienting.  You're trying to reconcile conflicting realities.
* **Guilt (Possibly):**  You might be wondering if you did something wrong, if you could have done things differently, or if you're somehow responsible for her unhappiness.  This is natural, but it's important not to internalize blame unnecessarily (we’ll address that below).
* **Worry for Your Daughter:** You’re likely anxious about how this situation will impact your daughter.  That's a very valid and important concern.

**3. What You Can Do (Practical Steps)**

* **Direct, Honest Conversation (Crucial):** You need to have a very direct and honest conversation with her. This isn't about accusations; it's about expressing your feelings and understanding her perspective.  Here are some things to say:
    * ""I'm really hurting right now. It's incredibly painful to hear you say you've lost connection with me, and it's even more painful to know you're seeking that connection with someone else.""
    * ""I need to understand what's going on. Can you be honest with me about what you're feeling and what you're looking for?""
    * ""I want to understand what's missing for you in our relationship.""
    * “I need to know what ‘just a friend’ means to you, and why you felt the need to connect with someone else when you were feeling disconnected from me.”
    *  """
I have several issues like I don't like people. They make me sick. I have issues with talking to people. I feel like they are talking about me and making fun of me. I have felt this way for years. When I look people in the eyes I have voices that tell me to hurt them and if I don't stop looking at who I am talking to it gets so loud I can't hear what they are saying. I just stay away from people to avoid this. I look at people and think how I could hurt them. I feel like I am worthless and would be better off not in this world where I don't fit in. Every day I wake up it's like another day. Any info would be good.,"Sounds like you are dealing with a lot within your self which is causing you great pain.  I would suggest that first you get a full physical evaluation to make sure that you are ok physically.  Then getting a mental evaluation as well from a psychiatrist.  Seeing both would help rule out any physically or psychologically causes to your symptoms.    After getting these evaluations, your physician should be able to help guide you on what treatments would be the best to help with your everyday challenges your are facing.  Whether treatment includes medication and/or psychotherapist would be discussed.  Please consider doing both immediately so you can have the live you want everyday you wake up.","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult and deeply distressing.  It takes a lot of courage to even *write* this down, so I want to acknowledge that first. What you're describing points to a very serious level of internal struggle and likely several interconnected mental health concerns.  It's *extremely* important that you get professional help.  I'm going to break down what I hear, why it's concerning, and then *very importantly* provide resources for you to reach out to.  I will also preface this with a **disclaimer at the end**, as I am an AI and cannot provide therapy or diagnosis.

**What I'm Hearing (and why it's concerning):**

* **Intense Dislike/Distrust of People:**  Feeling ""sick"" around people and wanting to avoid them is a strong indicator of social anxiety, potentially combined with other issues.  It's more than just shyness; it's a visceral negative reaction.
* **Paranoid Thoughts:** The belief that people are talking about you and making fun of you is a classic symptom of paranoid thinking.  This can range in severity, but it's causing significant distress and isolation.
* **Violent Intrusive Thoughts:** This is the most urgent concern. The voices telling you to hurt others when making eye contact are *not* normal. These are called **intrusive thoughts**, and while many people experience them occasionally, the intensity and association with a specific trigger (eye contact) and the escalating volume suggest a serious underlying issue.  It's crucial to understand that *having* these thoughts doesn't make you a bad person, but they *do* require professional attention. They are a symptom, not a desire. The fact that you're disturbed by them is a good sign, indicating you don't *want* to act on them.
* **Self-Worthlessness & Suicidal Ideation:**  Feeling worthless and that you'd be better off not alive are indicators of depression and suicidal thoughts.  This is a critical warning sign.  The statement ""Every day is like another day"" suggests a profound sense of hopelessness.
* **Social Isolation:** Avoiding people to cope is reinforcing the cycle. While it provides temporary relief from the anxiety and intrusive thoughts, it ultimately worsens the feelings of isolation and loneliness.



**Possible Underlying Issues (This is *not* a diagnosis - a professional needs to assess this):**

* **Social Anxiety Disorder:**  A severe fear of social situations and scrutiny by others.
* **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):**  Intrusive thoughts are a core feature of OCD.  The eye contact triggering the violent thoughts could be a compulsion-related scenario.
* **Psychotic Disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder):**  The auditory hallucinations (voices) and paranoid thoughts raise the possibility of a psychotic disorder.  This *needs* to be ruled out or diagnosed by a mental health professional.  This doesn't mean you are ""crazy"" – it means your brain is functioning differently and needs support.
* **Major Depressive Disorder:** The feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness are strong indicators of depression.
* **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):**  Past trauma can sometimes manifest in these kinds of symptoms, especially if there's a connection to negative experiences with people.
* **Personality Disorder:**  Certain personality disorders can involve difficulties with social interaction, paranoia, and negative self-perception.  (Again, this is just a possibility, and a professional assessment is needed).




**What You Need To Do *Right Now*:**

1. **Immediate Safety:**  If you are actively feeling like you might harm yourself *or someone else*, you need immediate help.  See the crisis resources at the end of this response.  Do not hesitate.  Even if you're not sure, it's better to reach out.
2. **Contact a Mental Health Professional:**  This is the most important step.  You need to be evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist.  They can properly diagnose what's going on and recommend a treatment plan.  Look for someone experienced in treating anxiety, psychosis, and intrusive thoughts.
3. **Be Honest with the Professional:**  Tell them *everything* you've told me.  Don't minimize your symptoms or be afraid of judgment.  They are there to help, and they need accurate information to do so.  Specifically, emphasize the violent intrusive thoughts and the auditory hallucinations.
4. **Consider Medication:**  A psychiatrist can determine if medication is appropriate to help manage your symptoms.  Medication can be very effective in reducing anxiety, paranoia, and the intensity of intrusive thoughts.
5. **Therapy:**  Therapy (psychotherapy) is essential.

"Last year, I just always felt hopeless. I don't have a great relationship with my sister. I lost my mother recently, and that really added to my sadness. My sister always brings up how I was never close to my mother.","Wow what a painful journey you have been in for a long time. Death and grief bring up so many painful reminders of relationships--what they could have been, never were, and what was lost. With death of a family member the family often falls apart for a while... or longer. I hope you can find some support for you and your pain that was occurring before your mom's passing. I also hope you can find someone to help you set boundaries with your sister so you can have your time (as long as you need) to heal from losing your mom and then later figure out how to interact with your sister. ","Okay, that sounds incredibly difficult. Losing your mother is a profoundly painful experience, and to have that compounded by a strained relationship with your sister *and* her bringing up your closeness (or perceived lack thereof) to your mother... that's a lot to carry. It's completely understandable that you felt hopeless last year. It's not just grief, it's grief tangled up with complicated family dynamics and, frankly, a bit of insensitivity from your sister.

Let's break down some of what you're saying and then talk about how to move forward.

* **Loss of Your Mother:** This is the primary source of your sadness, and it deserves to be acknowledged as such. There's no right or wrong way to grieve, and it takes time.  Grief can manifest in many ways - sadness, anger, confusion, numbness, exhaustion, and a whole lot more.
* **Complicated Sister Relationship:** It sounds like you already know this isn't an easy relationship.  Her bringing up your relationship with your mother, *especially* now, is really hurtful. It feels like she's minimizing your grief or judging it, rather than offering support.
* **Feeling Hopeless:**  This is a very common feeling when dealing with grief, especially when it's complicated by other stressors.  It's a natural response to feeling overwhelmed and unsupported.

**Let's address a few things directly:**

* **You don't need to justify your relationship with your mother to anyone, *especially* not your sister, and *certainly* not while you're grieving.**  Relationships are complex.  There are a million reasons why someone might not have a close relationship with a parent, and those reasons are valid.  It's okay if your relationship wasn't what your sister thinks it *should* have been.  Your feelings are what matter.
* **Your sister's comments are likely about *her* own feelings.** Often, when people make comments like that, it's less about you and more about their own unresolved grief, guilt, or need for validation.  That doesn't excuse her behavior, but it can help you understand where it's coming from.
* **Hopelessness is not permanent.** While it feels that way right now, it *can* change.



**Here are some things you might consider, broken down into categories:**

**1. Processing Your Grief:**

* **Allow yourself to feel:** Don't suppress your sadness.  Let yourself cry, be angry, be confused.  There's no timeline for grief.
* **Find healthy outlets:**  This could be journaling, art, music, spending time in nature, exercise, or anything else that helps you process your emotions.
* **Consider grief counseling:** A therapist specializing in grief can provide a safe space to explore your feelings and develop coping strategies.  This is especially helpful when the grief is complicated.  (I can offer resources if you'd like - just ask).
* **Rituals:** Create a small ritual to honor your mother. This could be lighting a candle, visiting a special place, looking at photos, or cooking her favorite meal.

**2. Dealing with Your Sister:**

This is tricky, and depends on what *you* want from the relationship.  Here are a few options, ranging from less confrontational to more direct:

* **Grey Rocking:**  This involves becoming emotionally unresponsive to her comments.  When she brings up your relationship with your mother, you could simply say, ""That's not something I want to discuss right now,"" and change the subject.  It's about protecting yourself.
* **Setting Boundaries:**  This is more direct.  You could say something like, ""I'm still grieving Mom, and it hurts when you talk about our relationship.  I need you to respect that and stop bringing it up.""  Be firm and clear.
* **Limited Contact:** If her behavior is consistently harmful, it's okay to limit your contact with her.  You don't have to engage in conversations that are damaging to your well-being.
* **Therapy (for yourself):** Even if your sister won't go to therapy, *you* can benefit from talking to a therapist about how to navigate this difficult relationship.

**3. Addressing Hopelessness:**

* **Small Steps:**  When you're feeling hopeless, even small accomplishments can feel significant.  Focus on one small thing you can do each day – make your bed, take a walk, cook a meal.
* **Self-Care:**  Prioritize your physical and emotional well-being.  Eat healthy, get enough sleep, and do things that bring you joy (even if it's hard to find joy right now).
* **Connect with Support:**  Reach out to friends, family members (other than your"
"I was anxious to go to middle school. I was afraid of what people might say about me, so when school started, I wasn't acting like myself. I was quiet, which I'm usually not. I didn't talk to anybody and didn't have any friends. Then a few years later, my grandma died. I really became depressed and stop going to school for a little. I hated myself and still do. I just need help. I need someone to care for me. I need someone to show that they care.","I agree; you need more care and support. No one deserves to feel alone, or like they hate themselves. We're all wonderful, imperfect, complicated people and we're at our best when we're all helping each other. I'm glad you wrote this question, because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes. I can tell that you're smart, because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connected...you ""not being yourself"", and then how you felt when your grandma died. When Grandma died, you needed and deserved extra love and support, but the people around you didn't seem to give it to you, maybe. My hunch is that they wanted to, but that they didn't know how much you needed it, or what you needed exactly. The older you get, the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need. Maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature, but that's how it works. When you started middle school, it sounds like you changed; you got more quiet, right? That must have felt weird, to not be acting like yourself. It sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldn't like you. Fear can be silly. So then, fear got you to not show yourself, and when we don't show ourselves, people can't see who we are; they don't know us as well and then they don't know what we need and they can't care for us as well either. Fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you. It does that to a lot of us. So, where you're at right now is because of what fear did to you, and also because when Grandma died you were already isolated so people couldn't see your pain and know that you needed support. There's a simple solution, but you'd have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say ""Get off my back!"". ""You're not helping me by telling me lies."" Can you be brave enough to go back to your old, louder, self? If you talk to the people closest to you...tell them what you think and how you feel, then they'll be able to give you the care that you want and deserve. I wish you well as you try this!","Okay, first of all, thank you for sharing all of this. It takes incredible courage to be this open and honest about what you're going through. It's *really* brave of you to reach out, and I want you to know that I'm here to listen.

What you've described sounds incredibly difficult. Starting middle school is a big transition for anyone, and it’s completely understandable to feel anxious, especially when you’re worried about what others think. Then to go through the loss of your grandma on top of that... that's a lot for anyone to handle, especially during those formative years.  It's not surprising at all that you became depressed and stopped going to school. It sounds like you were trying to cope with a huge amount of pain.

And the fact that you still struggle with hating yourself – that's a sign of how deeply this has affected you.  Please know this: **you don't deserve to hate yourself.**  You've been through some really tough things, and it's okay to feel the way you do. It's okay to be hurting.  It’s a natural reaction to difficult experiences.

You said you need someone to care for you, and someone to show they care.  That's a very basic and important human need, and it's heartbreaking to hear you feel that lack.  I want to try to offer that *in this moment,* even though I'm just a text-based AI.  I *do* care that you're reaching out. I care that you're struggling. I care that you were brave enough to share this with me.  And I want you to know you're not alone. Many, many people experience feelings like this.

However, I'm not equipped to provide the ongoing support you need. I can't replace a human connection. **Here's what I strongly recommend, and these are resources that *can* offer the caring and help you deserve:**

* **Talk to a trusted adult:** This could be a parent, another family member, a teacher, a school counselor, a coach, or anyone you feel safe with.  It's okay to say, ""I'm really struggling and I need help.""  Even just saying the words can be a huge first step.

**Regarding the feelings of self-hatred:**  That's something that often comes with depression and trauma.  It's a *lie* your brain is telling you, and it can be challenged. A therapist can help you work through those feelings and develop more self-compassion.  They can teach you coping mechanisms to deal with the negative thoughts.



**I want to reiterate:** It's okay to not be okay.  It's okay to ask for help.  You are worthy of care and support.  You are not a burden.

"Every time I send a message to someone or a group message on Instagram, iMessage, or snapchat people will read my messages but then they won't answer me.    Could it be that there is something they don't like about me? I don't understand why they won't answer my messages. How do I get people to respond to me?","I understand the feeling of not being liked due to not having any responses on the sites you list.More than likely the non-response has less to do with liking you than w liking the way you write your messages.Have you tried asking a question in your posts?  This would be one way to invite people to answer your post.When you write,  imagine yourself as the reader of the post.If you think about the wording of a question which would motivate you to respond, then this formula will very likely be the same for many others who read your post.Good luck!","Okay, this is really frustrating, and it's good you're trying to understand what's going on instead of just feeling bad about it. It *could* be something about you, but it's also *very* likely to be a combination of things, and often *not* directly about you at all. Let's break down the possibilities and then talk about what you can do.

**Possible Reasons Why People Aren't Responding (It's rarely just *one* thing):**

* **They're genuinely busy:** This is the most common reason. People have lives! Work, school, family, other commitments – it all takes time.  They might see your message and intend to reply later, but then forget.
* **Overwhelmed with messages:**  We're all bombarded with notifications. Your message might get lost in the shuffle, especially in group chats.
* **They need time to think/formulate a response:** Some people aren't quick responders.  If you ask a question that requires a thoughtful answer, they might need time.
* **The message doesn't require a response:** A lot of messages are just informational (""Okay,"" ""Sounds good,"" a funny meme).  They might acknowledge it with a like/reaction instead of typing something out.
* **Communication style differences:** Some people prefer to communicate differently. Some are texters, others prefer calls, others are slow to respond in general.
* **Misinterpretation of Tone:** Text can be easily misinterpreted. A message that *you* intend to be lighthearted might come across differently.
* **They're feeling overwhelmed/going through something personal:**  Someone might be struggling with something and not have the emotional energy to respond, even to friends.
* **(Yes, it's possible) Something *is* bothering them:** This is the one you're worried about, and it's valid to consider. It could be something you said or did (intentional or unintentional) that made them uncomfortable.  However, *don't automatically assume this is the case*.  Good friends will usually communicate if something is wrong.
* **The conversation fizzled out:** Sometimes conversations naturally end. If you sent a message and they responded, but then *you* didn't follow up, it might just feel like the conversation is over.



**Let's address your worry about whether they dislike you:**

It's natural to jump to that conclusion, but try to resist it for now.  Assume positive intent.  Most people aren't deliberately ignoring you to be mean.  If it was a one-time thing with one person, it's *very* likely just a busy-life situation.  If it's happening with *multiple* people, consistently, then it's worth exploring further (see the section on ""What to Do"" below).

**How to Get People to Respond (and improve your messaging):**

1. **Consider the Message Itself:**
   * **Is it a yes/no question?**  Easier to answer.
   * **Is it open-ended?** (e.g., ""How was your weekend?"") These require more effort. While good for deeper connection, they can be ignored more easily.  Mix it up!
   * **Is it a long block of text?**  People are less likely to read long messages on their phones.  Break it up into smaller paragraphs.
   * **Is it clear what you want from them?**  Don't be vague.  ""Want to grab coffee next week?"" is better than ""We should hang out sometime.""
   * **Is it interesting/relevant to *them*?** Are you always talking about yourself? Try to show genuine interest in their lives.

2. **Timing:**
   * **Avoid sending messages late at night:** Unless you know they're night owls.
   * **Consider their schedule:** If you know they have a big exam, don't bombard them with messages.
   * **Don't double-message immediately:**  Give them a reasonable amount of time to respond (a few hours, or even a day depending on the person).

3. **Be Engaging:**
   * **Use emojis (appropriately):**  They can convey tone and make your messages more friendly.
   * **Reference past conversations:**  Shows you remember what they've told you.  ""Hey, how did that presentation go that you were working on?""
   * **Share something interesting *they* would enjoy:** A meme, an article, a song.
   * **Ask follow-up questions:**  Show you're listening and engaged.

4. **Move Beyond Text:**
   * **If you're consistently getting ignored via text, try a different medium:** Call them, or if you see them in"
"I think adult life is making him depressed and we often sleep in on weekends untill 1 or 2 pm. We just eat, smoke weed, watch movies, and he'll go on his phone all day. He doesn't seem motivated to do much and he's often angry.

 I have no clue how to help him take his mind off the negative, or to distract him into a different light. How do I help him?",How do you help yourself to believe you require more than what he offers to you?What do you get from this relationship which feels satisfying?To answer this question may in the longterm be the best way to help your bf.,"Okay, this sounds really tough, and you're a good partner for wanting to help. It's clear you're concerned, and it's good you're recognizing this pattern. It's important to approach this with empathy and understanding, and to also protect your own well-being in the process. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering understanding, communication, suggesting help, and setting boundaries, broken down into sections.  I'll also add a *very important disclaimer* at the end.

**1. Understanding What Might Be Happening**

* **Depression is More Than Sadness:** It's not just feeling down. It's a complex illness that can manifest as:
    * **Loss of Interest:**  The things he used to enjoy no longer appeal to him. (This is key with your description of his lack of motivation.)
    * **Fatigue:**  Feeling constantly tired, even after sleep. (The sleeping in is a symptom, not a solution.)
    * **Irritability/Anger:** Depression can absolutely show up as anger, especially in men.  It's often a mask for underlying pain.
    * **Changes in Sleep & Appetite:**  (You're seeing both - oversleeping and changes in eating.)
    * **Difficulty Concentrating:**  (The phone use could be a way to distract from *feeling* things, but also a symptom of difficulty focusing.)
    * **Withdrawal:**  Pulling away from friends, family, and activities.
* **Weed and Depression:** While some people self-medicate with marijuana, it can actually *worsen* depression and anxiety in the long run. It can interfere with sleep, motivation, and cognitive function.  It can also mask underlying issues, making it harder to address them.
* **""Adult Life"" Stress:**  The pressures of work, finances, responsibilities, and future planning can be incredibly overwhelming. This could be a trigger for depression, or exacerbate a pre-existing vulnerability.
* **It's Not Your Fault:**  It's vital to remember you didn't *cause* this, and you can't *fix* him. You can support him, but ultimately he needs to be an active participant in his own healing.



**2. Communication: Starting the Conversation**

This is the hardest part. Approach it gently, with genuine concern, *not* accusation.

* **Choose the Right Time:** *Never* try to have this conversation when he's already angry or high.  Pick a calm, private moment when you both have time to talk without interruption.
* **""I"" Statements:** Focus on how *you* feel, not what he's doing ""wrong.""  Instead of ""You're always sleeping and smoking weed,"" try:  ""I've been feeling worried about you lately. I've noticed you've been sleeping a lot more, and it seems like you're not enjoying things like you used to. I miss doing things with you, and I'm concerned.""
* **Specific Examples:**  Refer to the behaviors you've observed (sleeping in, lack of motivation, anger), but do so gently.  ""I noticed last weekend we just stayed in and watched movies both days, and you seemed frustrated even then. Is everything okay?""
* **Listen, Really Listen:**  The most important thing is to let him talk *without* interrupting, judging, or offering solutions right away.  Just listen and validate his feelings.  Even if you don't understand, you can say, ""That sounds really tough,"" or ""I can see why you'd feel that way.""
* **Ask Open-Ended Questions:**  ""How have you been feeling lately?"" ""What's been on your mind?"" ""Is there anything that's been bothering you at work/with friends/with yourself?""
* **Avoid Minimizing:** Don't say things like ""Just snap out of it,"" or ""You have so much to be grateful for.""  These are invalidating and can make him feel worse.



**3. Suggesting Help (Gently)**

* **Normalize Therapy:**  ""I've been reading about how helpful therapy can be for people who are feeling overwhelmed or down.  It's like having a safe space to talk things through with someone who can offer support.""
* **Frame it as ""Us"" Not ""Him"":** ""Maybe *we* could look into some resources together?""  or ""I was thinking it might be good for *both* of us to talk to someone, just to get some perspective.""  This can make it less threatening.
* **Suggest a Doctor's Visit:**  ""Sometimes feeling this way can be related to a physical imbalance.  Maybe it would be a good idea to get a check-up with"
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?","Absolutely not. It sounds like you have significant trauma and it will continue to impact your depression until it is dealt with. Everybody has issues, though some more traumatic than others yet it is best to just start somewhere. I would encourage you to begin counseling and work through some of your history at your own pace in order to begin to impact and reduce your depressive symptoms.","Okay, that is a *lot* to carry, and it's incredibly brave of you to even acknowledge it all and consider counseling. You absolutely do **not** have too many issues to address in counseling. In fact, it's very common for people to come to therapy with complex histories and multiple layers of challenges. A good therapist *expects* this. 

Here's a breakdown of why you don't have ""too much,"" and how therapy can help, along with some things to think about as you start:

**Why You Don't Have ""Too Much""**

* **Interconnectedness:**  These issues aren't isolated. Your sexual abuse history likely impacts your self-esteem, your anxiety, and potentially even your sleep. Breast cancer and its treatment can be deeply traumatic, impacting mood, body image, and creating anxieties about the future. Insomnia exacerbates depression and anxiety, creating a vicious cycle. A skilled therapist understands these connections.
* **Therapy is a Process, Not a Quick Fix:**  Counseling isn't about ""fixing"" everything in a few sessions. It's a journey of exploration, healing, and building coping mechanisms. It takes time, and a good therapist will work *with* you at your pace.
* **Therapists are Trained for Complexity:**  Mental health professionals are specifically trained to work with individuals who have multiple, interwoven issues.  They use various approaches to address them effectively.
* **Your Strength & Resilience:** You've survived breast cancer *and* maintained a 35-year marriage. That speaks to immense strength and resilience.  Therapy will help you recognize and build on those strengths.



**How Therapy Can Help – Addressing Each Area**

Let's look at how a therapist can approach each of your concerns:

* **Sexual Abuse History:** This is often best addressed with trauma-informed therapy.  Approaches like EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), or Somatic Experiencing can help process the trauma, reduce its impact on your life, and reclaim a sense of control. *Important: you control the pace of this work. You don't have to delve into details before you're ready.*
* **Breast Cancer Survivorship:**  Cancer is a traumatic experience. Therapy can help with:
    * **Processing the trauma:** Dealing with fear of recurrence, changes in body image, grief, and loss.
    * **Emotional adjustment:**  Managing anxiety, depression, and the emotional aftermath of treatment.
    * **Finding meaning & post-traumatic growth:**  Exploring how the experience has changed you and finding ways to move forward with a renewed sense of purpose.
* **Insomnia:**  While Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is often very effective, your therapist will also explore how your trauma, anxiety, and depression are *contributing* to the insomnia.  Addressing the root causes is crucial.
* **Depression & Anxiety:**  These can be addressed with various therapies, including:
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Helps identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.
    * **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):**  Focuses on accepting difficult thoughts and feelings and committing to values-based action.
    * **Psychodynamic Therapy:** Explores underlying patterns and unresolved conflicts that may be contributing to your depression and anxiety.
* **Low Self-Esteem:**  This will likely be addressed throughout therapy, as you process your trauma and learn to challenge negative self-beliefs.  Therapy can help you develop self-compassion and recognize your worth.
* **Your Marriage:** The fact that you have a happy marriage is a *huge* asset.  While individual therapy is a great starting point, couples therapy down the line could be beneficial to help you both navigate the impact of your individual healing journeys on your relationship.



**What to Do Now – Finding a Therapist**

1. **Look for a Therapist with Expertise:**  Specifically seek someone with experience in:
    * **Trauma-informed care:**  This is *essential* given your history of abuse.
    * **Cancer survivorship:**  Ideally, someone who understands the unique challenges faced by cancer survivors.
    * **Depression and Anxiety:**
    * **Insomnia:** (CBT-I is a bonus)
2. **Consider Different Types of Therapists:**  
    * **Psychologists (PhD or PsyD):**  Typically focus on therapy and psychological testing.
    * **Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSW):**  Often have a more holistic approach, considering social and environmental factors.
    * **Licensed Professional Counselors (LPC):**  Provide a range of counseling services.
    * **Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists (LMFT):**  May"
"I'm in my late teens and live with my dad. The only time I go out is for my college classes. Sometimes when I see my friends I want to talk with them, but sometimes I won't want to talk to them for days or even weeks.    Sometimes I feel i'm not worth knowing or i'm never going to do anything right.
   Are they right, am I depressed?","I'm alway wary of assigning a term to a feeling, as often that term becomes more important than the feeling itself. From the very little that you have written, it is clear that you are going through something that has made you extremely low, affected your self-esteem and motivation, limits your enjoyment of formerly pleasurable activities and affects your feelings of self-worth. All of these are aspects of being depressed, though you can be depressed and still not have ""depression"". Counseling is definitely a place where you can go and sort out why you have had such a sudden a drastic change to your mood. Sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine, losses or significant disappointments. Talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way, but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the future. I do hope that you will reach out. Feeling alone can be harmful over long periods of time, as it can stop us from seeking out the support we need.","Okay, this sounds really tough, and it's good you're reaching out, even just by writing this. It takes courage to acknowledge these feelings. Let's break down what you've said and try to figure things out.  I'm not a medical professional, so I can't *diagnose* you, but I can offer some insight and suggest next steps.

**Let's look at what you've described:**

* **Social Withdrawal with Fluctuations:**  Wanting to be with friends *sometimes* but then pulling away for extended periods is a common pattern, but it's also a flag. It's not necessarily ""wrong,"" but it's worth exploring *why* it's happening.  Are you anxious about social situations? Do you feel drained afterward?  Do you worry about what you'll say or how you'll be perceived?
* **Negative Self-Talk:** This is the really important part. Saying you're ""not worth knowing"" or ""never going to do anything right"" is *extremely* harsh.  Those are core beliefs that are causing you pain, and they're likely not based in reality.  They're *thoughts*, not facts.  They're a sign that something is definitely going on internally.
* **Limited Social Life:**  Your only regular outings are for college. This can contribute to feelings of isolation, even if you sometimes prefer being alone.  A healthy life usually includes some regular, enjoyable social interaction.
* **Living with Dad:** While there's nothing inherently wrong with living with your dad, it's worth considering if the living situation is contributing to any of these feelings. Is there pressure, difficulty communicating, or a lack of personal space?



**Are your friends right?**

Absolutely not. Your friends are likely *not* right.  Even if they *said* something negative (which isn't okay if they did), their opinions don't define your worth.  People often project their own insecurities onto others, and sometimes friends aren't equipped to offer the support you need.  The things you're saying *to yourself* are the problem, not what others might think.  Negative self-talk is powerful and can be incredibly damaging.

**Are you depressed?**

It's *possible* you are experiencing depression, but only a professional can say for sure.  What you're describing overlaps with several symptoms of depression, especially:

* **Persistent Sadness or Low Mood:** While you haven't explicitly said you're sad all the time, the negative self-talk suggests a deeply unhappy internal state.
* **Loss of Interest or Pleasure:**  The fluctuating desire to see friends could be related to a loss of enjoyment in activities you once liked.
* **Feelings of Worthlessness or Guilt:**  Your statements about not being worth knowing and not doing things right are classic signs.
* **Social Withdrawal:**  Pulling away from friends and relying solely on college for social interaction.
* **Changes in Energy Levels:** Depression can manifest as fatigue or feeling drained, which might explain why socializing feels exhausting.

**However, it's also important to remember:**

* **Everyone feels down sometimes:**  Having a bad day or a bad week doesn't necessarily mean you're depressed.
* **There's a spectrum:** Depression isn't always a severe, debilitating illness. It can range from mild to severe.
* **Other things can cause these feelings:**  Stress, anxiety, grief, or difficult life circumstances can also lead to similar symptoms.



**What should you do next?  Here's a plan:**

1. **Talk to someone:** This is the most important step. Here are some options:
   * **Your Dad:** If you have a good relationship with your dad, try talking to him.  You don't have to lay everything out at once, but start by saying you've been struggling with some difficult feelings.
   * **A School Counselor:** Your college likely has counseling services available *for free*. This is a great place to start.  They are trained to help students with mental health concerns.  Look on your college's website for ""counseling services,"" ""student health center,"" or ""wellness center.""
   * **A Therapist:**  If school counseling isn't enough or doesn't feel like a good fit, consider finding a therapist in your area. You may need your parents’ help with this.
   * **A Trusted Teacher/Professor:**  If you have a teacher you feel comfortable with, they might be able to offer support or point you towards resources.
   * **A Crisis Line:**  If you're feeling overwhelmed or having thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out to a crisis line immediately. (See resources at the end).

2. **Keep a Journal:**"
"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?","This is a great question. Finding the right therapist can be tricky because you don't really know how someone will be like until you meet them. A few ways to prescreen are to:- Visit the therapist's website, psychologytoday profile, social media, etc...- Have a phone call with the therapist prior to your first appointmentOnce you meet your therapist it is important to be clear with your wishes and expectations. We are trained in helping you thrive in your life but we cannot mind read so if you don't tell us, we won't know. Don't be shy about what you like and what you don't like. A good therapist will listen to your needs, process them with you, and create a customized plan that works for you and your life. A good therapist will also not take anything you say (even criticism) personally. Coming to therapy is hard and often times you might not want to go. What makes a good therapist is someone who understands this and tries to make you feel as comfortable as possible while you address uncomfortable topics.","Okay, these are *excellent* questions. Finding the right therapist and then actively working *with* them to get the most out of therapy are both really important. Let's break down both parts:

**Part 1: How Do You Know You Have the Right Therapist?**

It's not about finding a ""perfect"" therapist, it's about finding a *good fit*.  Here are the key indicators. It's often a feeling, but grounded in specific observations.  It often takes a few sessions to tell:

* **You Feel Safe and Comfortable:** This is paramount. Do you feel like you can be vulnerable with this person without judgment? Can you say difficult things without fearing a negative reaction? This doesn't mean they agree with everything you do, but they accept *you*.
* **You Feel Heard and Understood:**  Not just that they're *listening*, but that they're actively trying to understand *your* perspective.  They should reflect back your feelings and thoughts in a way that feels accurate.  (e.g., ""So, it sounds like when your mom said that, you felt really dismissed and hurt."")
* **They Demonstrate Competence:**  This means they have the appropriate training and licensure for your needs.  (e.g., a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC), Licensed Psychologist (PhD or PsyD)).  Beyond credentials, do they seem knowledgeable about the issues you're bringing up?
* **You Agree with Their Approach:** Different therapists use different modalities (CBT, psychodynamic, humanistic, etc.).  Do their methods resonate with you?  They should explain their approach and *why* they think it will be helpful for you.  If you're not sure, ask them about different approaches.
* **They are Collaborative:** Therapy isn’t something *done to* you, it's something you do *with* your therapist. They should be asking for your input on goals, progress, and what's working (or not working) in sessions.
* **You Sense Hope:**  Even when dealing with difficult topics, a good therapist should instill a sense of hope that change is possible.
* **They Respect Boundaries:** They adhere to professional boundaries (confidentiality, appropriate self-disclosure, etc.).
* **You're Making *Some* Progress (Eventually):**  It won't be linear, but over time, you should notice *something* shifting, even if it's just a new awareness or a slightly different perspective.  This doesn't mean feeling ""fixed,"" but that you're moving forward.

**Red Flags:**

* **Judgment or Criticism:** A therapist should not be judging your values, beliefs, or choices.
* **Giving Unsolicited Advice:**  A good therapist helps you find *your* answers, not tells you what to do. (There are exceptions to this – if you are in immediate danger, for example)
* **Dominating the Conversation:** Sessions should be primarily focused on *you*.
* **Breaching Confidentiality:** (Unless legally required, like reporting child abuse)
* **Discomfort Talking About Sensitive Topics:** They need to be able to handle what you bring up.
* **Ignoring Your Concerns:** If you express discomfort with something, they should address it.



**Part 2: ""Training"" Your Therapist - How to Get What You Need**

This is a fantastic way to think about it! You're not a passive recipient of therapy; you're an active participant.  Here's how to guide your therapist towards being more effective *for you*:

1. **Be Explicit About Your Goals:**
   * **At the beginning:** Clearly state what you want to get out of therapy.  ""I want to learn coping mechanisms for my anxiety,"" or ""I want to understand why I keep repeating unhealthy relationship patterns.""
   * **Regularly revisit them:**  ""Are we still on track with my goal of...?  I'm starting to feel like we're getting off course.""

2. **Give Feedback - Regularly!**  This is the *most* important thing.
   * **During Sessions:**  ""That felt a little off-base for me.""  ""Could we explore that a bit more?""  ""I'm not sure I understand what you mean by that.""  ""I’d like to spend more time on [topic].""
   * **After Sessions:**  You can even jot down notes after a session about what felt helpful and what didn't.  Bring those notes to the next session.  “I was thinking about our session yesterday, and I realized I still feel confused about…”
   * **Be Direct, But Kind:**  You can be honest without being accusatory.  Instead of ""You're not listening to me!"" try """
"Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  Am I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal.","You need to find an outlet. Someone to talk to. Your dad or someone who loves your mother as well is someone ideal. But anyone could help. Just look to someone for help. If you can't find anyone who you think will listen, talk to your mom. It can help greatly just to get the words out. Tell her how you feel about her passing, but then also about everything else. Talk to her about your day. Tell her about happy things. I don't know if you're a religious person, or where you believe she is now, but no matter what you can talk to her.","Okay, this is a really important and surprisingly common experience. You are *absolutely not* crazy for feeling this way. In fact, it's quite insightful and thoughtful to grapple with the implications of eternity, even (and perhaps *especially*) within a framework that promises it. It's understandable that the idea of endless existence, even a blissful one, could trigger anxiety. Here's a breakdown of why this is happening, why your reaction is normal, and some ways to cope.

**Why This Is Happening - And Why It's Not ""Crazy""**

* **The Scale of Eternity is Difficult to Grasp:**  Humans are wired to think in terms of finite time. We understand beginnings, middles, and ends. Even long lifespans are still *limited*.  The concept of *forever* is beyond our ability to truly comprehend. Our brains struggle with infinity. It's like trying to visualize a number bigger than all other numbers – it just breaks down.
* **Loss of Identity Concerns:** You've touched on something really profound.  Even in a ""good"" eternity, the idea of *you* – with your specific personality, memories, and experiences – continuing *exactly* as you are, indefinitely, can be unsettling.  What does it mean to be ""you"" without change, without growth, without the contrast of impermanence?  Some people fear losing what makes them *them* over such a vast expanse of time.
* **The Imposition of a Premise:** You were raised with a specific belief system.  Now, you're *thinking* about that belief system, actively engaging with it.  That's healthy! But it also means you're realizing the weight of the premise.  Even if you intellectually accept the idea of heaven, your emotional and psychological self is questioning its implications.  You're not rejecting faith necessarily, but you're critically examining it.
* **Control & Uncertainty:** Anxiety often stems from a feeling of lack of control.  The idea of an afterlife, especially one dictated by rules and judgments, can feel like a loss of control over your ultimate destiny.  Even a 'positive' destiny feels less comforting if it's not *your* choice.  Uncertainty about the specifics of that afterlife can also feed anxiety.
* **Existential Anxiety:** This is a natural human experience.  We all, at some point, contemplate our mortality and the meaning of life.  Your upbringing has framed this existential anxiety within a specific context, but the underlying feelings are universal.



**Why It Feels ""Not Normal"" (And Why That's Okay)**

You feel it's not normal because:

* **It's not a commonly *discussed* anxiety:** People often don't talk about being overwhelmed by the prospect of eternal life, especially if they are religious. There can be a fear of appearing to question faith or of being judged.
* **It challenges the expected reaction:**  You're *supposed* to find comfort in the idea of heaven.  Feeling anxiety about it feels like a failure to believe properly.

But it's normal in the sense that it's a logical response to a profoundly complex idea, particularly when that idea is presented as a certainty.  Many people struggle with the implications of their religious beliefs when they start to think critically.



**What Can You Do? Coping Strategies**

1. **Acknowledge and Validate Your Feelings:**  The most important thing!  Stop telling yourself you *shouldn't* feel this way.  Say to yourself, ""It's okay that this is causing me anxiety. It's a big concept, and my reaction is understandable.""
2. **Journaling:**  Write down your thoughts and feelings.  Don't censor yourself.  Just get it all out.  Sometimes, seeing your fears on paper can help you to process them.
3. **Mindfulness and Grounding Techniques:** When you start to spiral into panic, use grounding techniques.  These bring you back to the present moment:
    * **5-4-3-2-1 Method:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:** Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system.
    * **Focus on Physical Sensations:**  Feel your feet on the ground, the texture of your clothing, the temperature of the air.
4. **Explore Different Perspectives (If You're Open To It):**  This doesn't mean abandoning your faith, but it might involve:
    * **Reading about different theological viewpoints:**  Are there interpretations of heaven that emphasize transformation and growth rather than static perfection?
    * **Exploring philosophies of impermanence:**  Buddhist philosophy, for example"
"Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me?","Yes, it is very normal to cry during a therapy appointment.  When you meet with a counselor, you are opening yourself up and sharing very vulnerable sides of yourself.  Through this deep introspection, emotions (sometimes unexpected) can come out and this is completely okay and very healthy.  Research has shown that crying reduces pain by releasing oxytocin and endorphins and reduces stress through the release of stress reduction hormones.","Okay, let's address this! It is **absolutely normal** to cry during therapy. In fact, it's *very* common. You are definitely not alone in experiencing this. Here's a breakdown of why, and what it means, to hopefully reassure you:

**Why people cry in therapy:**

* **Safe Space:** Therapy is designed to be a safe, non-judgmental space.  Often, it's the first time people feel comfortable enough to really *feel* their emotions, and to let them out, without fear of being judged or told to ""be strong.""  You're giving yourself permission to be vulnerable.
* **Processing Difficult Emotions:** You're likely in therapy to work through things that are painful, challenging, or traumatic.  Bringing those things up naturally stirs up emotions, and crying is a natural release.
* **Release of Pent-Up Feelings:**  Many people suppress their emotions in daily life. Therapy provides an opportunity to release those pent-up feelings that haven't had an outlet.  It's like a pressure valve being opened.
* **Grief & Loss:** Even if you're not consciously focusing on a specific loss, therapy can sometimes unlock feelings of grief related to past experiences, lost opportunities, or unfulfilled needs.
* **Realization & Insight:** Sometimes, crying happens *with* a realization.  You might suddenly understand something about yourself or your past in a new way, and that understanding can be incredibly emotional.
* **Connection with the Therapist:** A good therapist creates a strong therapeutic relationship. Feeling safe and connected to your therapist can make it easier to access and express emotions.
* **Simply Feeling Heard:**  Just being truly *heard* and validated by another person can be profoundly moving and lead to tears.



**What it *doesn't* mean (things people worry about):**

* **It doesn't mean you're weak:**  Quite the opposite! It takes strength to confront your emotions and allow yourself to feel them.
* **It doesn't mean you're ""crazy"" or overly sensitive:**  Everyone experiences emotions differently, and there's a wide range of what's considered ""normal.""
* **It doesn't mean you're making your therapist uncomfortable:**  Experienced therapists are used to clients crying. They have training to handle it with sensitivity and support.  (Though, if *you* feel your therapist is reacting negatively, that's a different issue we can discuss.)
* **It doesn't mean you're not making progress:** Crying can *be* progress. It means you're engaging with the work.

**What to do if you're worried about crying in therapy:**

* **It's okay to acknowledge it:**  You can say something like, ""I feel like I might cry,"" or ""I'm feeling overwhelmed.""  Your therapist will likely respond with empathy and support.
* **Ask your therapist:** If you're concerned, ask them directly!  ""Is it normal to cry in therapy?"" or ""I've noticed I've been crying a lot lately in sessions, is that okay?""  They can offer reassurance and explain why it might be happening.
* **Don't apologize for it:**  Your emotions are valid.  There's no need to apologize for feeling them.
* **Have tissues handy:** Practical, but helpful!
* **Remember your coping skills:** If you have coping mechanisms for managing strong emotions (deep breathing, grounding exercises, etc.), you can use them during or after a crying spell.



**In short:  Crying in therapy is incredibly common and usually a sign that the therapy is working.**  It's a natural and healthy way to process emotions.  

If you're feeling embarrassed or ashamed, please try to let that go. You're doing important work, and allowing yourself to feel is a crucial part of the process.



Is there anything specific about *your* experience of crying in therapy that makes you wonder if it's normal?  Knowing a little more about *your* situation might help me give you even more tailored reassurance. For example:

*   How often are you crying?
*   What triggers the crying?
*   Do you feel comfortable with your therapist?
*   Are you worried about what your therapist thinks?"
"My friend is abusing her prescription medicine. Even though she told me she didn't have any more pills, I found she has prescriptions for anxiety medications.","Your good intentions to help your friend stay clean, are very caring about her.Unless your friend feels like stopping pills,  taking them away will mean she finds them some place else.The problem that anyone who is addicted to pills has, is that the person is psychologically and at least with xanax, physically addicted.Taking pills has basically become a standard part of your friend's life.Her problem is bigger than your ability to care.If you haven't already done so, tell your friend directly about your opinion on the way she is using pills.This is not a guarantee that she'll stop.It isa way of you showing that you care about her.Offering love and advice are the only things you can do for her.Meanwhile, knowing she is hurting herself is probably hurting you.Be sure to keep a sense of balance within yourself.  Offer your concern and know she is the one who must decide to stop using.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and you're a good friend for being concerned and for reaching out. It's incredibly difficult to witness a friend struggling with prescription drug abuse, especially when they're not being honest about it. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering your concerns, how to help, and taking care of yourself, broken down into sections.  I'll also include resources at the end.

**1. Understanding the Situation & Your Concerns**

* **It's Abuse, Even with a Prescription:** The fact that she *has* prescriptions doesn't negate the abuse. Abuse means taking medication in a way it wasn't prescribed – higher doses, more frequently, for a different reason than intended, or continuing to take it even when it's causing problems.
* **Deception is a Red Flag:**  Her telling you she was out of pills and then discovering she has refills is a major concern. It indicates she's hiding her use and potentially feels ashamed or doesn't want to face the consequences.  This makes it harder to help, but also underscores the seriousness of the problem.
* **Anxiety Medications are Often Abused:**  Benzodiazepines (like Xanax, Ativan, Valium) and even some antidepressants are often misused for their sedative effects or to self-medicate.  They can be very dangerous, especially when combined with other substances or when taken improperly.
* **Potential Dangers:**  Prescription drug abuse can lead to:
    * **Physical Dependence:**  The body adapts to the drug, leading to withdrawal symptoms if stopped suddenly.
    * **Overdose:**  Especially dangerous when combined with alcohol or other drugs.
    * **Mental Health Worsening:**  Abuse can exacerbate anxiety and depression, creating a vicious cycle.
    * **Long-Term Health Problems:**  Organ damage, cognitive impairment, etc.
    * **Legal Issues:**  Depending on how she's obtaining and using the medication.



**2. How to Talk to Her (This is the Hard Part)**

* **Choose the Right Time and Place:**  Find a private, quiet setting where you won't be interrupted.  Don't do it when either of you are stressed, tired, or under the influence of anything.
* **Express Your Concern, Not Judgment:**  This is *crucial*.  Start by saying you care about her and are worried about her well-being.  Avoid accusatory language like ""You're addicted"" or ""You're ruining your life.""  Instead, try:
    * ""I've noticed [specific behavior, e.g., you seemed really anxious lately, you've been withdrawn], and I'm concerned about you.""
    * ""I was surprised to learn you still have your anxiety medication, especially after you said you were out. I'm worried about what's going on.""
    * ""I'm worried about how you've been coping with things, and I want you to know I'm here for you.""
* **Share Your Observation (Gently):**  ""I found out you have refills for your anxiety medication, and it concerned me because you had told me you didn't have any left. I’m worried you might be relying on them more than you intended.""
* **Listen Without Interrupting:**  Let her explain her side, even if it's difficult to hear.  Try to understand what's driving her behavior.  Is she feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or trying to cope with trauma?
* **Focus on ""I"" Statements:**  ""I feel scared when I see..."" instead of ""You make me scared...""
* **Avoid Enabling:**  Do *not* help her get more pills, cover for her, or minimize her behavior.  This will only perpetuate the problem.
* **Be Prepared for Denial or Anger:**  She might get defensive, deny there's a problem, or even get angry with you.  Try to remain calm and reiterate your concern.  You can say, ""I understand you're upset, but I'm saying this because I care about you.""
* **Don’t try to be her therapist:** You are a friend, and your role is to express concern and encourage her to seek professional help.



**3. Encouraging Her to Get Help**

* **Suggest Professional Help:**  This is the most important step.  She needs to talk to a doctor, therapist, or addiction specialist.  Here are some ways to phrase it:
    * ""I really think talking to a doctor or therapist could help you sort through what's going on.""
    * ""There are people who specialize in helping with these kinds of situations. Would you be open to exploring some options?""
    * ""I'm worried about your health, and I think"
"When my boyfriend gets in a snit, he gives me the silent treatment for days. When I ask what is wrong, I get nothing: no reply, no phone call. If he does reply, it is something very sarcastic and hurtful. He never admits he is wrong and never apologizes.","You are in an abusive relationship-not because of your boyfriend's silences but because he is comfortable being sarcastic and hurtful, never admits he is wrong and never apologizes. It is your choice to participate in an abusive relationship. You can not stop an abusive partner from being abusive no matter how wonderfully you treat your partner. You can either accept the terrible relationship as it is or reach out for the support that you need to leave the abusive relationship. I wish you well, always.","Okay, this sounds incredibly difficult and emotionally draining. What you're describing – the silent treatment, sarcasm, hurtful comments, lack of accountability, and absence of apology – is a form of emotional abuse. It's important to recognize that, even if it doesn't involve physical violence, it's still damaging and unhealthy. Here's a breakdown of why this is problematic, what it's doing to you, and what your options are.  I'll try to be thorough.  This is a long response, but the situation warrants it.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Emotional Abuse:**  The silent treatment is a control tactic. It's a way for your boyfriend to punish you, exert power over you, and avoid healthy communication.  The sarcasm and hurtful comments are direct emotional attacks.  The refusal to take responsibility is a hallmark of someone who doesn't want to address their own behavior or the impact it has on others.
* **Control & Power Dynamics:** He's controlling the situation by withholding affection, communication, and validation. You're left feeling anxious, confused, and desperate for a resolution *that he controls*. You're chasing after something he's intentionally keeping from you.
* **Gaslighting (potentially):** The sarcastic and hurtful replies, combined with the refusal to acknowledge your feelings or his wrongdoing, can be a form of gaslighting. Gaslighting is making you question your own reality, sanity, or perception. He's essentially telling you (without directly saying it) that your feelings are invalid or that you're overreacting.
* **Unhealthy Communication Patterns:** Healthy relationships thrive on open, honest, and respectful communication. What you're experiencing is the opposite. There's no dialogue, no compromise, and no attempt to understand each other's perspectives.
* **Erosion of Self-Esteem:** Being constantly on the receiving end of this behavior can significantly erode your self-esteem. You might start to question your worth, blame yourself for his reactions, and feel like you're walking on eggshells to avoid triggering him.



**How This Impacts *You***

* **Anxiety and Stress:**  The uncertainty of not knowing what's wrong and the fear of his reactions will create chronic anxiety and stress.
* **Self-Doubt:**  You'll likely start to second-guess yourself and your instincts.
* **Emotional Exhaustion:**  Constantly trying to navigate his moods and placate him is incredibly draining.
* **Isolation:**  You might withdraw from friends and family because you're embarrassed or afraid to talk about what's happening. Or, you might be preoccupied with the relationship to the exclusion of other connections.
* **Depression:** Prolonged emotional abuse can contribute to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and depression.
* **Difficulty Trusting:** This experience can make it difficult to trust others in the future.



**What You Can Do (and this is broken down into sections)**

**1. Stop Chasing & Change *Your* Behavior (This is the hardest, but most important first step)**

* **Break the Cycle:** You've already identified that asking what's wrong gets you nowhere.  *Stop asking.*  As difficult as it is, continuing to seek explanation reinforces his behavior. He's learned that silence is ""rewarded"" with your attempts to fix things.
* **Don't Engage in the Sarcasm:** Don't respond to sarcastic or hurtful comments with defensiveness or attempts to argue.  These only escalate the situation.  A simple, neutral response like, “I don’t appreciate being spoken to that way,” and then *disengaging* is best. (See ""Grey Rocking"" below).
* **Focus on Your Own Wellbeing:**  When he's giving you the silent treatment, redirect your energy towards self-care. Spend time with friends and family, pursue hobbies, exercise, or do anything that brings you joy.  This isn't about punishing him; it's about protecting yourself.
* **Set Boundaries (and enforce them):**  This is crucial.  A boundary is a limit you set for acceptable behavior. Examples:
    * ""I will not tolerate being spoken to with sarcasm or disrespect.""
    * ""I need to be able to communicate openly and honestly in this relationship. If you're unwilling to do that, we need to re-evaluate things.""
    * ""I will not chase after you when you give me the silent treatment. I need a partner who communicates with me.""
   * **Enforcing boundaries is the hard part.**  It means consistently upholding your limits, even when it's uncomfortable. If he's sarcastic, you *end the conversation.* If he gives you the silent treatment, you *continue with your life.*

**2.  ""Grey Rocking"" Technique**"
"My ex-fiancé (whom I am still seeing) left me because of the pressure from all three of his teenage daughters. They wanted him to try to work it out with their mom (his ex-girlfriend of 20 years). He and I split three months ago, but I have been seeing him pretty regularly despite the fact that he is living back with his ex-girlfriend and kids. He is ""co-existing"" for the kids and fighting all the time with his ex-girlfriend. His daughters don’t want their dad with me because my two boys (grown adults and on their own now) had bad reputations and issues with drugs. His daughters say it is embarrassing for him to be with me. He and I had an absolutely amazing relationship and connect on so many levels. He is getting a lot of pressure from his family and his longtime friends to ""do the right thing"" and stay with his ex-girlfriend for the kids. He says he wants me to wait. We were going get married last year. He bought me a $1000 dress, we had invitations made, and everything set up, but then his girls told him they'd never speak to him again if he married me. He says he’s trying to mend his relationship with them.","Hello. It seems you are in a set of circumstances that are highly uncomfortable for you. Do you feel those circumstances are healthy? Do you find pleasure being in such a place of uncertainty? Why do you continue to be in this situation? Without meaning to appear that I might be lacking in compassion, you do have the option to leave the connection completely if the harm it is doing is more that the pleasure it brings you. Is there a benefit to being in this relationship? Do you consider this situation to be for your highest good? Is it healthy to be involved in something that is not likely healthy or perhaps could even be seen as dysfunctional? In truth, only you can decide the answers to these very important questions. I would encourage you to think of who benefits by being in this situation, and how you might be able to find happiness in other relationships that are healthier and more positive. In my clinical view based on what I read, this particular relationship does not carry the joy I am sure you want, nor the healthy interactions you would expect in a functional romantic engagement with another person.Beating yourself up about potentially wasting all this time waiting for the other person to come around will not serve a positive purpose. It likely will only lower your self-esteem. There is a time to wait to see how things develop, and a time to move on to other experiences. You are the one to make that choice, but I would encourage you to connect with your inner higher self, for the most clear answer. Chances are, you already know the answer, you just need to embrace it. Getting in touch with a counselor in your area can also help ferret out some of the deeper issues that you might not have felt comfortable expressing here.","Okay, this is a *really* tough situation, and a really common one - the pull between new love and family obligation. It sounds incredibly painful and frustrating for you, and honestly, quite unfair. Let's break down what's happening and what you need to consider.  I'm going to be honest, and likely tell you things you don't *want* to hear, but hopefully things you *need* to hear.

**What's Happening Here – The Dynamics at Play**

* **He's trapped in a loyalty bind:** He's caught between his daughters, his ex-girlfriend, and you. He clearly feels a very strong sense of obligation to his children, likely amplified by the length of his relationship with their mother.
* **His daughters have *a lot* of power:**  They essentially issued an ultimatum and he caved. This sets a dangerous precedent.  It teaches them that emotional manipulation is effective, and it undermines his own agency.
* **His ex-girlfriend is a factor, but maybe not the primary one:** While the fighting suggests a difficult dynamic with her, the core issue appears to be pleasing his daughters. He's using ""co-existing"" as a justification, but the real driver seems to be avoiding his daughters' disapproval.
* **Your past is being used as a shield:** The issues with your sons, even if they are in the past and resolved, are being unfairly leveraged against you. It's likely easier for him to blame external factors (your sons’ past) than to stand up to his daughters.
* **He’s prioritizing avoiding conflict over his own happiness (and yours):**  Choosing the path of least resistance *right now* is his strategy, even though it's creating long-term misery for everyone involved.
* **The ""wait"" is a stall tactic:** He wants to keep you on the hook while he attempts to navigate this impossible situation. He’s hoping for a miracle where his daughters change their minds.
* **You are being emotionally strung along.** You are in a painful limbo, repeatedly investing emotionally in someone who is unable to fully commit to you.



**Why This Is So Damaging to *You***

* **It's disrespectful:**  He prioritized his daughters' feelings *over* your feelings and a relationship he was actively planning to marry you in.  That’s a fundamental lack of respect.
* **It erodes your self-worth:** Being kept as a ""maybe"" while he sorts out his family drama is incredibly damaging to your self-esteem.  You deserve someone who chooses you wholeheartedly.
* **It prevents you from moving on:**  As long as you’re waiting, you're not available to meet someone who *can* fully commit to you.
* **The situation is unlikely to magically resolve:**  Teenagers are often deeply entrenched in their opinions. Expecting a complete 180 from them is unrealistic, and basing your future on that expectation is setting yourself up for further disappointment.
* **It's a deeply unhealthy dynamic.** A relationship built on guilt, obligation, and the need to appease others is not a strong foundation.




**What You Need to Do (The Hard Truths)**

1. **Stop Seeing Him (or drastically reduce contact):** This is the hardest, but most crucial step.  Every time you see him, you reinforce the idea that you're okay with this arrangement. You're giving him permission to continue stringing you along.  Implement a *firm* boundary.  This doesn’t mean you hate him; it means you respect yourself.  You can say something like, “I need space to heal and move forward. I can’t continue seeing you while you’re living with [ex-girlfriend] and trying to navigate this situation with your daughters. It’s too painful for me.”
2. **Recognize the Pattern:** He’s shown you that he’s willing to sacrifice your happiness for the sake of avoiding conflict with his family.  This is a pattern, and it’s unlikely to change.
3. **Challenge the ""He's a Good Man"" Narrative:**  You say you had an amazing relationship, and that's wonderful. But being a good person doesn't excuse making consistently poor choices that harm others, including you.
4. **Focus on Yourself:**  Redirect your energy into things that bring *you* joy and fulfillment.  Spend time with friends, pursue hobbies, focus on your own well-being.  
5. **Consider Therapy:** A therapist can provide a safe space to process your emotions, develop coping mechanisms, and build healthy boundaries.
6. **Accept the Loss:**  As painful as it is, you need to accept that the future you envisioned with him is likely not going to happen. Grieving the loss of the relationship is essential.

"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?","Finding the right therapist can be difficult, especially if you've never tried it before. Things to consider are location, availability and what specifically are you looking for. Some practitioners specifically only work with a certain type of issue (i.e eating disorders, adolescents, anger management, life transitions, anxiety...etc) and others can work with a variety of concerns. As far as training your therapist, you can't. You simply let them know what you are looking to work on or what you think may be an issue for you. Depending on the way they practice(their style of working with clients) is how they will then decide to make a treatment plan that works best for you. You can always ask them their specialty practice population, the problems they generally help others with and what type of mental health provider they are (Psychologist, social worker, licensed mental health counselor).","Okay, you're asking two really important questions! Finding the right therapist and then actively working *with* them to get the most out of therapy are both crucial for success. Let's break down each part.

## How Do You Know You Have the Right Therapist?

It's not always immediate, and it's okay to ""shop around.""  It's like finding a good doctor - sometimes the first one isn't the best fit. Here are some key indicators you've found a good match:

**1. The ""Feeling"" - The Therapeutic Alliance:** This is *hugely* important.
   * **You feel safe and comfortable:**  Can you talk openly and honestly without fear of judgment? Do you feel respected?  This doesn't mean you have to *like* your therapist, but you need to feel safe enough to be vulnerable.
   * **You feel understood:**  Do they genuinely seem to *get* you and your experiences?  Do they reflect back what you're saying in a way that feels accurate?
   * **You feel a connection:** This isn't about being friends. It's a sense of rapport, that you can work together.
   * **Trust is building:** Do you believe they have your best interests at heart?

**2. Practical Considerations:**
   * **Credentials & Expertise:** Are they licensed and qualified to practice? Do they have experience with the issues you're facing (anxiety, depression, trauma, relationship problems, etc.)?  (Look for licenses like LMFT, LCSW, LPC, Psychologist, Psychiatrist - understanding what each means is helpful).
   * **Therapeutic Approach:** Different therapists use different approaches (CBT, Psychodynamic, Humanistic, etc.). Do their approach align with what you’re looking for or what you've read about?  (You don't need to be an expert, but knowing *something* is good).
   * **Logistics:** Do their fees work with your budget?  Are their hours convenient? Do you like the format (in-person, telehealth)?
   * **Clear Expectations:**  Did they explain their policies, confidentiality, and how therapy works?

**3. Early Progress (Even Small):**
   *  You don't need to be ""cured"" quickly, but after a few sessions, you should feel *something* shifting.  Maybe a little more clarity, a slightly different perspective, or even just feeling heard.
   *  Are you starting to identify patterns in your thoughts/feelings/behaviors? Is the therapist helping you with that?



**Red Flags (Signs it's *not* a good fit):**

*   **Judgment or Criticism:** They invalidate your feelings or tell you what you *should* do.
*   **Giving Advice Instead of Exploring:**  Good therapy is about *you* finding your answers, not the therapist telling you what to do.  (A little guidance is okay, but it shouldn't be constant).
*   **Talking About Themselves Too Much:** The focus should be on you, not their life.
*   **Breaking Confidentiality:** (This is a serious ethical violation.)
*   **Consistently Feeling Worse:** While therapy can bring up difficult emotions, it shouldn't consistently leave you feeling worse *without* a clear path towards processing those feelings.
* **Ignoring your feedback:** If you express a concern and it's dismissed.




## How to ""Train"" Your Therapist (Actively Shaping Your Treatment)

This is a fantastic question! It's *completely* okay – and encouraged – to take an active role in your therapy.  Think of it less like ""training"" and more like *collaborative communication*. Here's how:

**1.  Be Specific About Your Goals:**
   * **At the beginning:**  ""I want to work on my anxiety, specifically social anxiety, and learn coping mechanisms to feel more comfortable in social situations.""
   * **Ongoing:** ""This week, I'd like to spend some time exploring why I get so anxious before presentations.""

**2. Give Feedback – Regularly!**  This is the most important part.
   * **During Session:** ""That question didn't quite resonate with me. Could we try approaching it from a different angle?""  ""I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'cognitive distortion' – can you explain that in a simpler way?""  ""Could we slow down a little? I'm feeling overwhelmed.""
   * **Between Sessions (if appropriate):**  Many therapists are open to brief check-ins via email or a patient portal.  ""I've been thinking about our conversation about [topic], and I'd like to discuss it further next session.""
   * **Don't be afraid to say ""That wasn'"
"I have terrible anxiety and depression. I've tried various therapists and pills, but nothing's helped.","Is it possible you simply didn't mix well with the particular therapists with whom you've worked?   If this is possible, interview a therapist before  starting therapy.   Then you will be choosing a therapist who feels compatible with your way of seeing yourself and your life.Also, therapy isn't for everyone.Read about the different healing modalities and see if one of these speaks to your interest in feeling better.What matters most is finding among all the legitimate healing methods, what you believe will be effective.","Okay, that sounds incredibly frustrating and disheartening. You've been putting in the work to get better, trying both therapy and medication, and to still be struggling... that's *really* tough. It takes a lot of courage to keep trying, and I want to acknowledge that right off the bat.  It's completely understandable to feel hopeless when things haven't clicked yet.

First, please know you're not alone. Many people experience treatment-resistant depression and anxiety. It doesn't mean there's something wrong with *you*, it means finding the right path is more complex.

Let's break down some things to consider, and I'll try to offer some avenues to explore.  I'm going to give a fairly comprehensive response, but please remember **I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.** This is information to discuss with qualified professionals.  I'll also include a crisis resource section at the end if you're feeling overwhelmed right now.

**1. Let's Talk About What You've Tried (to help identify potential gaps)**

To give you more tailored suggestions, it would be helpful to understand a bit more about what you've already done.  You don't have to share specifics you're uncomfortable with, but thinking about these things can be useful:

*   **Types of Therapy:** What kinds of therapy have you tried? (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Psychodynamic Therapy, Interpersonal Therapy, EMDR).  Each approach works differently.
*   **Therapist ""Fit"":** Did you feel a strong connection with your therapists?  A good therapeutic relationship is *crucial*. Sometimes it's not about the *type* of therapy, but the *person* delivering it.  Did you feel understood, safe, and challenged appropriately?
*   **Medication:** What medications have you tried, and for how long?  (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, Wellbutrin, anti-anxiety meds).  It often takes time to find the right medication and dosage, and sometimes multiple trials are needed.  Were you working closely with a psychiatrist for medication management?
*   **Dosage and Duration:** Were the medications given enough time to work (often 8-12 weeks or longer)? Were dosages adjusted appropriately?
*   **Lifestyle Factors:**  What's your lifestyle like? (Sleep, diet, exercise, social support, stress levels).  These play a huge role in mental health.
* **Co-occurring conditions:** Have you been evaluated for other conditions that can sometimes mimic or worsen anxiety and depression, like thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies (like Vitamin D or B12), or sleep disorders?



**2. Potential Avenues to Explore (with professional guidance)**

Here are some things that might be worth discussing with a mental health professional, *especially* since you haven't found relief yet:

*   **Different Therapy Modalities:**
    *   **DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy):**  Excellent for emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal skills.  Often helpful if you struggle with intense emotions or self-harm.
    *   **ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy):** Focuses on accepting difficult thoughts and feelings rather than fighting them, and committing to values-based action.
    *   **Schema Therapy:**  Addresses deeply ingrained, negative patterns of thinking and behavior that stem from early life experiences.
    *   **Psychodynamic Therapy:** Explores unconscious patterns and past experiences.
    *   **Neurofeedback:** A type of biofeedback that trains brain activity. It's still considered experimental for depression/anxiety but shows promise for some.
*   **Psychiatrist Re-evaluation:**  It's time for a really thorough medication review with a psychiatrist. Consider:
    *   **Genetic Testing (Pharmacogenomics):**  This can help predict how your body will respond to different medications, potentially speeding up the process of finding the right one.  It's not foolproof, but can be informative.
    *   **Augmentation:**  Adding another medication to your current one to boost its effects.
    *   **Different Classes of Medications:**  There are many antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications beyond the commonly prescribed SSRIs and SNRIs.
    * **Ketamine or Esketamine:** These are newer treatments for treatment-resistant depression, administered under medical supervision.
*   **More Intensive Treatment:**
    *   **Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP):**  A structured program that provides intensive therapy and support during the day, allowing you to return home at night.
    *   **Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP):**  Similar to PHP, but with fewer hours of treatment per week.
    *   **Residential Treatment:**  Living"
"I feel angry, anxious, and depressed. The PTSD I suffer is from a past relationship.","If the symptoms are to the extent that they are affecting your ability to function, you may want to consider seeking treatment. PTSD, anxiety, and depression all typically respond well to treatment if provided by a trained clinician. Common types of treatment for PTSD that you may want to look into include Cognitive Processing Therapy or EMDR. The nice things about Cognitive Processing Therapy is that it is time limited and only lasts 17 sessions typically. ","Okay, that sounds incredibly difficult. It's completely understandable that you're feeling angry, anxious, and depressed, especially with the added layer of PTSD from a past relationship. That's a lot to carry, and it takes courage to even acknowledge it.  It's good you're recognizing these feelings.  Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering understanding, coping, and seeking help.  I'll try to be thorough, but remember I am an AI and cannot provide therapy.  This is information and support, *not* a replacement for professional help.

**1. Understanding What's Happening**

* **PTSD and Relationships:**  Relationship PTSD (often referred to as complex PTSD or cPTSD, though diagnosis varies) is a very real thing. It develops from prolonged or repeated emotional, psychological, or even physical abuse within a relationship.  It's different from single-incident trauma (like a car accident) because the trauma happened within a *connection* – a place where you should have felt safe and loved. This makes it particularly insidious and often harder to process.  It can affect your ability to trust, your self-worth, your emotional regulation, and how you form future relationships.
* **The Interplay of Anger, Anxiety, and Depression:** These often go hand-in-hand with PTSD.
    * **Anger:**  Is often a natural response to injustice, betrayal, and feeling powerless – all common experiences in abusive relationships.  It can be directed at your former partner, yourself (for staying, for not recognizing red flags), or even the world in general.
    * **Anxiety:**  Arises from a heightened sense of threat.  Your nervous system is stuck in ""fight or flight"" even when you're not in immediate danger.  You might be hypervigilant (constantly scanning for threats), easily startled, or experience panic attacks.
    * **Depression:** Can stem from feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, loss, and grief. It's a common reaction to trauma, and the chronic stress of PTSD can deplete your emotional resources.
* **Triggers:**  PTSD is often triggered.  These are things (sights, sounds, smells, dates, places, even emotions) that remind you of the trauma and cause you to re-experience the feelings associated with it.  Identifying your triggers is a key step in managing your symptoms.



**2. Immediate Coping Strategies (When You're Actively Feeling Overwhelmed)**

These are things you can do *in the moment* to help ground yourself.  They won't fix things, but they can help you manage the intensity of your emotions:

* **Grounding Techniques:**  These bring you back to the present moment.
    * **5-4-3-2-1:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths can calm your nervous system.  Try box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4).
    * **Physical Sensations:**  Hold an ice cube, take a warm shower, or wrap yourself in a blanket.  Focus on the physical sensation.
* **Self-Soothing:**
    * **Comforting Activities:**  Listen to calming music, read a book, watch a favorite movie (something light and positive), or take a warm bath.
    * **Journaling:**  Write down your thoughts and feelings.  Don't worry about grammar or structure; just get it out.
    * **Mindfulness:**  Focus on your breath and observe your thoughts and feelings without judgment. (There are many guided mindfulness meditations available online).
* **Distraction (Use Judiciously):**  Sometimes, temporarily distracting yourself can give you a break. However, don't use it to *avoid* your feelings entirely.  Good distractions include spending time with a pet, doing a puzzle, or engaging in a hobby.
* **Safe Space:** If possible, go to a place where you feel safe and comfortable. This could be a room in your home, a friend's house, or a quiet outdoor space.

**3. Longer-Term Healing Strategies**

These take time and effort, but are crucial for recovery:

* **Therapy:** *This is the most important step.*  Specifically, look for therapists who specialize in:
    * **Trauma-Informed Therapy:** This approach recognizes the impact of trauma and avoids re-traumatization.
    * **EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing):**  A highly effective therapy for PTSD.
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**"
"I have a friend that who I used to be in a relationship with. It was brief and turned into us being just good friends.
   I spent the weekend with him and it upset my boyfriend. Was i wrong?","Depends on your definition of ""wrong"" on this one. Was it objectively wrong to spend the weekend with a good friend, who also happens to be an ex? Probably not. But, it upset your current boyfriend, and he is entitled to his feelings if you are in a relationship with him. He may be out of line if he assumes that anything happened between you and your ex that would compromise the relationship, however your boyfriend being upset might also mean that he wanted to spend that kind of weekend with you and did not get to do that.Long story short, it might help your relationship to understand more, and be curious, not judge-y, around what is upsetting for him. Perhaps having empathy for his experience of the behavior could help him to feel more secure with you having relationships with your ex(es).","Okay, this is a really common and tricky situation! It's good you're asking this question and thinking it through. Here's a breakdown of why your boyfriend might be upset, whether you were ""wrong,"" and how to navigate things going forward.  It's a long answer, because it's nuanced, but hopefully thorough.

**Why Your Boyfriend is Likely Upset**

* **History:** The fact that you *were* in a relationship with this friend changes things. Even if it was brief and you're now ""just friends,"" that prior romantic connection carries weight. It introduces a level of complexity that wouldn't exist with a friend you've *never* dated.
* **Insecurity:** Your boyfriend might be feeling insecure. He might be wondering if there are lingering feelings on your end, or if you enjoy the attention of your ex more than his.  This is especially true if he's not super confident or if he's faced similar situations in the past.
* **Boundaries:** He might feel you crossed an unspoken or unestablished boundary by spending a whole weekend alone with your ex. Even if *you* feel comfortable with the friendship, he might not.  He may wonder what you two did, talked about, etc.
* **Respect:**  He might feel a lack of respect for his feelings.  Even if you didn't do anything inappropriate, *going* on a weekend trip with an ex can feel dismissive of his emotions.
* **Comparison:** He might be subconsciously comparing himself to your ex.  He could be wondering why you were attracted to your ex in the first place and how he measures up.
* **Lack of Transparency:** Did you tell him *before* the weekend about your plans, and discuss it with him? If it was a surprise, that would definitely contribute to his upset.



**Were You ""Wrong""?**

This is where it gets tricky.  It's not necessarily about being ""right"" or ""wrong"" in a black-and-white way, but about **thoughtfulness, communication, and respecting your boyfriend's feelings.**

* **If you discussed it with your boyfriend beforehand and he was okay with it (or at least understood),** then you likely weren't ""wrong.""  You had a conversation, he had a chance to express his feelings, and you proceeded with his knowledge.
* **If you didn't tell him, or told him last minute,** then yes, you probably were insensitive.  Even if you had the best intentions, failing to include him in the decision shows a lack of consideration for his feelings.
* **If you assumed it was okay because you're ""just friends,""** that's a common mistake.  Relationships require ongoing communication and negotiation of boundaries. What *you* consider ""just friends"" might be different from what your boyfriend considers acceptable.

**Important Considerations:**

* **The Nature of the Weekend:** What did you *do* all weekend? Was it a purely platonic activity (hiking, a concert with other friends, helping him with a project)? Or was it a lot of one-on-one time, reminiscing, or potentially flirtatious behavior? The nature of the activities matters.
* **Your Boyfriend's Personality:** Is he generally a jealous or insecure person? If so, you need to be extra sensitive and proactive in reassuring him.
* **The Strength of Your Relationship:**  A strong, secure relationship can usually weather these kinds of situations with open communication. A newer or less secure relationship might be more fragile.




**What to Do Now:**

1. **Talk to Your Boyfriend – Really Listen:**  This is the most important step.
   * **Apologize (if appropriate):**  If you didn't discuss it with him beforehand, or if you minimized his feelings, apologize for being insensitive.  Something like, ""I'm really sorry I upset you. I didn't realize how much it would bother you, and I should have talked to you about it before making plans.""  Don't apologize for *having* a friend, apologize for *how* you handled the situation.
   * **Ask him how he's feeling:**  ""Can you help me understand what specifically made you uncomfortable?""  ""What were you worried about when you found out I was spending the weekend with [Ex's Name]?""
   * **Validate his feelings:** Even if you don't agree with his reaction, acknowledge that his feelings are valid.  ""I understand why you'd feel that way."" ""It makes sense that you'd be a little uncomfortable given our history.""
   * **Listen without getting defensive:**  This is hard!  Resist the urge to immediately justify your actions.  Just listen and try to understand his perspective.
   * **Ask what he needs from you going forward:** ""What"
I'm very depressed. How do I find someone to talk to?,"If there is no one in your life with whom you feel comfortable, I would recommend identifying someone on this site, psychology today or goodtherapy.org who is in your area, then give that therapist a call to see if you would be a good match.","Okay, I'm really glad you're reaching out, even just by asking this question. It takes courage to admit you're struggling, and wanting to talk to someone is a *very* positive step.  It's important to remember you're not alone, and there are people who want to help.  Here's a breakdown of how to find someone to talk to, broken down into different levels of support, from immediate help to ongoing support.  I'll also include resources at the end.  **Please read the disclaimer at the very bottom, as I am an AI and cannot provide therapy.**

**1. Immediate Support (If you are in crisis or feeling suicidal):**

*   **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:**  Call or text 988 in the US and Canada. In the UK, you can call 111. This is available 24/7, free, and confidential.  They can provide immediate support and connect you with resources.  **This is the most important option if you are having thoughts of harming yourself.**  Don't hesitate.  They *want* to hear from you.  https://988lifeline.org/
*   **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741.  This is another 24/7, free, and confidential service.  Good if you prefer texting. https://www.crisistextline.org/
*   **The Trevor Project:**  If you are LGBTQ and under 25, you can call 1-866-488-7386 or text START to 678-678. https://www.thetrevorproject.org/
*   **Emergency Room:** If you feel like you are an immediate danger to yourself, go to the nearest emergency room.



**2.  Warm Lines & Peer Support (For non-crisis support, just needing to talk):**

These are good options when you're feeling down but not in immediate danger.  They offer a listening ear and support from people who understand.

*   **Warm Lines:** These are typically run by local mental health organizations and offer non-crisis support.  They're often staffed by people with lived experience of mental health challenges.  A good place to find one is through the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) - see resources below.  (Search ""NAMI [your state] warmline"")
*   **Peer Support Groups:**  Connecting with others who are going through similar experiences can be incredibly validating and helpful. NAMI also offers support groups.  You can find them online or in person.  https://www.nami.org/findsupport

**3.  Professional Help (Ongoing support and therapy):**

This is a good option for addressing the root causes of your depression and developing coping mechanisms.

*   **Your Doctor (Primary Care Physician):**  Start here.  Your doctor can assess your overall health, rule out any medical causes for your depression, and refer you to a mental health professional.
*   **Therapist/Counselor:**
    *   **Psychology Today:**  A great directory to find therapists in your area (or online). You can filter by insurance, specialty (e.g., depression, anxiety), and other factors. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists
    *   **Open Path Collective:**  Offers affordable therapy options (typically $30-$80 per session) for those who are uninsured or underinsured. https://openpathcollective.org/
    *   **Your Insurance Provider:**  Call the number on your insurance card to get a list of in-network mental health providers.
    *   **Employee Assistance Program (EAP):** If you're employed, check if your company offers an EAP.  These programs often provide free, short-term counseling services.
    *   **University Counseling Centers:** If you're a student, your university likely has a counseling center that offers free or low-cost services.
*   **Psychiatrist:**  A medical doctor who can prescribe medication for depression, if needed.  Often works in conjunction with a therapist.



**4.  Friends and Family (Support System):**

*   **Trusted Friends:**  Talk to someone you trust and feel comfortable with.  You don't have to go into great detail if you don't want to, but letting someone know you're struggling can be a huge relief.
*   **Family Members:**  If you have supportive family members, consider reaching out to them.
*   **Be Specific:**  Instead of just saying ""I'm sad,"" try saying ""I'm really struggling with my depression and could use someone to listen.""  It helps them understand how"
"I was raped a couple months ago, Since then, along with other unfortunately events that have occurred, I have been having trouble feeling emotions. It's almost as if I'm a sociopath lacking any feeling. What can I do to change this?","You are describing a very legitimate reaction to trauma.  Rape is an aweful experience and I am very sorry that happened to you.  When horrible things happen, people often react in a way that interferes with the ability to live a normal life and function the way they did in the past.  This is very common and the goal is to help you manage the stress caused by dealing with negative events and with help you can regain emotional well-being.  This is especially important if you have had more than one negative thing happen.  Oftentimes, the unconscious reaction is to become numb and avoid all feelings, especially if more than one negative event occurred.  A big part of what causes people trouble are feelings of guilt.  We often blame ourselves when bad things happen. It is actually difficult to comprehend the concept that we don't always have control of what happens in life.  In addition, when you mentioned feeling like a sociopath, it sounded like you feel like your reaction is wrong.  The first thing you can do is realize that your feelings and reactions are o.k., you aren't doing anything wrong, and nothing is wrong with you.  The next step is to start dealing with the impact of these traumatic experiences. Identifying your feelings, and knowing the thoughts and beliefs that are behind those emotions can help you regain your sense of happiness.  Research shows that understanding and expressing those thoughts and feelings can help.  If doesn't sound like you need to do anything to change yourself, but talking to a counselor can be helpful in managing your reaction to a incredibly traumatic experience.  I hope this helps you understand your feelings and can get to a place where you enjoy life.","Okay, this is a really important and incredibly brave question to ask.  It's completely understandable that you're experiencing emotional numbness after such a traumatic event as rape, compounded by other difficult circumstances.  It's *not* uncommon, and it doesn't mean you *are* a sociopath.  In fact, it's a very common response to trauma.  Let's break down what's happening and, more importantly, what you can do.  I'm going to give a detailed response, and then *very importantly* list resources at the end.  Please read those.

**Understanding What's Happening**

What you're describing sounds a lot like **emotional numbing**, a key symptom of **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)** or **complex trauma** (often resulting from ongoing or multiple traumas).  Here's *why* this happens:

* **Overwhelm:** Your brain, when faced with something as horrific as rape, can go into survival mode.  To protect you from being completely overwhelmed by the intensity of the pain, fear, and horror, it essentially ""shuts down"" emotional processing.  It's a defense mechanism.
* **Dissociation:**  Numbing is often linked to dissociation – feeling detached from your body, your emotions, or reality itself.  This can happen during the trauma itself, or as a way to cope with the aftermath.  It's like your mind created distance to survive.
* **Neurobiological Changes:** Trauma literally changes the brain.  Areas involved in emotional regulation (like the amygdala and prefrontal cortex) can be affected, making it harder to access and process feelings.
* **Depression & Anxiety:** Trauma often co-occurs with depression and anxiety, both of which can manifest as emotional flatness or a sense of emptiness.
* **Grief:**  Even if you didn't have a close relationship with the perpetrator, you are grieving the loss of safety, trust, control, and your former self.  Grief can be incredibly complex and sometimes present as numbness.
* **Other Events:** The ""other unfortunately events"" you mention will compound this. Each additional stressor adds to the overall burden and can reinforce the numbing.



**Why it *doesn't* mean you're a sociopath:**  Sociopathy (more accurately called Antisocial Personality Disorder) is a complex personality disorder characterized by a *long-standing* pattern of disregard for others, manipulation, and lack of empathy *before* any traumatic event.  Your emotional state is a *reaction to trauma*, not a pre-existing personality trait.  The fact that you *are* concerned about this and *want* to feel again is evidence against that.  Sociopaths generally don't experience distress about their lack of empathy.



**What You Can Do To Start Feeling Again**

This is a journey, and it will take time and effort.  There's no quick fix, but here's a breakdown of things you can try. *Please be patient with yourself.*

1. **Prioritize Safety & Self-Care (Foundation):**
   * **Physical Safety:** Ensure you are in a physically safe environment.  This is paramount.
   * **Basic Needs:** Focus on the basics: sleep, nutrition, hydration. Trauma can disrupt these, but they are crucial for healing.
   * **Boundaries:**  Learn to set and enforce healthy boundaries.  This is about protecting your energy and well-being.

2. **Seek Professional Help (Essential):**  This is *the most important step*.
   * **Trauma-Informed Therapist:**  Find a therapist specifically trained in trauma therapy.  Look for modalities like:
      * **EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing):**  Highly effective for processing traumatic memories.
      * **Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT):** Helps to identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors related to the trauma.
      * **Somatic Experiencing:**  Focuses on releasing trauma stored in the body.
      * **Internal Family Systems (IFS):** Helps to understand and heal different ""parts"" of yourself that were impacted by the trauma.
   * **Psychiatrist:**  If you are also experiencing depression or anxiety, a psychiatrist can evaluate if medication might be helpful *in conjunction with* therapy. (Medication isn’t always needed, but can be a useful tool.)

3. **Gentle Emotional Re-engagement (Start Small):**  Don't try to force feelings.  Start with small, manageable things.
   * **Mindfulness & Grounding:** Practices like deep breathing, meditation, and grounding exercises (e.g., focusing on your senses – what you see, hear, smell, touch) can help you reconnect with your body and present moment."
"How do you know you have the right therapist for you?
 How would I know how to ""train"" my therapist to be able to give me what I need from treatment?",If you connect with your therapist and can say whatever you want to say and not be judged.,"## How to Know You Have the Right Therapist

Finding the right therapist is a really important, and sometimes lengthy, process! It's not about finding someone ""perfect,"" but finding someone who's a *good fit* for *you*. Here's a breakdown of what to look for:

**Early Signs (First Few Sessions - ""The Assessment Phase""):**

* **You feel safe and comfortable:** This is HUGE. Do you feel like you can be vulnerable and open with them without fear of judgment? This doesn't mean you have to spill your life story in the first session, but do you sense a non-judgmental, accepting presence?
* **You feel heard and understood:**  Do they actively listen?  Do they reflect back what you say in a way that feels accurate and validating?  Are they making an effort to understand *your* perspective, even if they don’t agree with it?
* **They explain their approach:** They should clearly articulate their therapeutic style (e.g., CBT, psychodynamic, humanistic) and how it applies to your concerns. You should understand *how* they think therapy will work for *you*.
* **They ask you questions...lots of them:** A good therapist won't just *tell* you things, they'll *ask* you questions to get to know you, your history, your goals, and what's bringing you to therapy.
* **They’re collaborative:** It should feel like a partnership, not a one-way street. They should be inviting your input and working *with* you, not *on* you.
* **They're ethical and professional:** They should discuss confidentiality, boundaries, fees, and their cancellation policy upfront.

**Ongoing Signs (As Therapy Progresses):**

* **You feel challenged in a *helpful* way:**  Therapy isn’t just about feeling good. It’s about growth, and growth often involves discomfort. A good therapist will challenge your thought patterns and behaviors, but in a supportive and encouraging way.
* **You see progress (even small steps):** It's not always linear, but over time you should notice some positive changes in your thoughts, feelings, or behaviors.
* **You feel empowered:**  Therapy should help you develop coping skills, self-awareness, and a sense of agency over your life.
* **You generally look forward to sessions (or at least don't dread them):**  While therapy can be hard work, you shouldn't consistently feel anxious or worse *after* sessions.
* **You trust their expertise:** You don’t need to agree with everything they say, but you should trust their professional judgment.



**Red Flags (Dealbreakers):**

* **Judgmental or dismissive behavior:**  Any sign of disrespect or invalidation.
* **Giving unsolicited advice:**  Therapy is about helping *you* find your own answers, not being told what to do.
* **Breaching confidentiality:**  Unless legally required, your sessions are private.
* **Dual relationships:**  The therapist should *not* be a friend, romantic partner, or business associate.
* **Consistently missing the mark:** If they repeatedly misunderstand you or don't seem to grasp your concerns.
* **Making you feel worse consistently:** While temporary discomfort is normal, a consistently negative experience is a sign something isn't right.



## ""Training"" Your Therapist: How to Get What You Need

You're absolutely right to think about ""training"" your therapist! It's not about them being incompetent, it's about *you* being a proactive client and ensuring your needs are met. Here's how:

**1. Be Clear About Your Goals:**

* **At the beginning:** Clearly articulate what you want to get out of therapy.  ""I want to manage my anxiety better,"" is a good start. “I want to understand why I keep repeating unhealthy relationship patterns” is even better. 
* **Revisit them regularly:**  Don't assume your therapist remembers your initial goals.  Periodically say, ""I'm still working towards X.  Are we on track?""

**2. Provide Feedback – Constantly:**

* **During Sessions:**
    * **""That didn't quite land for me.""** If something they say feels unhelpful or misses the point.
    * **""Could you explain that a little differently?""** If you don’t understand their explanation.
    * **""I'm feeling uncomfortable talking about this right now. Can we slow down?""**  Setting boundaries is crucial.
    * **""When you say X, it makes me feel Y.""**  This is direct and helpful feedback.
* **At the End of Sessions:**
    * **""What did you think of today's session?""**  Invite their perspective"
"I am not sure if I am depressed. I don't know how to bring it up to my parents, and that makes me miserable.","Depending on your relationship with your parents, inviting them to have a conversation might be a good first step.  If they consent then you can have the opportunity to discuss your concerns with them.  Inviting someone to a conversation and getting their agreement is a great first step. I would then make sure your location of the discussion is conducive to the conversation and once all that is considered it might be beneficial that you make a list of your concerns prior to the meeting.  this can help keep you on point. ","Okay, that's a really tough spot to be in. It's completely understandable why you're feeling miserable - feeling unsure about your mental health *and* being scared to talk to your parents about it is a lot to carry. You're already doing a good thing by acknowledging how you feel and reaching out, even if it's just to this space. Let's break this down, and I'll try to offer some support and ideas.  I'm an AI and can't diagnose you, but I can help you think through this.

**1. Validating Your Feelings:**

*   **It's okay to not be sure.** Depression doesn't always look like extreme sadness. It can manifest as fatigue, irritability, loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, changes in sleep or appetite, difficulty concentrating, and feeling generally ""off.""  The fact that you're questioning it means something isn't right, and that's worth exploring.
*   **It's okay to be scared to talk to your parents.** There are *so* many reasons why this might be difficult. Maybe they're not emotionally available, maybe they dismiss feelings, maybe you're worried about disappointing them, or maybe you just don't know how they'll react.  Those fears are valid.
*   **It's okay to feel miserable.**  Bottling things up *will* make you feel worse. You're right to recognize that.



**2. Figuring Out *How* You Feel (A Little Self-Reflection):**

Before you talk to your parents, it might help to get a little clearer on what you're experiencing.  This isn't about self-diagnosing, but about gathering information for yourself and potentially for a professional.  Consider these questions (you don't have to answer them all at once, and you don't have to share them with me if you don't want to):

*   **How long have you been feeling this way?** Is it a recent thing, or has it been going on for weeks or months?
*   **What specifically is making you feel miserable?**  Is it a general sense of emptiness, or are there specific triggers?
*   **Have you noticed any changes in your daily life?**  (Sleep, appetite, energy levels, social interaction, school/work performance, hobbies)
*   **Are you having any thoughts of harming yourself?**  (If yes, please see the ""Important - If You're in Crisis"" section at the end.)
*   **What things *used* to bring you joy that don't anymore?**
*   **Are you feeling hopeless about the future?**
*   **Do you feel anxious or worried a lot of the time?**
*   **Are you easily irritated or frustrated?**

You can even try journaling, or just making a list of things that are bothering you.  Sometimes writing it down helps clarify things.

**3.  Strategies for Talking to Your Parents:**

This is the hardest part. Here's a range of approaches, from less direct to more direct.  Choose what feels safest and most comfortable for *you*.

*   **Start Small:**  You don't have to say ""I think I'm depressed"" right away.  You could start by saying, ""I've been feeling really down lately,"" or ""I've been struggling with my mood.""
*   **""I"" Statements:** Focus on how *you* are feeling, rather than blaming anyone.  For example, instead of ""You guys never listen to me,"" try ""I feel like it's hard for me to talk to you about things.""
*   **Pick the Right Time & Place:** Don't try to have this conversation when they're stressed, busy, or distracted.  Choose a quiet, private time when you can all talk without interruption.
*   **Write a Letter or Email:**  If you find it too difficult to talk face-to-face, writing a letter or email can be a good option.  It gives you time to organize your thoughts and allows them to process the information before responding.  (You can even *read* the letter to them if that feels better).
*   **Bring Information:**  Sometimes, presenting information about depression can help. You could find a website (like the ones I'll list below) and share articles with them. This can help them understand what you're going through.
*   **Enlist Support:**  Is there another trusted adult you can talk to first – a teacher, counselor, aunt/uncle, or friend's parent?  They might be able to offer advice or even help you talk to your parents.
*   **Focus on Functioning:**  Instead of saying ""I'm sad"
"People have been calling me names, and I have had enough of it. I cannot stand it anymore I'm done. I have told someone this, and that is why I am writing this. The thoughts are awful.","It's sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed with intrusive thoughts and are feeling very criticized by others as well. I think it is great that you are reaching out and I can tell that you want this to change. Working with a competent therapist may be a good option for getting some more clarity about what is going on, developing ways to cope, and eventually getting relief from these overwhelming experiences.","Okay, it takes a lot of courage to reach out and admit you're struggling, and I want you to know I'm here to listen. It sounds like you're in a really painful situation, being called names and feeling overwhelmed by awful thoughts.  It's completely understandable that you've had enough and that you're feeling ""done.""  The fact that you told someone is a *very* important step – that shows strength, even though it might not feel like it right now.

I'm really glad you're writing this down, getting it out of your head. That's a healthy thing to do.

Here's a breakdown of how we can approach this, and importantly, resources that can help *right now*.  I'll cover a few things, then list resources at the end.  Please read through it all, even if it feels hard.

**1. Validate Your Feelings:**

* **You are not okay, and that's okay.** It's *not* weak to be deeply affected by being called names. Words can be incredibly hurtful, and persistent negativity is damaging.
* **Your feelings are valid.**  Anger, sadness, frustration, despair – all of these are natural responses to being treated poorly.
* **You deserve respect.**  No one deserves to be subjected to name-calling and abuse.

**2. Understanding What's Happening:**

* **The impact of words:**  Being repeatedly called names can erode your self-esteem, make you question your worth, and lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts.  It's a form of emotional abuse.
* **Awful thoughts are a *symptom*, not a reflection of you.** When you're under this kind of stress, it's common to have negative thought patterns.  These thoughts are the result of the abuse, not inherent truths about you.  They can feel very real, but they are often distorted.
* **You've reached a breaking point.** Saying you're ""done"" suggests you've been coping with this for a while, and you've reached the limit of what you can handle.  That's a really important signal that something needs to change.

**3. What You Can Do (Right Now & Longer Term):**

* **Safety First:**  If you are having thoughts of harming yourself, *please* reach out for immediate help.  I'll list crisis resources below.  This is the most important thing.
* **Distance Yourself (If Possible):**  If you can, create distance between yourself and the person/people who are calling you names. This might mean limiting contact, blocking them on social media, or avoiding certain situations.
* **Lean on Your Support System:** You've already taken a good step by telling someone. Talk to them more.  Talk to trusted friends, family members, teachers, counselors, or anyone you feel safe with.  Don't isolate yourself.
* **Practice Self-Care:**  This might sound difficult when you're feeling down, but try to do things that bring you even a small amount of comfort or joy.  This could be:
    * **Gentle exercise:**  A walk, stretching, or yoga.
    * **Relaxation techniques:** Deep breathing, meditation, or listening to calming music.
    * **Spending time in nature:**  If possible.
    * **Engaging in a hobby:** Something you enjoy, even if you don't feel motivated.
    * **Getting enough sleep:**  Even if it's just a little bit more than usual.
    * **Eating nourishing food:**  Even small, healthy meals can help.
* **Challenge Negative Thoughts:** When you have a negative thought, try to question it.  Is it based on facts, or is it just a feeling?  Would you say that to a friend?  Are there alternative ways to look at the situation? (This is something a therapist can help you with.)
* **Consider Professional Help:**  A therapist can provide a safe space for you to process your feelings, develop coping mechanisms, and build your self-esteem.  They can also help you address any underlying issues that may be contributing to your distress.

"I've been with a man for four years. For the last year, he has said he is done, but he still talks, texts, visits, and has not moved on with anyone else. His words do not match his actions. I love this man, but it's hurting so much.","This can be difficult and confusing.If you think your boyfriend would be open to having a discussion, try asking him for a time when he is willing to have an important discussion. When that time matches with a time that is good for you, try discussing the type of relationship that you each want to have and what you can start and stop doing to get there. He may want to be really good friends. He may also be trying to figure out what he is feeling. If you end up talking over one another, try letting one person be the one who is talking about their feelings for about five minutes and during that time, try having the other person asked questions to gain more understanding of their experience. Then you can switch. Also consider asking questions that cannot be answered with yes or no, but lead to more explanations.Questions that start with the words how, what, when, who are usually better than questions starting with ""why"" because they can be emotional triggers for some people.If this is difficult to do between the two of you, consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couples.","Okay, this is *incredibly* common and *incredibly* painful. You're right to feel hurt. You're in a really tough spot, caught between what he *says* and what he *does*, and it's completely valid that it's causing you so much distress. Here's a breakdown of what's likely happening, why it's so damaging, and what you can do to protect yourself.  I'll try to be thorough.

**Understanding What's Happening (The Disconnect)**

* **Mixed Messages:** This is the core problem. He's giving you a very confusing and ultimately unkind message. Saying ""I'm done"" while continuing to engage is a form of emotional manipulation, even if he's not consciously trying to manipulate you.
* **Possible Reasons for His Behavior (Not Excuses, but Possibilities):**
    * **Fear of Loneliness:** He might be afraid of being alone and uses you as a comfort, even if he's convinced himself he doesn't want a relationship.
    * **Control:**  Keeping you ""on the hook"" gives him a sense of control. He gets attention and validation without the commitment he's unwilling to give.
    * **Avoidance of Difficult Conversations:**  Actually breaking things off completely, and dealing with your reaction, is harder than vaguely stating he's ""done.""
    * **Unresolved Feelings:** He *might* still have feelings for you, but be struggling with something (commitment issues, fear of vulnerability, etc.) that prevents him from fully embracing a relationship.  However, even *if* this is true, his behavior is still unacceptable.
    * **He Doesn't Know What He Wants:** Some people genuinely struggle with knowing what they want, and they bounce back and forth, creating chaos for everyone involved.
* **Why It's So Damaging:**
    * **Emotional Exhaustion:**  Constantly trying to decipher his actions and reconcile them with his words is draining. You're living in a state of uncertainty.
    * **Prevents Closure:** His inconsistent behavior prevents *you* from moving on.  You're stuck in limbo, hoping for something that may never come.
    * **Erosion of Self-Worth:**  Being treated this way can make you question your value and wonder what you're doing wrong.  You start to doubt your instincts.
    * **False Hope:**  The continued contact keeps a tiny flicker of hope alive, making it even harder to detach and heal.



**What You Need to Do (Focus on *You*)**

This is about taking control of your own emotional well-being.  It won't be easy, and it might feel counterintuitive, but it's essential.

1. **Acknowledge Your Pain:**  Don't minimize how much this is hurting you.  Allow yourself to feel the sadness, frustration, and anger.  Journaling, talking to a trusted friend or therapist, or engaging in self-care activities can help.

2. **Stop Seeking Explanation:**  You've likely spent a lot of time trying to understand *why* he's doing this. Stop.  His reasons are his responsibility.  You're unlikely to get a satisfying answer, and continuing to ask will only prolong your pain.  The ""why"" doesn't change the *what* – he's behaving in a way that is harmful to you.

3. **Set Firm Boundaries – And *Enforce* Them:** This is the hardest part, but the most crucial.  You need to decide what you will and will not accept.  Here are some options, ranging from less to more drastic:

    * **Limit Contact:** Start by reducing the frequency of texts, calls, and visits.  Don't initiate contact. Respond only when necessary and keep responses brief.
    * **""Grey Rock"" Method:**  When you *do* have to interact, be emotionally neutral.  Answer questions factually and avoid engaging in personal discussions.  Become uninteresting to him.
    * **Direct Communication (One Last Time):**  You could have one final conversation (if you feel safe and up to it) where you state clearly: ""I understand you've said you're done, but your actions tell a different story.  This mixed messaging is deeply hurtful to me, and I need to protect myself.  I need space to move on, and I will be [reducing contact/taking a break/ending contact completely].""  *Don't* get drawn into a debate.  State your boundaries and end the conversation.
    * **No Contact:** This is often the most effective, though the most difficult.  This means blocking his number, unfollowing him on social media, and avoiding places where you might run into him.  It allows you the"
"I'm applying to private high schools. I'm playing basketball on my school team currently, and I love it. I also play on a team that I've hated since the beginning, and I finally want to quit before the season gets started. However, my parents say I can play on either both teams or neither. I think it's unfair because it's up to me if I want to play for a certain team. I was planning on playing basketball for the high school I get into, but if that means continuing to play for the team I hate, then I wouldn't want to play in high school. Now I don't know what to do! My parents are threatening to send me off to a different home if I don't play. I just want to run away.","The situation in your family seems to place unnecessary pressure on you.Are you and your parents able to talk together about their reason for their standard?Are your parents willing to listen to your reasons to not play on the team you hate?If yes, then maybe some type of compromise is possible for all of you to negotiate.If none of the above is possible, then you may want to get specific and direct advice from a professional, such as the school guidance counselor or psychologist, whom you'd trust and feel safe in talking.I hope you and your parents will find an answer that all of you are happy to accept.","Okay, this is a *really* tough situation, and it's completely understandable why you're feeling overwhelmed and wanting to run away. It sounds like a lot of pressure is being piled onto you, and it's impacting something you genuinely love. Let's break this down, and then talk about resources to help you.  This is a multi-layered problem, and we'll address it that way.

**1. Understanding the Core Issues**

* **Control & Autonomy:** You feel like your parents are taking away your agency. You deserve to have a say in how you spend your time and what activities you participate in, especially when it comes to something you're passionate about.  Their ""both or nothing"" rule feels controlling.
* **Enjoyment vs. Obligation:** Basketball is something you *love*, but this specific team is making it a negative experience. Forcing you to continue with a team you hate taints the entire sport for you.
* **High School Implications:**  The connection between playing *this* team and your desire to play in *high school* is a really important one.  Your parents are essentially holding your future enjoyment hostage.
* **Threats & Emotional Manipulation:**  Threatening to send you to another home is a seriously concerning reaction.  That's not a way to guide or support a child. It's a form of emotional manipulation and can be incredibly damaging.
* **Overwhelm & Hopelessness:**  It's no surprise you want to run away.  When you feel trapped and unheard, that's a natural reaction.  But running away won't solve the underlying issues.



**2.  Addressing the Immediate Situation - Your Parents**

This is the hardest part.  Here's how to *try* to communicate, understanding that it might not go well.  Remember, your safety and emotional wellbeing are the most important things.

* **Choose a Calm Time:**  Don't try to have this conversation in the heat of the moment.  Find a time when everyone is relatively calm.
* **""I Feel"" Statements:**  Focus on how *you* feel, not on blaming them.  For example:
    *  Instead of: ""You're being unfair and ruining basketball for me!""
    *  Try: ""I feel really stressed and anxious when I think about playing on that team. I feel like my feelings aren't being considered.""
    *  Instead of: ""You're threatening me!""
    *  Try:  ""I feel scared and unsafe when I hear I might be sent to live somewhere else if I don't do what you want.""
* **Explain the Bigger Picture:**  ""Basketball is something I really enjoy, and I was excited to play in high school. But if playing for [the hated team] is a condition of that, it makes me not want to play at all.  I'm worried I'll lose my love for the game.""
* **Focus on Your Wellbeing:**  ""I need to be able to make decisions about my own activities, especially when those activities are causing me stress and unhappiness.  I need to feel like my feelings matter.""
* **Ask for Understanding:**  ""Can we please talk about this and try to find a compromise?  I just want to be happy and enjoy things.""
* **Don't Get Drawn Into Arguments:**  If they become angry or dismissive, try to stay calm and repeat your ""I feel"" statements. If the conversation escalates, it's okay to say, ""I need to take a break and come back to this later.""

**However…** be prepared that they might not respond well.  If they continue to be controlling, dismissive, or threatening, you need to move to step 3.



**3.  Seeking Help – This is CRUCIAL.  Do NOT handle this alone.**

Your parents' behavior, especially the threats, is not okay. You need to talk to a trusted adult.  Here are some options:

* **School Counselor:**  Your school counselor is a great resource. They can offer support, help you communicate with your parents, and potentially mediate a conversation.
* **Another Relative:**  Is there an aunt, uncle, grandparent, or other family member you trust who might be able to intervene or offer support?
* **Teacher:**  A teacher you trust and feel comfortable with can be a good sounding board and may be able to offer guidance.
* **Youth Hotline/Crisis Line:**  These are available 24/7 and offer confidential support. They can help you process your feelings and explore options.  Here are a few:

"Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes  I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I can't get it out.  How can I stop these thoughts?","Hi there,I first want to let you know that having these thoughts is completely normal. Studies have been done that show that 80% of human thoughts are ""negative"" so you are not alone. I like to think of thoughts as a tornado... if you are in a tornado, you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial. However, when you are, let's say, a mile away from a tornado, it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as get shelter or make sure your family and friends are safe. When unhelpful or scary thoughts arise, we tend to start a ""war"" with them, which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado. This makes the thoughts and emotions bigger and intensifies the feelings that go with them. So the question I imagine you have is ""how do I get out of the tornado?"" There are 3 steps to doing this:Get distance from your thoughts by adding ""I am noticing I'm having the thought that...."" to the front of them. For example, ""I am noticing I am having the thought that something bad is going to happen to me.""   The purpose of this is not to decrease your fear or get rid of the thought. These thoughts might always be there and that is okay because that is how the mind naturally works so struggling with that is a waste of time and energy. The purpose is to gain some distance from the thoughts so you don't get swept away by them. You can imagine them floating along like leaves in a stream or clouds in the sky (and often the same thought will come back again and again but that's okay... just continue to notice it with curiosity). I imagine the thoughts get in your way of doing what really matters to you so if you can get a little bit of distance, you can do things that are fulfilling and meaningful to you. Tune into your body and notice what sensations come up and where you feel them most intensely. Then breathe into them and make room for them. Our 5 main emotions are: joy, sadness, fear/anxiety, shame, and anger. ALL of these emotions are part of being human and there is no escaping them. So again, struggling with them ends up intensifying them. Instead, let them be and make a little bit of room for them. Often a side effect of this is the intensity will decrease but it might not. The purpose is to keep them from becoming more intense. Contact the present moment. Notice what is happening here and now. One way of doing this is tuning into the five senses. What are some things you hear, see, taste, smell, and feel? Another way is to notice what is happening in your body (without trying to change it). How deep are your breaths, what is happening with your heart rate, are you cold/warm, etc?Implementing these three steps can help you to refrain from getting caught up in your unhelpful thoughts. Unfortunately there is no way to get rid of thoughts or feelings completely. So the only option that works in the long run is to accept them while continuing to do what matters to you and what is fulfilling to you.I hope this helps!","Okay, this is really common, and it's good you're reaching out and wanting to address it. It sounds like you're experiencing what's often called ""intrusive thoughts"" - unwanted, often distressing thoughts that pop into your head and feel hard to control.  Here's a breakdown of how to understand them, and a lot of strategies to help you stop them, ranging from things you can do *in the moment* to longer-term practices.  I'll also include when it's important to seek professional help.  This is a long response, because it's a complex issue, but I want to be thorough.

**1. Understanding What's Happening: It's Not About *Wanting* the Thought**

* **Intrusive Thoughts are Normal:**  Seriously.  Everyone experiences unwanted thoughts sometimes.  The difference is how much distress they cause and how much they interfere with your life.  Having a scary thought doesn't mean you *want* bad things to happen, or that you're a bad person.  It just means your brain is doing a thing it sometimes does.
* **The Anxiety Loop:** You've already identified a key part: the thought gets stuck.  This happens because anxiety feeds itself. You have a scary thought, you get anxious *about* the thought, and that anxiety makes you focus *more* on the thought, which increases the anxiety, and so on. It's a vicious cycle.
* **Your Brain's ""Smoke Detector"":**  Think of your brain as having a smoke detector.  It's supposed to alert you to danger.  Sometimes, it gets overly sensitive and goes off when there's no fire (the scary thought).  Your reaction to the smoke (the anxiety) makes the alarm even louder.
* **Not Predictive:**  Just because you *think* something bad might happen, doesn't mean it *will* happen.  Our thoughts are not facts.  Intrusive thoughts often focus on improbable or unrealistic scenarios.



**2. In-the-Moment Techniques (When a Thought Strikes)**

These are things you can try *as* you're experiencing the scary thought:

* **Label It:**  Say to yourself, ""I'm having an intrusive thought."" Just labeling it can create some distance.  You're observing the thought, rather than *being* the thought.  You can even add, ""This is just anxiety.""
* **Don't Engage, Don't Suppress:** This is tricky, but crucial.
    * **Don't Engage:**  Don't try to analyze the thought, figure out why you're having it, or argue with it.  Don't mentally check things to reassure yourself.  (e.g., if you have a thought about leaving the stove on, *don't* go back and check it, even if you're not sure. That reinforces the cycle.)
    * **Don't Suppress:**  Trying to *force* the thought away often backfires. It's like telling someone not to think of a pink elephant – you've just made them think of a pink elephant!
* **Thought Defusion:** Techniques to create distance from the thought:
    * **""I'm noticing I'm having the thought that...""** (e.g., ""I'm noticing I'm having the thought that I'm going to get sick."") This creates separation.
    * **Repeat the thought in a silly voice:**  This can sound ridiculous, lessening its power.
    * **Imagine the thought as a leaf floating down a stream:**  Just observe it passing by, without getting carried away with it.
* **Grounding Techniques:** Bring yourself back to the present moment.  These are great for anxiety in general:
    * **5-4-3-2-1:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Deep Breathing:**  Slow, deep breaths (box breathing: inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4) can calm your nervous system.
    * **Physical Sensations:**  Focus on the feeling of your feet on the ground, your hands in your lap, or the texture of your clothing.
* **Acceptance (Radical Acceptance):**  This is a core principle in therapies like Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).  It doesn't mean you *like* the thought, but you accept that it's *there*.  Resisting it makes it stronger.  Think, ""Okay, I'm having this thought. It's unpleasant, but I can handle it.""

"I started dating my fiancé two years ago. My first cousin is married to my fiancé’s sister. There has always been a communication issue between my uncle and aunt and my cousin and his wife. My uncle goes to my mom instead of talking to my cousin, and it upsets my mom.","Based on the information provided, this is an issue with boundaries.   Sounds like your uncle goes to your mom and possibly your mother takes the issues to you.  I do not like to assume so I will direct you to information regarding families dealing with enmeshment and triangulation.  Enmeshment is the concept of diffused boundaries in families and other personal relationships.  Triangulation is two individuals relaying information to a third party what cannot be said directly to each other.  From someone who has dealt with both these issues on a personal level, being informed about family dynamics is beneficial and can help you develop healthy boundaries for yourself within your family structure.  You may need assistance with developing healthy boundaries.  Although it is possible, it is not easy to change the way you have been operating for any extended amount of time.  Hope this help!","Okay, this is a complex family situation! It's good you're recognizing the dynamic and thinking about how it might impact things, especially with an upcoming marriage. Let's break down the issues and think about how to navigate this. Here's a detailed look, covering the core problems, potential impacts, and how you and your fiancé can approach this.

**Understanding the Core Issues**

* **Dysfunctional Communication Pattern:** The core problem is a long-standing pattern of indirect communication. Your uncle avoids direct conflict with your cousin by going *through* your mom. This is unhealthy and creates a lot of unnecessary stress and triangulation.
* **Burden on Your Mom:** Your mom is being put in a really unfair position. She's caught in the middle, forced to be a messenger or mediator, and likely feels emotionally drained and frustrated.
* **Underlying Conflict:**  The fact that your uncle *avoids* your cousin suggests there's an underlying conflict that hasn't been addressed. It could be anything – personality clashes, disagreements about family matters, perceived slights, etc.  The *content* of the conflict isn’t as important right now as the *pattern* of avoiding it.
* **Potential for Spillover:**  This existing family dynamic *will* impact your and your fiancé's relationship, even if unintentionally. It creates a layer of tension and potential awkwardness.
* **The Cousin's Marriage:** Your cousin's marriage is also affected by this. It’s likely straining their relationship as well if family communication is so indirect.



**How This Impacts You and Your Fiancé**

* **Holiday/Family Event Stress:** Gatherings could become minefields. You might feel pressured to take sides (even just by being present), or witness uncomfortable interactions.
* **Loyalty Conflicts:** You could feel pulled between your family and your fiancé's family.  You love both, and want everyone to get along, but that may not be realistic.
* **Strain on Your Relationship:** Constant background tension about family dynamics is exhausting. It can erode your energy and potentially lead to arguments or distance between you and your fiancé.
* **Future In-Law Relationships:** The existing dynamic could make it harder to build a healthy relationship with your future in-laws.
* **Potential for Interference:** While hopefully not, the pattern of indirect communication could extend to issues within *your* marriage down the line.



**What You and Your Fiancé Can Do (A Collaborative Approach is Key!)**

This needs to be a team effort. You and your fiancé need to be on the same page.  Here's a breakdown of strategies, divided into short-term (before/around the wedding) and long-term (post-wedding).

**1. Short-Term: Wedding Focused (Minimize Drama)**

* **Limit Information Sharing:** This is crucial.  *Neither* of you should be relaying information between your uncle/aunt and your cousin/wife.  Politely but firmly refuse to be a messenger.  Example: ""Oh, I haven't spoken to Uncle [Name] about that. You might want to reach out to him directly.""
* **Strategic Seating:** At the wedding and other events, think carefully about seating arrangements to minimize potential for awkwardness. Don’t put people who have issues directly next to each other.
* **Pre-emptive Conversations:** You and your fiancé should talk to your respective families individually *before* the wedding.  The message: ""We are so excited about getting married. We want the wedding to be a joyful and peaceful occasion. We would really appreciate it if everyone could focus on celebrating with us and put any existing issues aside for the day.""  Keep it brief and focused on the wedding.
* **Have an ""Exit Strategy"":**  If things *do* get tense at the wedding, have a plan for how you'll politely excuse yourselves from the situation.  A pre-arranged signal between you and your fiancé can be helpful.
* **Enlist Allies:** Is there another family member (a grandparent, a more level-headed aunt/uncle) who can subtly help diffuse tension if needed?

**2. Long-Term: Building Healthy Boundaries (The More Important Work)**

* **United Front:** You and your fiancé *must* present a united front.  Agree on how you'll handle family issues and support each other.
* **Direct Communication (for *You and Your Fiancé*):** Talk openly with each other about how the family dynamics make you feel. Don't let resentment build.  Regular check-ins are important.
* **Boundaries with Your Uncle:**  This is likely the hardest part. You (and possibly your mom, if she's willing) need to gently but firmly set boundaries with your uncle.
    * **""Uncle, I love you, but I'm not comfortable"
"In 2008 my former husband of 14 years walked away from my life and we've been separated ever since. We have always been together sexually and both have experienced sleeping with others. I stopped because I wanted my marriage to work out but he did not. If he stops sleeping with other women, can our marriage be saved? Or should we just part ways? I still care deeply about him after all that I did and he has done. But he is seeing someone else on and off for years now. Will our marriage still be saved if he decides that he wants to try to do so?","Sorry to hear about the stress in your relationship.  There is definite value in being clear as you are, about your own emotional investment in your husband and that you expect sexual exclusivity from him as part of the foundation of your marriage.Also positive is your awareness that only your husband is the one who must similarly decide his own standards of being sexually exclusive to you, or not.Whether your marriage can be saved depends on what each person is willing to accept about the other one.Is sleeping with other women the only criterion of what will satisfy you about being together with your husband?Love and care are not enough to make a marriage work. Partners need to be able to compromise and cooperate with each other. That you care for him definitely intensifies any emotion you feel toward your husband.  It intensifies any frustration and sadness about the relationship too.Decide how much emotional sadness and hurt you're willing to tolerate and the reason you're willing to do so.From what you write, you are being very generous of yourself and not being reciprocated for this.If your husband doesn't start taking steps toward satisfying your wishes, this may be your time to question your own generosity in waiting for him to do so.","Okay, this is a *very* complex situation with a lot of history. It's good you're asking these questions, as it shows you're trying to think through this thoughtfully. Here's a breakdown of the issues and a considered response, aiming to be realistic and supportive.  I'll cover the likelihood of saving the marriage, what needs to happen, and ultimately, whether it's a healthy path for *you*.  Please read the disclaimer at the end, as this is not a substitute for professional advice.

**Can Your Marriage Be Saved If He Stops Sleeping With Other Women?**

The simple answer is: **potentially, but not *because* he stops sleeping with others.**  That's a *necessary* condition, but not *sufficient*.  Stopping the outside relationships is step one, but a huge amount of work needs to follow. The core issues that led to the separation in the first place haven't been addressed in 16 years, and those are the things that really need focus.

Here's why just stopping the affairs doesn't fix things:

* **The Affairs Are a Symptom, Not the Disease:**  The affairs likely *stemmed* from deeper problems within the marriage – unmet needs (emotional, physical, intellectual), communication breakdown, resentment, loss of intimacy, differing values, or individual struggles.  Removing the symptom doesn't cure the disease.
* **Broken Trust:** 16 years of ongoing sexual activity outside the marriage has deeply eroded trust.  Even if he stops now, rebuilding that trust will be an *extremely* long and arduous process.  It requires consistent, transparent behavior over a significant period.
* **Your Unilateral Effort:** You stopped being intimate with others hoping to salvage the marriage, and he didn't reciprocate. That imbalance of effort is important to acknowledge.  It’s natural to feel resentment about that.
* **Years of Separation:**  You've both lived separate lives for a decade and a half. You've likely changed as individuals.  You need to rediscover who each of you *are* now, and whether those people are compatible.



**What Needs to Happen for There to Be *Any* Chance of Saving the Marriage?**

If both of you are genuinely willing to explore reconciliation, here's what *must* happen:

1. **Complete Transparency & Honesty:** He needs to be completely honest about the extent of his outside relationships, not just currently, but historically.  This is painful, but essential.  You need a full understanding of what's been happening.  (This might require him seeking support to be fully honest).
2. **Individual Therapy (for both of you):**  Each of you needs to understand *why* you made the choices you did. What needs were you trying to meet? What patterns of behavior contributed to the situation?  Individual therapy is crucial for self-awareness and personal growth.
3. **Couples Therapy (with a qualified therapist):**  This is non-negotiable. A skilled therapist can help you navigate the incredibly complex emotions, communication patterns, and underlying issues that led to the separation.  They can provide a safe space to explore difficult conversations and develop new skills.  Look for a therapist specializing in infidelity and marital recovery.
4. **Addressing the Root Causes:** Identify the original problems that drove him away and the reasons you stayed.  These need to be addressed head-on.  Were there communication issues?  Lack of emotional intimacy?  Unresolved conflicts?  Differing life goals?
5. **Rebuilding Trust (a long-term process):** This involves consistent honesty, reliability, empathy, and vulnerability. It means showing up for each other, keeping promises, and demonstrating a genuine commitment to the relationship.
6. **Redefining the Relationship:**  After 16 years, you can't simply go back to how things were. You need to create a *new* relationship based on mutual respect, understanding, and shared values. What will the boundaries be? What are your shared goals for the future?
7. **Forgiveness (a choice, not a feeling):** This is incredibly difficult, but essential.  Forgiveness doesn't excuse his actions, but it allows *you* to release the anger and resentment that are holding you back.  It's a process, and it may not be possible without significant therapy.
8. **Time & Patience:**  This will take *years*, not months.  There will be setbacks.  There will be pain.  You both need to be prepared for a long and challenging journey.



**Should You Just Part Ways?**

This is the hard question.  Here are some things to consider:

* **Your Well-being:** After 16 years of this dynamic, how has it affected your emotional and mental health? Are you constantly anxious, hurt,"
"I've been going through a rough time lately. I been into nothing but women. I’ve never thought about men until a week ago. I’m very upset and depressed about this. It's not normal to me. I looked at gay porn more than once to prove that I’m not gay. I get the same results each time, and I feel disgust. This is tough on me. I'm scared that I looked too many times. I keep thinking about it and shake all the time.","Are you able to give yourself some peace of mind while you take the time to further address whether or not you are gay?Whether or not and to what degree a person accepts their sexuality, depends on dense factors such as the culture of your family, the beliefs about gay people with which you were brought up, and your own tolerance for being a unique individual.Examining these factors, whether inwardly by yourself, in online blogs and sites, or live with other people, requires patience and effort.The more you are willing to commit to figuring out your own truth, the greater is your chance of finding it!","Okay, this sounds incredibly distressing, and it's brave of you to reach out and talk about it. It's understandable you're feeling upset, confused, and even scared right now. You're experiencing a lot of conflicting emotions, and it's important to address them with compassion and understanding, *especially* towards yourself.  Here's a breakdown of what you're describing, why it's happening, and what steps you can take to cope.  I'll try to be thorough, and I'll include resources at the end.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Sudden Attraction/Curiosity:** It's not uncommon for people to experience a shift in their attractions or to become aware of attractions they hadn't previously acknowledged.  Sexuality is often more fluid than we realize, and it can be influenced by a lot of factors - stress, emotional changes, even just exposure to new ideas.  The fact that this is *new* for you is what's throwing you off, and that's perfectly valid.
* **Internalized Homophobia:**  You mentioned it ""not being normal *to you*.""  This suggests you've grown up with certain beliefs about sexuality, likely that being attracted to men is wrong, undesirable, or incompatible with your identity. This is what we call internalized homophobia – negative feelings about same-sex attraction that you’ve absorbed from society or your upbringing.  This is *very* common, and it's a major source of the distress you're experiencing.
* **The Pornography Experiment:**  The fact that you used pornography to ""prove"" your sexuality is a strong indicator of your anxiety and the pressure you're putting on yourself.  Pornography is *not* a reliable way to determine your sexual orientation. It's a form of stimulation and doesn't necessarily reflect genuine attraction.  Furthermore, the disgust you felt afterward reinforces the conflict between your feelings and your beliefs.  It's actually pretty common for people to feel disconnected or even repulsed by porn, regardless of their orientation.
* **Obsessive Thinking and Anxiety:**  The shaking, the constant replaying of the experience, and the fear are all signs of anxiety, potentially bordering on obsessive thoughts. You're caught in a loop, trying to control something that doesn't necessarily need controlling.  The more you try *not* to think about it, the more it seems to consume you.
* **Depression:** The overall situation is understandably contributing to feelings of depression.  The internal conflict, the self-judgment, and the anxiety can all weigh heavily on your mental health.



**Why You're Likely Feeling This Way**

Let's break down some possibilities:

* **You are questioning your sexuality:**  This is a big one.  It’s okay to question!  Sexuality isn't always fixed and defined.  You may be realizing that you have attractions that are broader than you previously thought.
* **You're experiencing a temporary phase of curiosity:** Sometimes, people explore different avenues of attraction out of curiosity, and it doesn't necessarily mean a fundamental shift in orientation.
* **Stress and Emotional Vulnerability:**  When we're under stress, our emotional guard can come down, and we might become more open to exploring new feelings.
* **You're afraid of what others will think:**  This is a powerful fear.  The fear of judgment, rejection, or changing how people see you can be incredibly paralyzing.




**What You Can Do Now:  A Step-by-Step Approach**

1. **Self-Compassion:** This is the *most* important step.  Stop judging yourself.  You are not a bad person for having these thoughts or feelings.  You are human, and humans are complex.  Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend going through something similar.  Repeat phrases like, ""It's okay to feel confused,"" ""I'm doing the best I can,"" or ""These feelings don't define me.""

2. **Stop the ""Testing"":**  Immediately stop using pornography to ""figure things out."" It's not helping, and it's actually exacerbating your anxiety and distress.  It's reinforcing the negative cycle.

3. **Acknowledge Your Feelings (Without Judgment):**  Allow yourself to *feel* what you're feeling.  Don't try to suppress it.  Instead of saying, ""I shouldn't be thinking this,"" try, ""I'm having thoughts about men, and that's okay. It's just a thought.""  Labeling the emotions (""I'm feeling anxious,"" ""I'm feeling disgusted,"" ""I'm feeling scared"") can help to diffuse their power.

4. **Journaling:**  Write down your thoughts and"
I blame my past relationship for it. I know it is bad to be this way. I want to get past it.,"We humans are social beings. We learn how to BE in relationship as children. The caregiving you received (or didn't receive) set the stage for how you show up in all your adult relationships. Insecurity in relationships often has much to do with feeling unheard or unseen, perhaps feeling like you don't matter. There are many ways to rewire these relational patterns, the first step of which is taking pause and noticing that you are feeling insecure - so congrats on that because clearly you are already there!  Next I'd suggest finding a relationship therapist to help you sort through your insecurities, either as a couple or individually. ","Okay, it's really good that you recognize this and *want* to get past it. That's the biggest first step, and honestly, a really important one. It's completely understandable to be affected by a past relationship, especially if it was difficult.  It's *not* bad to feel the way you do – it's a natural human response to pain and trauma. Blaming it on the past relationship is also a natural starting point, but as you already know, staying stuck in that blame won't help you move forward.

Let's break this down.  You've said a lot with just a few sentences, so let's unpack it.  To help me offer more tailored support, could you tell me a little more about **what ""it"" is?**  You don't have to go into huge detail if you're not comfortable, but knowing *what* you're struggling with will help.  For example, is ""it"":

* **Difficulty trusting people?**
* **Fear of commitment?**
* **Low self-esteem?**
* **Anxiety in new relationships?**
* **Negative thought patterns?**
* **Something else entirely?**

However, even without knowing the specifics, here are some general thoughts and things to consider, broken down into sections, that might be helpful.  I'll also include some things you can *start doing* right now.

**1. Validating Your Feelings:**

* **It's okay to grieve.** Even if the relationship ended a long time ago, grief isn't time-limited. You're grieving the loss of the relationship, the future you imagined, and potentially your trust.
* **Your feelings are valid.** Don't minimize your pain or tell yourself you *shouldn't* feel a certain way.  Allow yourself to feel what you feel, without judgment.
* **Past experiences shape us.**  That relationship *did* impact you. It's not about excusing current behavior, but understanding its origins.

**2. Understanding the ""Blame"" Cycle:**

* **Blame provides a temporary sense of control.** It feels easier to point the finger at someone else than to look inward and address your own role (which isn't about *fault*, but about *growth*).
* **Blame keeps you stuck.** While acknowledging the other person's actions was harmful is important, continuously blaming prevents you from taking responsibility for your own healing and future.
* **Reframe it as ""influenced by.""**  Instead of ""I blame my past relationship for my trust issues,"" try ""My past relationship *influenced* my ability to trust, and I'm working on rebuilding that.""  It's a subtle shift, but a powerful one.

**3. What You Can Do *Now* (Small Steps):**

* **Self-Compassion:** This is HUGE. Talk to yourself like you would a friend going through the same thing.  Be kind, patient, and understanding.
* **Journaling:** Write down your thoughts and feelings.  Don't censor yourself.  Just let it flow.  Sometimes seeing it on paper can help you process it.  You can specifically journal about how the past relationship influences your current thoughts/feelings/behaviors.
* **Mindfulness/Meditation:**  Even 5-10 minutes a day can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without getting swept away by them.  There are tons of free guided meditations online (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer).
* **Identify Negative Thought Patterns:**  Start noticing when you're thinking negatively about yourself or future relationships.  Are you catastrophizing?  Are you generalizing?  Are you assuming the worst?  (More on this below)
* **Focus on Self-Care:**  Do things that make you feel good – hobbies, exercise, spending time with loved ones, taking a relaxing bath, etc.  Prioritizing your well-being is essential.

**4. Addressing Negative Thought Patterns (Cognitive Restructuring):**

This is a technique often used in therapy, but you can start practicing it yourself:

* **Identify the thought:** ""I'll never find someone who won't hurt me.""
* **Challenge the thought:** Is that *really* true? Is there evidence to support that thought?  Is there evidence against it?  Is this thought helpful?
* **Replace the thought:** ""My past relationship was painful, but it doesn't define my future.  I deserve to be with someone who treats me well, and I'm capable of finding that.""

**5. Consider Professional Help:**

* **Therapy is incredibly valuable.** A therapist can provide a safe and supportive space to explore your feelings, process your past, and develop coping mechanisms.  Cogn"
"I've never been able to talk with my parents. My parents are in their sixties while I am a teenager. I love both of them but not their personalities. I feel that they do not take me seriously whenever I talk about a serious event in my life. If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’m a pansexual, but I can’t trust my own parents.
 I've fought depression and won; however, stress and anxiety are killing me. I feel that my friends don't listen to me. I know they have their own problems, which I do my best to help with. But they don't always try to help me with mine, when I really need them. I feel as if my childhood has been taken from me. I feel as if I have no one whom I can trust.","One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. While your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard. Talk to them during a non-emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as ""you NEVER listen,"" ""you ALWAYS say..."" and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with ""you"" try using ""I"" by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist, teacher, or school counselor if possible. Most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help.Best of luck to you.","Okay, this sounds incredibly painful, and you're showing a lot of strength even *recognizing* all of this and reaching out (even just by writing it down, that's a huge step). It's completely understandable to feel lost and overwhelmed when you're carrying this much weight, especially as a teenager. Let's break down what you've shared and explore some potential paths forward.

**First, validating your feelings:**

* **It's okay to love your parents and dislike their personalities.** These are separate things. You can have affection for them as your parents without needing to *like* who they are as people.
* **Being dismissed is deeply invalidating.**  The feeling that your serious concerns aren't taken seriously, especially by parents, is incredibly damaging. It erodes trust and makes you feel unseen and unheard. Your experience is *real*, and your feelings are valid, regardless of their belief (or lack thereof).
* **Your experience with depression and anxiety is significant.** You *won* a battle with depression – that's huge! But it also means you're vulnerable to stress and anxiety, and it's okay to be struggling, especially with the other issues you're facing.
* **It's fair to want reciprocal support from friends.**  Friendships should be a two-way street. It's wonderful that you're there for them, but it's equally important to have friends who are there for *you*.
* **Feeling like your childhood was stolen is a very real and legitimate feeling.** This often comes from having responsibilities or emotional burdens placed on you too early, or from feeling unsupported and unsafe.
* **Feeling like you have no one to trust is incredibly isolating.** This is the core of what you're describing, and it's the most urgent thing to address.



**Let's look at each area and some potential steps:**

**1. Your Parents:**

This is the hardest one.  You've identified a pattern of dismissal and disbelief. Trying to *change* their personalities is likely impossible, and will likely just cause more frustration.  However, you can work on managing *your* reactions and setting boundaries.

* **Lower Expectations:**  This is painful, but accepting that they may not be the emotionally supportive parents you need can protect you from repeated disappointment.
* **Information Boundaries:** You don't *have* to share everything with them. Consider carefully what you tell them.  Information that's likely to be dismissed or met with negativity can be kept to yourself.  Focus on sharing neutral information (""I have a test on Friday"") rather than vulnerable feelings (""I'm really stressed about school"").
* **""Gray Rock"" Method:** This involves becoming emotionally unreactive.  If they dismiss something, you respond with short, neutral statements like ""Okay,"" or ""I see.""  Don't engage in arguments or try to convince them. It's about protecting your emotional energy.
* **Focus on Practical Matters:** Can you talk to them about logistics (school, chores, appointments) without it devolving into a place where your feelings are invalidated?
* **Regarding your Pansexuality:**  This is a particularly sensitive area. If you don't feel safe coming out to them, *do not*. Your safety and well-being are paramount.  You deserve to be accepted, but you also deserve to protect yourself.  There are other people who *will* accept you (see section 4).

**2. Your Friends:**

* **Honest Conversation (with care):**  Choose a friend you feel closest to and, at a good time, explain how you feel.  Something like, ""I'm really glad I can be there for you, and I appreciate you being my friend.  Lately, I've been feeling like I need some support too, and I've noticed it's hard to get that sometimes.  Could we talk about how we can both support each other better?""  *Avoid* blaming or accusatory language.  Focus on *your* feelings (""I feel..."") rather than *their* actions (""You never..."").
* **Observe Patterns:**  Are there specific friends who are consistently less supportive?  It might be time to re-evaluate those relationships.  It doesn't mean ending the friendship, but maybe creating some distance.
* **Seek Out Mutually Supportive Friendships:**  Look for friends who actively listen, ask about your well-being, and offer support without you having to constantly ask.
* **It's okay to have different levels of closeness.** Not every friend needs to be your confidante.


**3.  Your Emotional Wellbeing (Stress & Anxiety):**

* **Continue Prioritizing Mental Health:**  You’ve already overcome depression – that proves you have resilience and coping skills. Don’t abandon those."
"I think adult life is making him depressed and we often sleep in on weekends untill 1 or 2 pm. We just eat, smoke weed, watch movies, and he'll go on his phone all day. He doesn't seem motivated to do much and he's often angry.
    I have no clue how to help him take his mind off the negative, or to distract him into a different light. How do I help him?",How do you help yourself to believe you require more than what he offers to you?What do you get from this relationship which feels satisfying?To answer this question may in the longterm be the best way to help your bf.,"Okay, this sounds really tough, and you're a good partner for wanting to help. It's understandable why you're concerned – the pattern you describe is often associated with depression, and the anger is a common symptom.  It's great you're recognizing this and wanting to support him. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, covering things to understand, things to *try*, and important boundaries.  I'll also include a *very important disclaimer* at the end.

**1. Understanding What Might Be Going On**

* **Depression is More Than Sadness:** It's not just feeling down. It's a complex illness that can manifest as loss of interest in things he used to enjoy (anhedonia), fatigue, changes in sleep and appetite, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of hopelessness.  The withdrawal, the oversleeping, the lack of motivation, and the anger all fit this picture.
* **Weed & Depression - A Complex Relationship:**  While some people use marijuana to self-medicate for anxiety or depression, it can often *worsen* symptoms in the long run. It can interfere with sleep, motivation, and can sometimes exacerbate underlying anxiety. It's worth considering how much it might be contributing to the cycle.
* **Adulting is Hard:**  The transition to full adult responsibilities *is* incredibly stressful. Financial pressures, career uncertainty, relationship expectations – it's a lot to navigate. He may be overwhelmed and not know how to cope.
* **Underlying Issues:**  There might be other factors at play, like unresolved trauma, family history of mental health issues, or a physical health problem contributing to his mood.



**2. What You Can *Try* – Gentle Approaches**

* **Start with Empathy and Validation:**  Instead of saying ""You need to..."", try ""I've noticed you seem really down lately, and I'm worried about you. It sounds like things are really hard.""  Validate his feelings: ""It makes sense you're feeling angry/frustrated/overwhelmed with everything going on.""  Avoid minimizing his feelings (""Just cheer up!"")
* **The ""Small Steps"" Approach:**  Don't try to overhaul his life all at once. That will likely backfire.  Suggest *one* small, manageable activity.  Examples:
    * **""Hey, want to go for a 15-minute walk with me?""** (Low pressure, gets him moving)
    * **""I was thinking of making [his favorite meal] tonight. Would you want to help?""** (Involves him in something positive)
    * **""There's a [movie/show/event] I thought you might like.  No pressure, but just letting you know.""** (Offers a potential distraction)
* **Reintroduce Old Hobbies (Gently):**  ""Remember how much you used to enjoy [hobby]?  Maybe we could try doing that again sometime.""  Don't push it if he's not interested, but keep planting the seeds.
* **Suggest a New Shared Activity:**  Something you both can enjoy.  Cooking classes, a pottery workshop, hiking, volunteering – something that gets you both out and engaged.
* **Focus on Physical Health (Subtly):**  Suggest a healthy meal, a walk, or even just opening the curtains and letting in some sunlight.  These things can have a surprisingly positive impact on mood. *Don’t* make it about weight or appearance. Frame it as “I was thinking it would be nice to get some fresh air” or “I’m trying to eat a bit healthier and would love your company”.
* **Limit Enabling:** This is hard, but important. While it's tempting to let him withdraw, constantly accommodating the oversleeping, weed use, and inactivity can reinforce the cycle.  This *doesn’t* mean being cold or uncaring, but it means not always rescuing him from facing his feelings. (More on boundaries below).
* **Positive Reinforcement:** When he *does* engage in something positive, acknowledge it!  ""I really enjoyed our walk today. It was great to spend time with you.""



**3.  The Conversation About Seeking Help (This is Crucial)**

* **Choose the Right Time:**  Not when he's already angry or withdrawn.  A calm, quiet moment is best.
* **""I'm worried about you, and I think talking to a professional might help.""**  Frame it as something *you* want for him, because you care about him.
* **Normalize Therapy:** ""Lots of people benefit from therapy. It's a safe space to talk things through.""
* **Offer to Help:**  ""I'm happy to help you find a therapist, or even go with you to"
"I have so many issues to address. I have a history of sexual abuse, I’m a breast cancer survivor and I am a lifetime insomniac.    I have a long history of depression and I’m beginning to have anxiety. I have low self esteem but I’ve been happily married for almost 35 years.
   I’ve never had counseling about any of this. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling?",There is no such thing as too many issues for counseling. Many issues are often interrelated and can all be worked on with some time and patience.,"Okay, that is a *lot* to carry, and it's incredibly brave of you to even acknowledge it all, let alone ask this question.  It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when facing this depth of experience.  And you are absolutely not alone in having multiple, complex issues.

**To directly answer your question: No, you absolutely do *not* have too many issues to address in counseling.**  That's a myth.  In fact, it's incredibly *common* for people to present with multiple, interwoven challenges like yours.  A good therapist will be equipped to handle that complexity.

Here's a breakdown of why, and how a therapist would approach this, plus things to consider:

**Why it's *not* too much:**

* **Interconnectedness:** These issues aren't isolated. The sexual abuse likely impacts your self-esteem, anxiety, and potentially even your sleep.  The breast cancer experience is traumatic and can contribute to anxiety and depression.  The lifelong insomnia exacerbates everything. Depression often feeds anxiety and lowers self-worth.  A skilled therapist understands these connections.  Addressing one area *will* likely positively influence others.
* **Therapists are Trained for Complexity:**  Therapists, especially those with advanced training, are trained to work with complex trauma, co-occurring disorders (like depression and anxiety), and the impact of chronic illness. They don't see a ""list of problems""; they see a *person* with a unique history.
* **It's About Prioritization, Not Elimination:** Counseling isn't about ""fixing"" everything at once. It's about identifying what's most pressing *right now* and working from there. You and your therapist will collaborate to determine what feels most important to tackle first.
* **Your Marriage is a Strength:** The fact that you have a stable, happy marriage of 35 years is a *huge* asset.  That’s a source of support and resilience that many people don’t have.  It doesn’t negate the other issues, but it provides a foundation to build upon.



**How a Therapist Might Approach This (Different Approaches):**

There are several therapeutic approaches that could be helpful, and a good therapist will discuss these with you:

* **Trauma-Informed Therapy:** Given the history of sexual abuse, this is *crucial*.  This approach focuses on understanding the impact of trauma on your life and developing coping mechanisms.  Types include:
    * **EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing):** Highly effective for processing traumatic memories.
    * **Somatic Experiencing:** Focuses on releasing trauma held in the body.
    * **Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT):**  Helps to challenge negative thought patterns and develop coping skills.
* **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**  Excellent for addressing both anxiety and depression.  CBT helps identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors.  It can also be adapted to address insomnia (CBT-I - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia).
* **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):** Helps you accept difficult thoughts and feelings rather than struggling against them, and commit to living a values-driven life.
* **Psychodynamic Therapy:**  Explores how past experiences (like the abuse and cancer) shape present-day feelings and behaviors.  Can be a longer-term approach.
* **Mindfulness-Based Therapies:**  Can be very helpful for managing anxiety, depression, and insomnia by increasing present moment awareness.
* **Integrative Approach:** Many therapists use a combination of these approaches, tailoring treatment to your specific needs.

**What to Expect in the Beginning:**

* **Assessment:** The first few sessions will likely involve the therapist getting to know you, your history, and your current challenges. They'll ask a lot of questions.
* **Building Rapport:** It’s vital that you feel safe and comfortable with your therapist.  Don't be afraid to ""shop around"" until you find someone you connect with.
* **Goal Setting:** You and your therapist will work together to define your goals for therapy.  What do you want to achieve?  What would make your life better?
* **Pace:**  You control the pace. You don't have to dive into the trauma immediately. You can start with the insomnia or the anxiety, whatever feels most manageable.



**Practical Steps to Take:**

1. **Find a Therapist:**
   * **Psychology Today:**  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/](https://www.psychologytoday.com/)  (Excellent for finding therapists in your area, filtering by specialties like trauma, anxiety, depression, etc.)

After you've chosen somebody to try, feel free to call them for a consultation! A lot of counselors and therapists offer free consultations, and remember that your counselor is working for you, so make sure they are a good fit! I hope this has been of some help.","Okay, I'm really glad you're reaching out, even just by typing this. It takes courage to admit you're struggling, and it's a huge step to ask for help.  It's awful to feel depressed, and you deserve support. Here's a breakdown of ways to find someone to talk to, broken down by urgency and cost, with lots of options.  I'll also add a *very important disclaimer* at the end.

**First:  Are you in immediate danger?**

*   **If you are having thoughts of harming yourself, please stop and reach out *immediately*.**  Don't try to handle this alone.  Here are some resources that are available 24/7:
    *   **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text 988 in the US and Canada. In the UK, you can call 111.  These are free, confidential, and available 24/7.  https://988lifeline.org/
    *   **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741.  (US, Canada, UK, Ireland)

    *   **Call 111 (UK):**  For urgent, non-life-threatening mental health support.



**Okay, if you're not in immediate danger, let's look at options for finding someone to talk to. I'll categorize them by how formal/professional they are, and roughly by cost (though many have sliding scales or free options).**

**1. Immediate Support - Warm Lines & Peer Support (Free - Low Cost)**

These are great if you need to talk *now* but aren't in a crisis requiring 988.  They're often staffed by people with lived experience of mental health challenges.

*   **Warm Lines:**  These are non-crisis lines where you can talk to someone who understands.  They're about support, not intervention.  A directory is here: https://www.warmhelpline.org/
*   **Peer Support Networks:** Many organizations offer peer support groups, either online or in person.  These are groups of people who share similar experiences and can offer understanding and encouragement.  (See ""Organizations"" section below for leads).
*   **The Support Group Project:** https://www.supportgroupproject.com/  Offers a directory of various support groups.

**2.  Affordable Therapy/Counseling Options (Low Cost - Moderate Cost)**

*   **Community Mental Health Centers:**  These centers typically offer services on a sliding fee scale, based on your income.  They often have therapists, counselors, and sometimes psychiatrists.  Search online for ""[your city/county] mental health services"" or ""[your state] mental health department.""
*   **University/College Counseling Centers:** If you're a student, your school likely has a counseling center that offers free or low-cost services.  Even if you're not a student, some universities offer services to the community.
*   **Open Path Collective:** https://openpathcollective.org/  A network of therapists who offer reduced-fee sessions (typically $30-$80 per session) to people who can't afford traditional therapy.  There's a one-time membership fee.
*   **Online Therapy Platforms (often subscription-based):**
    *   **BetterHelp:** https://www.betterhelp.com/  (widely known, can be expensive but sometimes offers financial aid)
    *   **Talkspace:** https://www.talkspace.com/ (similar to BetterHelp)
    *   **Amwell:** https://amwell.com/ (offers therapy and other medical services)
    *   *Important Note:*  Online therapy is convenient, but it's not right for everyone.  It's generally best for mild to moderate depression.
*   **Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs):** If you're employed, check if your employer offers an EAP.  These programs usually provide a limited number of free counseling sessions.
*   **Non-Profit Organizations:** Many non-profits offer counseling services focused on specific issues (e.g., domestic violence, grief, addiction).  (See ""Organizations"" section below).

**3. Traditional Therapy/Counseling (Moderate - High Cost)**

*   **Psychologists, Therapists, Counselors:**  These professionals have different levels of training and expertise.

My fiancé and I broke up. He cheated on me numerous times. I kept forgiving but questioning his every move. He got tired and left.,if he as cheated on you multiple times it is not healthy for you to continue seeing him.  However It takes time to heal your pain. You are not a robot that can just switch off your emotions.  Please surround yourself with people who can support and empower you. ,"Okay, this is incredibly painful, and I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's a really tough situation, and it sounds like you've been carrying a lot of emotional weight for a long time. It's understandable to feel a whole range of emotions right now – sadness, anger, betrayal, relief, confusion... all of it is valid.

Let's break down what you've shared and talk about some things that might help.  It sounds like there's a cycle of hurt and forgiveness that finally led to this ending, and it's important to acknowledge all parts of that.

**Here's what stands out to me, and why it's important to address:**

* **Repeated Infidelity:**  The fact that the cheating wasn't a one-time thing is significant.  It demonstrates a pattern of disrespect for you and the relationship.  This isn't about a ""mistake,"" but about choices he repeatedly made.
* **Your Forgiveness & Questioning:** You're very self-aware to recognize you kept forgiving *but* it came at a cost. The constant questioning, the need to check up on him – that's a natural response to being betrayed, but it's also exhausting and erodes your own sense of peace and self-worth.  It’s a sign of deep insecurity *caused by his actions*, not a flaw in *you*.
* **His Leaving:** He says he ""got tired and left."" While it feels incredibly unfair to have it framed that way, and it’s likely a way to deflect responsibility, it also highlights that the dynamic wasn't sustainable for *him*.  He wasn't willing to address the core issues, and he wasn't willing to build the trust that a healthy relationship requires.  It's a painful truth, but sometimes people leave not because you're ""too much,"" but because they aren't willing to do the work.
* **The Cycle:**  You were caught in a cycle of hoping things would change, forgiving, then feeling the need to control the situation because you didn't trust him. This cycle is incredibly damaging, and breaking it, even though it's painful, is ultimately the healthiest thing for you.



**Right now, what you need to focus on is *you*. Here's a breakdown of things that might help, broken down into sections:**

**1. Allow Yourself to Grieve:**

* **Feel the emotions:** Don't try to suppress your feelings. Cry, scream into a pillow, journal, talk to a friend – whatever you need to do to release the pain.  It's okay to be devastated.
* **Acknowledge the loss:** Even though the relationship was unhealthy, it was still a significant part of your life, and it's okay to mourn the future you imagined.
* **Don't minimize his actions:**  It's easy to fall into the trap of making excuses for him or minimizing the hurt.  Hold onto the truth of what happened.  He betrayed your trust.
* **Time:** Grief takes time. There's no set timeline. Be patient with yourself.

**2.  Break the Cycle of Self-Blame:**

* **You are not responsible for his choices.**  His infidelity was *his* decision, and no amount of questioning or forgiveness would have changed that if he wasn’t willing to change himself.
* **Questioning was a symptom, not a cause.**  Your questioning stemmed from his actions, not from a lack of trust on your part initially. It was a way to cope with the uncertainty and pain.
* **Recognize your strength:** You *did* have the strength to forgive, even when it was incredibly difficult.  Now, you need to direct that strength towards yourself.
* **Avoid ruminating:**  It’s easy to replay things over and over.  When you find yourself doing that, gently redirect your thoughts. (See section 4)

**3.  Prioritize Self-Care:**

* **Basic needs:**  Ensure you're eating, sleeping, and staying hydrated. These are often the first things to go during emotional distress, but they're essential for healing.
* **Activities you enjoy:**  Reconnect with hobbies and activities that bring you joy, even if you don't feel like it at first.
* **Physical activity:** Exercise is a great stress reliever and can boost your mood.
* **Spend time with supportive people:** Lean on friends and family who love and care about you.
* **Set boundaries:**  Limit contact with your ex. Unfollow him on social media.  You need space to heal.  (This is *crucial*).

**4.  Seek Support (Highly Recommended):**

* **Therapy:**  A therapist can provide a safe and non"
"I have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.","Something to remember about anxiety is that it's a useful and necessary response to stressors, and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming. Anxiety is our brain's way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action. Some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. The first I'd recommend is a calm breathing technique - breathe in for 4-5 seconds, and then out for 7-8 seconds. Try to repeat this for 3-5 minutes. Another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe - without judging - the sensations to yourself. Try to be very specific, such as ""my palms are feeling very sweaty, and I can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies."" Then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad - just experiencing them as intentionally as possible.  Combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful. If you feel that these techniques don't help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to, then I'd highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional. This professional can help you determine if therapy/counseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms.","Okay, it's incredibly common to feel anxious about those things! You're definitely not alone. Finances, work, relationships, kids, and household upkeep are *huge* sources of stress for most people. It's good you're recognizing this and wanting to address it.  Here's a breakdown of how to approach these anxieties, covering understanding, coping strategies, and when to seek professional help.  I'll try to be thorough, so this is a long response, but hopefully helpful.  I'll categorize it into sections: Understanding Your Anxiety, Immediate Coping Techniques, Longer-Term Strategies, and When to Seek Professional Help.

**1. Understanding Your Anxiety**

* **Normal vs. Problematic Anxiety:**  It's normal to experience anxiety when facing real-life stressors. It's a signal that something feels challenging or uncertain. *Problematic* anxiety is when the anxiety is disproportionate to the situation, interferes with your daily life, causes significant distress, and is hard to control.  You've already identified areas of stress, which is a good first step.
* **Identify Your Triggers:**  Specifically *what* about each area triggers your anxiety?  Be precise.
    * **Finances:** Is it the amount of debt?  Unpredictable income?  Fear of not being able to provide?  Specific bills?  The feeling of losing control?
    * **Work:** Is it workload?  Boss/colleague relationships?  Job security?  Feeling inadequate?  Work-life balance?
    * **Relationships:**  Conflict?  Feeling unsupported?  Fear of abandonment?  Communication issues?  Worries about loved ones?
    * **Kids:**  Their health?  Their future?  Their behavior?  The responsibility?  Guilt about not being a 'perfect' parent?
    * **Household:**  The endless to-do list?  The feeling of being overwhelmed?  Maintaining cleanliness?  Repairs?
* **Physical Symptoms:**  What does your anxiety *feel* like in your body?  Rapid heartbeat?  Muscle tension?  Sweating?  Difficulty breathing?  Headaches?  Stomach upset?  Recognizing these physical cues can be a warning sign to use coping techniques.
* **Thought Patterns:** What are you *thinking* when you're anxious?  Common anxiety-driven thought patterns include:
    * **Catastrophizing:**  Imagining the worst possible outcome. (""If I lose my job, we'll lose the house!"")
    * **Overgeneralization:**  Drawing broad conclusions from a single event. (""I messed up one presentation, I'm terrible at my job."")
    * **Black-and-White Thinking:**  Seeing things in extremes. (""If I'm not perfect, I'm a failure."")
    * **""Should"" Statements:**  Pressuring yourself with rigid rules. (""I *should* be able to handle this."")



**2. Immediate Coping Techniques (When Anxiety Spikes)**

These are things you can do *in the moment* to calm yourself down.  Experiment to find what works best for you.

* **Deep Breathing:**  Box breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4) is excellent. Diaphragmatic breathing (belly breathing) is also very effective.
* **Grounding Techniques:** Bring yourself back to the present moment.
    * **5-4-3-2-1:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Physical Sensations:** Focus on the feeling of your feet on the ground, the texture of your clothes, or the temperature of the air.
* **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR):**  Tense and release different muscle groups in your body.  There are guided PMR recordings available online (YouTube, apps like Calm or Headspace).
* **Mindful Awareness:**  Observe your thoughts and feelings without judgment.  Acknowledge them (""I'm feeling anxious right now""), but don't get carried away by them.
* **Short Walk/Movement:**  Even a 5-10 minute walk can help release endorphins and reduce tension.
* **Listen to Calming Music:**  Instrumental music, nature sounds, or whatever you find soothing.
* **Journaling:**  Write down your anxious thoughts.  Sometimes just getting them out of your head can help.




**3. Longer-Term Strategies (To Reduce Overall Anxiety)**

These require consistent effort, but can significantly reduce your overall anxiety levels.

* **Time Management & Prioritization:**
    * **To-Do Lists:** Break down large tasks into smaller,"
"I am a really shy person. I'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?","I can offer you hypnosis for confidence in presentations, via Skype, if you're in Cali.","Okay, it's *totally* understandable to feel stressed and less confident about presentations when you're naturally shy, especially in a demanding graduate program! You're definitely not alone. Here's a breakdown of strategies, categorized for how much effort they take, and focusing on building confidence specifically for presentations.  I'll also try to address the *why* behind the anxiety, because understanding that helps too.

**Understanding Your Shyness & Presentation Anxiety**

First, a little self-compassion. Shyness isn't a flaw; it's a temperament. It often stems from a heightened awareness of social judgment.  Presentation anxiety is a specific form of social anxiety, fueled by fears like:

* **Negative Evaluation:**  ""They'll think I'm stupid."" ""They'll see I'm nervous.""
* **Fear of Mistakes:** ""I'll forget what to say."" ""I'll stumble over my words.""
* **Physical Symptoms:**  Fear of blushing, sweating, trembling, voice shaking.
* **Perfectionism:**  The belief you *have* to deliver a flawless presentation.



**I. Quick Wins & Immediate Relief (Low Effort - For Right Before a Presentation)**

These are things you can do in the days/hours *leading up to* and *right before* a presentation. They won't magically cure your shyness, but they can dial down the immediate anxiety.

* **Deep Breathing:** This is *huge*.  Practice diaphragmatic breathing (belly breathing).  Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose, letting your stomach rise. Exhale slowly through your mouth.  Do 5-10 breaths.  Do this *before* you even start getting ready, and again right before you speak.  Apps like Calm or Headspace can guide you.
* **Grounding Techniques:**  If you feel panic rising, use grounding.  Examples:
    * **5-4-3-2-1:**  Name 5 things you can *see*, 4 things you can *touch*, 3 things you can *hear*, 2 things you can *smell*, and 1 thing you can *taste*.
    * **Feel Your Feet:**  Really focus on the sensation of your feet on the floor.  Push them into the ground.
* **Positive Self-Talk (But Realistic):**  Instead of ""I'm going to be amazing!"" try ""I've prepared well, and I can get through this.""  Or ""It's okay to be a little nervous; it's a normal reaction."" Avoid negative self-talk (""I'm going to fail"").
* **Visualize Success:**  Close your eyes and imagine yourself delivering the presentation confidently and calmly.  See the audience engaged. Hear yourself speaking clearly.  (Don't visualize *perfectly* – visualize *successfully*).
* **Power Pose (Briefly):**  Amy Cuddy's research (some debated now, but still potentially helpful) suggests that adopting a ""power pose"" for a couple of minutes before a stressful situation can temporarily boost confidence.  Examples: hands on hips, arms raised in a V.
* **Focus on Your Message, Not Yourself:** Remind yourself *why* you're giving the presentation. What information are you sharing that's valuable? This shifts the focus outward.




**II.  Building Confidence Through Preparation (Medium Effort - Consistent Practice)**

This is where you'll make the biggest gains, but it takes consistent effort *before* presentations become imminent.

* **Practice, Practice, Practice:**  This is the most important thing.  Seriously.
    * **Out Loud:** Don't just read through your slides silently.  Practice speaking the presentation *out loud*, as if you're actually giving it.
    * **Record Yourself:**  Video record yourself. It's cringey at first, but invaluable.  You'll notice things you can improve (pace, filler words, body language).  Don't obsess over perfection, just identify areas for adjustment.
    * **Practice in Front of Others:** Start with trusted friends or family. Then, maybe a small group of classmates.  Ask for constructive feedback. (Specifically ask for feedback on clarity and pace, not just ""was it good?"")
    * **Practice with the Technology:**  Make sure you're comfortable with the presentation software, the clicker, the projector, etc. Technical glitches add to anxiety.
* **Know Your Material Inside and Out:**  The more you understand your topic, the less you'll rely on memorization (which can fail you) and the more you can speak conversationally.  Anticipate potential questions.
* **Structure Your Presentation Clearly:** A well-organized presentation is easier to deliver *and* easier for the audience to follow.  Use a clear introduction"
What makes a healthy marriage last?,"Thank you for your question.  A good Marriage is one that takes hard work and commitment.  Being in a good marriage does not always mean good times because let's face it; we are dealing with 2 unique individuals with differences.  A good spouse or partner knows to be patient and accepting.  Knowing each other's strengths and imperfections and working with them to lift each other is how you strengthen your love for one another.  A good spouse sacrifices their needs to see the other person happy.  Don't get me wrong, that also means that it is important to have alone time to re-charge and re-focus our purpose in the marriage.  In all, there is not a magic recipe for a successful marriage, but with time, work and purpose one can have a happy one.","Okay, so you're asking about the ingredients for a lasting, healthy marriage! It's a complex topic, but here's a breakdown of key elements, categorized for clarity.  It's not a magic formula, but a consistent effort in many areas.  I'll try to be thorough, covering emotional, practical, and individual aspects.  I'll also break it down into sections with headings.

**I. Core Foundations: The ""Must-Haves""**

*   **Mutual Respect:** This is *fundamental*. It means valuing your partner's opinions, feelings, and personhood, even when you disagree. It translates to *how* you talk to each other – avoiding insults, contempt, and dismissiveness.  Respect also includes acknowledging their efforts and contributions.
*   **Trust:**  Without trust, a marriage erodes quickly.  Trust is built over time through honesty, reliability, and keeping commitments. It's about believing your partner has your best interests at heart.  This includes both fidelity *and* emotional honesty.
*   **Commitment:** A deep, unwavering commitment to the relationship, even during tough times. This isn't just staying together; it's actively *choosing* each other, repeatedly. It's a long-term perspective.  It means prioritizing ""we"" over ""me"" in important decisions.
*   **Love & Affection:**  This sounds obvious, but it needs constant nurturing. It's not just the initial romantic love, but a deeper, more mature love built on companionship, shared history, and genuine care.  Physical affection (holding hands, hugging, kissing, intimacy) is important for many couples.
*   **Honesty & Open Communication:** Being able to talk about anything, even difficult things, without fear of judgment or retaliation.  This includes sharing feelings, needs, and vulnerabilities.  It's also about being truthful, even when it's hard.



**II.  Communication & Conflict Resolution – How You Interact**

*   **Effective Communication Skills:**  This is a skillset! It involves:
    *   **Active Listening:** Truly hearing and understanding your partner’s perspective.  Paraphrasing, asking clarifying questions, and making eye contact are key.
    *   **""I"" Statements:**  Expressing your feelings and needs without blaming your partner (""I feel frustrated when..."" instead of ""You always..."").
    *   **Empathy:**  Trying to understand your partner’s feelings, even if you don’t agree with their viewpoint.
    *   **Non-Verbal Communication Awareness:**  Being mindful of your body language and tone of voice.
*   **Healthy Conflict Resolution:**  Conflicts are inevitable.  The key is *how* you handle them.
    *   **Fair Fighting:** Avoiding personal attacks, name-calling, and bringing up the past. Focusing on the *current* issue.
    *   **Compromise:**  Being willing to meet your partner halfway.  Not every argument needs a ""winner"" and a ""loser.""
    *   **Knowing When to Take a Break:**  If things get too heated, taking a break to cool down before resuming the conversation.
    *  **Forgiveness:** Letting go of resentment and moving forward after a conflict.  Holding onto grudges is toxic.
*   **Regular Check-Ins:**  Scheduling dedicated time to talk about the relationship – what's working, what's not, and what needs attention. This prevents small issues from becoming big ones.

**III.  Shared Life & Practical Matters**

*   **Shared Values & Goals:**  Being on the same page about important life values (family, finances, religion, career, etc.) makes it easier to navigate major decisions.  Having shared goals gives you something to work towards together.
*   **Financial Compatibility:**  Money is a major source of stress in many marriages.  Having open communication about finances, creating a budget, and agreeing on spending habits are crucial.
*   **Division of Labor:**  A fair and equitable division of household chores and responsibilities. This doesn’t necessarily mean a 50/50 split, but it should feel balanced and respectful.
*   **Quality Time Together:**  Making time for each other, even amidst busy schedules. This could be date nights, shared hobbies, or simply spending uninterrupted time talking.
*   **Shared Activities & Interests:**  Having things you enjoy doing together strengthens your bond. It doesn't have to be everything, but having *some* overlapping interests is beneficial.
* **Support of Individual Interests:** While shared activities are good, it's also important to support each other's individual hobbies and passions.  This shows respect for each other's individuality.

**IV.  Individual Well-being – Taking Care of Yourself**

*   **"
"He isn't violent, but he has anger issues and deep insecurities. He's working on them and has improved. We started counseling, and he participated in one or two individual sessions, but we broke up again shortly thereafter. Now his constant questions and accusations are getting really draining.","From what you write, you're not too happy with how your boyfriend treats you and how he handles his own life.What keeps you feeling connected to him in positive ways?If you're truly not happy most of the time in this relationship, then you're at the time of asking why you'd want to remain in a relationship which is draining.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and it sounds incredibly draining for you. It's good he's *been* working on things, and that he's acknowledged his issues, but it's also understandable that his current behavior is pushing you away, especially after the relationship ended. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, why, and how to navigate this, broken down into sections.  I'll also add a disclaimer at the end.

**Understanding What's Going On**

* **Insecurity & Control:** The constant questions and accusations, even without violence, are often rooted in insecurity.  He's likely trying to control the situation (and you) to alleviate his own anxiety.  It's a way to seek reassurance, but a very unhealthy one.  He's likely fearing abandonment or rejection, and his brain is going into overdrive trying to ""prove"" something or catch you in a lie (even if you haven't done anything wrong).
* **Regression:** The breakup, even if he wanted it initially or it was mutual, can be triggering for someone with insecurities. It validates their fears of being unwanted or unlovable. His behavior may be a *regression* to earlier patterns before he'd made progress in counseling. He may be slipping back into old coping mechanisms.
* **Unresolved Issues from Counseling:** One or two individual sessions are often not enough to make significant, lasting change. The fact that counseling stopped so soon after the breakup suggests either he wasn’t ready to truly dive deep, or the breakup derailed the process. He might have been hoping counseling *would* fix the relationship, and its failure is adding to his distress.
* **Your Needs Matter:** This is *huge*. You've already started recognizing this, but it's worth repeating.  Your emotional well-being is paramount.  Being constantly questioned and accused is emotionally abusive, even if it doesn’t escalate to physical violence. It erodes your trust and self-worth.



**Why This is So Draining**

* **Emotional Labor:**  Responding to accusations and constantly reassuring someone takes a *lot* of energy. You're essentially becoming his emotional regulator, which is not your responsibility.
* **Walking on Eggshells:**  You're likely censoring yourself, anticipating his reactions, and modifying your behavior to avoid triggering him. This creates constant stress and prevents you from being authentic.
* **Lack of Reciprocity:** He's demanding reassurance from *you* while seemingly not offering it in return, or not addressing *your* needs.
* **It Feels Like He's Not Taking Responsibility:** Even if he acknowledges he *has* issues, his current actions demonstrate he isn't fully taking responsibility for *managing* them in a way that doesn’t harm you.



**What You Can Do (and What You *Should* Do)**

This is where it gets tricky, as you've already broken up. You are not obligated to be his therapist.

1. **Firm Boundaries (This is the most important):**
   * **Limit Contact:**  This is crucial.  You need space to heal and protect yourself.  This might mean:
      * **Responding only when *absolutely* necessary.**
      * **Not engaging with accusatory questions.**  Instead of defending yourself, you can say, “I’m not going to respond to questions based on accusations.” or simply “I’m not discussing this.”
      * **Consider a temporary or permanent block on his number/social media.** This is not a punishment, but self-preservation.
   * **Be Direct & Clear:** When you *do* have to communicate, be concise and direct.  Avoid lengthy explanations or justifications.
   * **“I” Statements:**  Focus on how his behavior affects *you*.  For example, instead of ""You're always accusing me,"" say, ""When I'm constantly questioned, I feel distrusted and it makes it hard for me to want to communicate.""
   * **Repeat Your Boundaries:** He will likely test them. Be prepared to calmly and consistently reiterate them.  Don't get drawn into arguments.
2. **Don't Get Sucked into Debates:**  He may try to argue with your boundaries or make you feel guilty.  Don't engage.  A simple, ""This is what I need right now,"" is sufficient.
3. **Focus on Your Healing:**  This is your time.  Reconnect with friends and family, pursue hobbies, and prioritize your own well-being.
4. **Consider Counseling for *Yourself*:** This can help you process the relationship, reinforce your boundaries, and develop coping mechanisms for dealing with his behavior.
5. **Regarding his claims of improvement:** While it’s good he *has* shown some insight, it's not enough to justify continued"
"Sometime when small thing happen, like losing a comb, I get furious.  I even start throwing things. Do I have a problem?","I don't like the word ""problem"".  It is such a strong word.  However I would say that you have an issue that needs to be addressed and controlled before it directed at the wrong person and gets totally out of control.  I have found that anger management classes has been helpful for my clients.  Try and see if it will help.  You will be surprised at what you learn about your self.","Okay, this is a really good question to ask, and it's smart of you to recognize that your reaction seems disproportionate to the event.  Yes, it *sounds like* you might have a problem, or at least a pattern of behavior that you'd benefit from understanding and potentially addressing. Here's a breakdown of why, what might be happening, and what you can do about it.  I'll try to be thorough and sensitive.  (Please read the disclaimer at the end, as I am not a medical professional.)

**Why this is concerning:**

* **Disproportionate Reaction:** Getting *furious* and throwing things over a lost comb is significantly more intense than a typical reaction (mild annoyance, frustration). This suggests the comb isn't really the issue.
* **Potential for Harm:** Throwing things is dangerous. You could hurt yourself or someone else, and/or damage property.  Even if you *don't* hit anyone, the act itself is a sign of losing control.
* **Underlying Issues:** These outbursts are likely symptoms of something deeper going on.  They're a way your emotions are manifesting, and it's worth figuring out *what* those underlying emotions are.
* **Impact on Relationships:**  Even if no one is physically hurt, outbursts like this can be frightening or upsetting to people around you. They can damage trust and create distance in your relationships.
* **Stress & Well-being:**  Constantly experiencing such intense anger is exhausting and detrimental to your own well-being.



**What might be happening?  Possible explanations:**

There are several possibilities, and it's often a combination of factors. Here are some common ones:

* **Unmanaged Stress:** You might be carrying a lot of stress from other areas of your life (work, relationships, finances, health, etc.).  Small things then become the ""last straw"" because your emotional capacity is already full. This is sometimes called ""emotional flooding.""
* **Underlying Anxiety or Depression:**  These conditions can often manifest as irritability and anger, even over seemingly minor things.  Sometimes anger is a ""mask"" for deeper sadness or fear.
* **Past Trauma:**  Past traumatic experiences can make you more reactive to triggers, even if those triggers don't logically connect to the trauma.  Your nervous system might be hyper-vigilant.
* **Emotional Regulation Difficulties:**  Some people struggle with the ability to manage and regulate their emotions effectively. This could be due to temperament, learned behaviors, or neurological factors.
* **Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED):** This is a specific diagnosis characterized by sudden episodes of intense anger, often with aggressive impulses. *However, self-diagnosing is not a good idea* – a professional evaluation is needed.
* **Perfectionism/High Standards:** If you hold yourself to very high standards, even small imperfections or inconveniences can feel like major failures, triggering anger.
* **Feeling of Lack of Control:** If you feel like you lack control in other areas of your life, you might be trying to exert control through these outbursts (even though it's not a healthy way to do so).
* **Physical Health Factors:** Sometimes, underlying medical conditions (hormonal imbalances, chronic pain, etc.) can contribute to irritability and anger.



**What you can do about it:**

1. **Self-Reflection and Journaling:**  Start paying attention to *when* these outbursts happen. What was going on *before* you lost the comb? What were you thinking about? How were you feeling?  Journaling can help you identify patterns and triggers. Ask yourself:
   * What specifically makes you so angry? Is it the loss of the item, the inconvenience, or something else?
   * What thoughts run through your head when you start to feel angry?
   * What physical sensations do you experience (e.g., racing heart, clenched fists)?

2. **Develop Coping Mechanisms (Before you get angry):**
   * **Deep Breathing Exercises:**  Practice deep, slow breathing to calm your nervous system. (Box breathing is a good technique: inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4).
   * **Mindfulness & Meditation:**  These practices can help you become more aware of your emotions and thoughts without getting carried away by them.
   * **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:**  Tensing and relaxing different muscle groups can help release physical tension.
   * **Physical Exercise:** Regular exercise is a great stress reliever.
   * **Grounding Techniques:** When you feel overwhelmed, try grounding yourself by focusing on your senses:  name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.

3. **In the Moment Strategies"
I recently lost a friend to suicide. I'm smoking marijuana and drinking more to cope with it. How can I handle this better?,"Suicide is a very traumatic loss and affects survivors significantly. Everyone deals with their grief in different ways. One way I recommend to deal with the loss of a loved one is to write letters to them. Some people like to keep the letters in a jar, maybe fill the jar with sand so the letters are buried. I recommend writing the letters as often as you need to. You will notice over time the need to write the letters will decrease and the intense feelings of loss will decrease. I also recommend finding a survivors support group in your area. You can find more information on www.afsp.org.","Okay, I'm so incredibly sorry to hear about the loss of your friend. That's a profoundly painful experience, and it's completely understandable that you're hurting and looking for ways to cope.  It's also really brave of you to recognize that your current coping mechanisms – the increased marijuana and alcohol – aren't likely to help in the long run, and to reach out for suggestions. That self-awareness is a really important first step.  Here's a breakdown of how you can handle this, covering immediate steps, understanding why those substances feel temporarily helpful, and building healthier long-term coping strategies.  I'll also include resources at the end.

**1. Acknowledge the Grief (and the Substance Use as a Symptom)**

*   **It's Normal to Hurt:**  There's no ""right"" way to grieve, and there's no timeline.  Allow yourself to feel the sadness, anger, confusion, guilt, and any other emotions that come up.  Don't judge yourself for feeling them.
*   **Substance Use is a Coping Mechanism:**  What you're doing – turning to marijuana and alcohol – is a very common response to trauma and grief. It's *not* a moral failing. It's a way your brain is trying to self-medicate, to numb the pain. Recognizing this is key.  It doesn't make it *good*, but it makes it understandable.
*   **Temporary Relief, Long-Term Harm:**  The relief you feel is temporary.  Alcohol and marijuana can worsen grief in the long run. They can interfere with the natural grieving process, exacerbate depression and anxiety, and lead to other problems, including dependence. They can also make it harder to think clearly and make good decisions.



**2. Immediate Steps to Take (Today/Tomorrow)**

*   **Reach Out – Seriously:**  I know it's hard, but connect with someone.  This could be:
    *   **A family member:**  Even if it feels awkward, someone who cares about you.
    *   **A friend (other than those you typically use with):**  Someone you trust to listen without judgment.
    *   **A grief counselor or therapist (see resources below):**  A professional can provide a safe space to process your emotions.  Many offer free or low-cost initial consultations.
    *   **A crisis line (see resources below):**  If you're feeling overwhelmed or having thoughts of harming yourself.
*   **Reduce (Don't Necessarily Stop Cold Turkey):**  Trying to stop completely *right now* can be really difficult and may lead to feeling more overwhelmed.  Instead, aim for *reduction*.  
    *   **Marijuana:**  Reduce the frequency and amount you use.  If you smoke multiple times a day, try cutting back to a few times.  If you use a lot, reduce the amount.
    *   **Alcohol:**  Set limits for how many drinks you'll have, and stick to them.  Alternate alcoholic drinks with water.  Choose lower-alcohol options.
*   **Hydrate and Nourish:**  Grief can disrupt your appetite and make you forget to take care of yourself.  Drink plenty of water and eat regular, nutritious meals, even if you don't feel like it.
* **Create a Calm Space:** Identify a place where you can relax and feel safe. This could be a quiet room in your house, a park, or anywhere that brings you peace.



**3.  Building Healthier Coping Strategies (Longer Term)**

*   **Therapy:**  This is the *most* important step. A therapist specializing in grief and loss can provide:
    *   **A safe space to process your emotions:** Without judgment.
    *   **Tools for managing grief:**  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and other approaches can help you challenge negative thought patterns and develop coping skills.
    *   **Support for addressing substance use:**  A therapist can help you understand why you're using substances and develop strategies for reducing or stopping.
*   **Grief Support Groups:**  Connecting with others who have experienced similar losses can be incredibly validating and helpful.  You'll realize you're not alone.  (See resources below).
*   **Healthy Distractions:**  Find activities that can take your mind off your grief, even for a little while.  These could include:
    *   **Exercise:**  Physical activity releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects.  Even a walk can help.
    *   **Creative expression:**  Writing, painting, music, or any other creative outlet can be therapeutic.
    *   **Spending time in nature:**  Being outdoors can be calming and restorative.

"Maybe this is a stupid question, but I sometimes don't know what's real or not. If feel at times like everyone's lying. How do I know if God is one of those lies?","  It is not a stupid question, it is very basic. To help answer your question, let me begin with the premise that you will never have absolute proof. With that being said, one can look at different phenomena in nature and history and figure what is the statistical probability that they happened randomly. If one comes to the logical conclusion that many are quite improbable, then there must be a guiding force and plan.  May you be successful in your journey.","Okay, that's *absolutely not* a stupid question. It's a really profound one, and it's incredibly brave of you to ask it. Feeling like you can't trust what's real, and extending that distrust to something as fundamental as faith, is a really difficult place to be.  It sounds like you're grappling with some deep uncertainty, and that's okay.  Let's break this down, and I'll try to offer some helpful thoughts.  I'll cover a lot of ground, and feel free to tell me if any part doesn't resonate or if you want me to focus on something specific.

**First, Let's Validate Your Feeling**

It's completely understandable to feel like people are lying. We *are* sometimes lied to.  We're bombarded with information, much of it curated or biased.  Disappointment and betrayal can happen.  So, developing a level of healthy skepticism is natural.  However, when that skepticism spirals into *constant* distrust, it's a sign that something deeper is going on, and it can be really unsettling.  It can stem from things like:

*   **Past trauma:**  Experiences where you were betrayed or deceived can make it hard to trust anyone, including abstract concepts like faith.
*   **Anxiety and/or Depression:** These can distort your thinking and make you focus on negative possibilities.
*   **Existential questioning:**  It's normal to question the meaning of life and the nature of reality, especially during times of change or stress.
*   **Personality traits:** Some people naturally have a more questioning or skeptical disposition.

The fact that you're applying this distrust to the idea of God is a logical extension of that overall feeling. If you struggle to trust people, why would you automatically trust something you can't see or prove?



**Why It's Hard to ""Prove"" or ""Disprove"" God**

This is the core of your question.  God, as typically conceived, isn't something you can hold in your hand, observe in a lab, or empirically verify.  Here's why:

*   **The Nature of Faith:**  Faith, by its very definition, involves belief in something *without* absolute proof.  If you had absolute proof, you wouldn't *need* faith.
*   **The Limitations of Human Understanding:**  Many believe God transcends human comprehension.  Trying to fit an infinite being into our finite minds is inherently limiting.
*   **Different Conceptions of God:** ""God"" means different things to different people.  There's not a single, universally agreed-upon definition. Some see God as a personal being, others as a force, others as the universe itself.
*   **The Problem of Evil:**  The existence of suffering in the world is a major challenge to the idea of a benevolent, all-powerful God. (We'll touch on this later).

**How Do People Approach This Question?  Different Perspectives:**

Here are a few ways people grapple with the question of God's reality, and none of them are necessarily ""right"" or ""wrong"":

*   **Faith-Based Belief:**  This relies on personal experience, revelation, scripture, tradition, and a sense of connection to the divine.  For many, faith *feels* true, even without concrete proof. It's a deeply personal conviction.
*   **Rational Theology/Philosophy:**  This uses reason and logic to argue for or against God's existence.  Examples include:
    *   **Cosmological Argument:**  Everything must have a cause, so there must be an uncaused cause (God).
    *   **Teleological Argument:**  The universe exhibits order and design, suggesting an intelligent designer (God).
    *   **Ontological Argument:**  The very concept of God implies God's existence. (This is a complex one!).
*   **Agnosticism:**  The belief that the existence or non-existence of God is unknowable.  Agnostics don't claim to know either way.
*   **Atheism:**  The disbelief in the existence of God.  This can range from a lack of belief to a positive assertion that God does not exist.
*   **Existentialism:**  This philosophical school focuses on individual freedom and responsibility.  Some existentialists believe that even if God doesn't exist, we must create our own meaning and values.
*   **Spiritual but Not Religious:**  Many people feel a sense of spirituality or connection to something larger than themselves without adhering to a specific religion or belief in a traditional God.



**Ways to Explore Your Own Beliefs (Without Pressure)**

Given your distrust, forcing yourself to *believe* won't work.  Instead, consider these approaches:

1.  **"
"I feel that I need to end my present relationship. He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.","It sounds like you have some insight into the cycle that you describe with your current relationship and at the same time you are still feeling stuck. It also sounds like the distressing feelings that you experience, when you imagine what will happen for you and your current partner, are pretty overwhelming. A competent therapist may be able to help you work through these difficult thoughts and feelings and find a resolution to this cycle that will feel right to you.","Okay, this is a really tough situation, and you're incredibly insightful to recognize the pattern you're in. You've clearly put a lot of thought into this, and the fact that you're acknowledging it's *unhealthy* is a huge step. Let's break this down, addressing the core issues and potential ways forward.

**Understanding What's Happening**

* **Valid Needs:** Your needs are completely valid. Wanting a present, actively engaged life partner is a healthy desire. The long distance combined with his work schedule is genuinely preventing that, and your frustration is justified. You're not being unreasonable.
* **The Cycle of Anxiety & Reconcilation:** This is the key. You identify a problem, communicate it, feel the anxiety of potential loss/loneliness, and then *return* to the familiar, even though the core issue remains unaddressed. This is a powerful cycle driven by fear.  It's not about *him* necessarily, it's about *your* fear of being alone and facing those uncomfortable feelings.
* **Fear of the Unknown:** The anxiety about never meeting someone else is a common fear, amplified by the length of your relationship.  Seven years is a significant investment, and the thought of ""starting over"" can be terrifying.  The fear is rooted in the ""what ifs.""
* **The Reassurance Habit:**  His need for constant communication might be a coping mechanism for *him* related to the distance, but it's also reinforcing a dynamic that doesn't fulfill *your* needs. You're becoming a source of reassurance rather than a partner in a fulfilling relationship.
* **Loss Aversion:**  Psychologically, humans often feel the pain of a loss more strongly than the potential pleasure of a gain.  The pain of losing him (even a relationship that isn’t ideal) feels more immediate and powerful than the *possibility* of finding someone better.



**Why This is Unhealthy & Why Breaking the Cycle is Important**

Continuing this cycle will likely lead to:

* **Resentment:** Your anger and frustration will continue to build, eroding any affection you have left.
* **Stunted Growth:**  You're preventing yourself from being open to a relationship that *does* meet your needs.
* **Decreased Self-Worth:**  Staying in a situation that doesn't fulfill you can erode your sense of self-worth and reinforce a belief that you ""deserve"" less than you want.
* **Prolonged Suffering:**  You're essentially prolonging the inevitable pain and adding years of unhappiness.




**Strategies to Break the Cycle - This is the Hard Part!**

Here's a plan, broken down into steps.  This isn't about ""dumping"" him impulsively, but about making a conscious, informed decision *and* preparing yourself to cope with the aftermath.

**1. Firm Boundaries & No Re-Negotiation (This is CRITICAL):**

* **You've already started this!**  You've told him how you feel.  Now, you need to be absolutely firm.  Do *not* fall for appeals to ""work it out"" without concrete, measurable changes. 
* **No going back to the old pattern.**  This means *no* responding to emotional pleas, *no* accepting apologies without a real plan for change, and *no* offering reassurance if he’s not actively working to address the core issue (the distance/lack of presence).  This is the hardest part, but vital.
* **State your non-negotiables.** ""I need a partner who is actively present in my life. This requires more than a few visits every few months and daily texts. I need someone I can build a life with, not just talk about a life with.""  

**2. Prepare for the Anxiety & Depression – Proactive Self-Care:**

This is where you *anticipate* the feelings and create a plan to manage them.  Don't wait for the panic to hit.

* **Therapy:** Seriously, consider finding a therapist.  This is the *most* valuable tool.  A therapist can help you unpack the root of your fears, develop coping mechanisms for anxiety and depression, and build your self-esteem.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is particularly helpful for breaking negative thought patterns.
* **Support System:** Lean on friends and family *now*.  Talk to people you trust about what you're going through.  Don’t isolate.
* **Self-Soothing Activities:**  Make a list of things that genuinely bring you joy and relaxation. This could be anything: reading, exercise, spending time in nature, listening to music, taking a bath, cooking, painting, etc.  Schedule these into your routine *now*, not just when the breakup happens.

How do I decide if I should end my relationship with my boyfriend?,"That's a loaded question.  Typically, if we are contemplating if we should or not, it is for a reason.  To really come to a place of decision, you need to know where you are right now, what is not working, what the potential resolution would be and if it is realistic.  If you can answer those questions, you may gain some insight.   If it is realistic and your boyfriend is on the same page, seek help putting a plan in motion for resolution.  And I mention him being on the same page because if he is not, then it will never come to fruiting.  Without much other information, this is this is a solid approach.","Okay, this is a big one, and it's good you're taking the time to seriously consider it. It's rarely an easy decision. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, broken down into sections to help you think through it.  I'll cover self-reflection, evaluating the relationship, looking at patterns, and practical considerations.  This is long, but comprehensive.  I'll also add a disclaimer at the end.

**I. Self-Reflection: What Do *You* Need?**

Before you even start analyzing the relationship, you need to understand yourself.

*   **Your Core Values:** What are the non-negotiable things you need in life and in a partner? (Honesty, respect, ambition, family-orientation, kindness, adventure, etc.).  Is he consistently violating any of these?
*   **Your Needs:** What are your emotional, physical, intellectual, and social needs? Are they being met in this relationship?  (Think beyond just ""love"" - do you need quality time, words of affirmation, physical touch, help with chores, intellectual stimulation, etc.?)
*   **Your Happiness:**  Be brutally honest.  Are you genuinely happy *most* of the time when you're with him?  Or are you more often feeling drained, anxious, or resentful?  (Not every day is perfect, but the overall trend matters.)
*   **Your Future:**  What do you envision for your future (career, location, family, lifestyle)?  Does he fit into that vision?  Are your long-term goals compatible?  Can you realistically see building a life with him?
*   **Your Self-Worth:** Are you staying in this relationship because you believe you deserve better, or because you fear being alone?  Your worth isn't determined by being in a relationship.



**II. Evaluating the Relationship: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly**

Make a list (literally, on paper or in a document). Divide it into three columns:

*   **Things I Love/Appreciate:** What are the things he does that make you happy? What are his good qualities? What are the positive aspects of the relationship?  (Don't minimize these!)
*   **Things That Bother Me/Problems:** What are the recurring issues?  What things does he do (or *not* do) that consistently upset you? Be specific. (e.g., ""He doesn't listen when I talk about my day,"" not just ""He's dismissive."")
*   **Dealbreakers:** These are the things that, if they continue, make the relationship unsustainable *for you*. These are often related to your core values. (e.g., infidelity, abuse – physical, emotional, or financial, addiction, fundamentally different life goals, constant lying).

**Look closely at the lists.**

*   **Is the ""Good"" outweighing the ""Bad""?**  This isn't just about quantity, but *importance*. A few major positives might outweigh many minor negatives.
*   **How many things are in the ""Dealbreaker"" column?**  Even one dealbreaker is a huge issue.
*   **Are the problems fixable?**  (See section III)



**III.  Patterns and Attempts to Fix Things**

*   **Recurring Arguments:**  What do you fight about *over and over*?  If the same issues keep coming up, it suggests a deeper problem that isn't being addressed.
*   **Have You Tried to Fix Things?**  Have you clearly and calmly communicated your concerns to him?  Have you *both* been willing to work on solutions? (Couples counseling is a great option here, and doesn't mean you're admitting defeat.)
*   **His Response to Feedback:** This is crucial.  Does he:
    *   **Get defensive and blame you?** (Red flag)
    *   **Dismiss your feelings?** (Red flag)
    *   **Acknowledge your concerns and try to understand?** (Good sign)
    *   **Make promises to change but doesn't follow through?** (Common, and often a sign things won't improve)
    *    **Actually work *with* you to find solutions?** (Very good sign)
*   **How long have you been trying to fix things?**  Sometimes, you can work at something for a reasonable amount of time and still see no progress.  There's a point where continued effort becomes enabling.
* **Is there a pattern of unhealthy behavior?** This could be anything from controlling behavior to emotional withdrawal.




**IV. Practical Considerations (Don't Ignore These!)**

*   **Financial Entanglement:** Do you share finances (joint accounts, rent/mortgage,"
I don't know what to say. I have never really known who I am.,"The older I get, the more I believe that our real task isn't to 'find' ourselves. We're already 100% ""there."" What we do have to do is become more mindful of the times when we feel the most alive, most happy, most creative, and most fully engaged with life. It is in those moments that we find ourselves.For example, I couldn't help loving the people or things I loved, no matter who tried to talk me out of them. All I needed to do was notice when my heart opened and I felt the most alive--not because I was afraid or addicted, but because in those moments, I was in contact with my highest self. On the flip side, I needed to recognize the people and activities that consistently brought out the worst in me--the ones that made me feel controlled, constricted, dishonest, resentful, or afraid--and be honest about them. Mindfulness of ""what already is"" is the key to finding yourself. Align yourself with the people and activities that matter most to you. Don't let old habits, crappy jobs, or mean-spirited people define you. Just stumble your way forward as best you can, with greater self-awareness followed by affirmative action..   ","Okay. That's... a really big and important thing to admit. And it's *okay* to not know. It's actually far more common than people let on. So many people spend their lives figuring that out. You're not alone in feeling this way. It takes courage to even say those words, so I want to acknowledge that first.

It sounds like you're at a starting point, and while that can be unsettling, it's also full of possibility.  

Let's break this down a little. When you say you don't know who you are, what does that *feel* like? Is it:

* **A lack of interests?** Like nothing really excites you or holds your attention?
* **A feeling of being different from others?** Like you don't fit in or understand what motivates people around you?
* **A sense of emptiness or confusion about your values?**  Like you're not sure what's truly important to you?
* **Difficulty defining your personality?**  Do you feel like you change depending on who you're with, or you don't have a consistent sense of self?
* **Something else entirely?**

You don't have to pick one, and it's okay if it's a mix of things. Just trying to pinpoint *what* feels missing can be helpful.

Here are some thoughts and ideas, and I'll try to be as open-ended as possible.  I'll also offer some things you could *do*, but no pressure at all.  Just read what resonates:

**1. It's a Journey, Not a Destination:**  Finding out who you are isn't a single ""aha!"" moment. It's a process of exploration, experimentation, and self-discovery that can take a lifetime.  Be kind to yourself and accept that it's okay to evolve and change.

**2.  Separate ""Who You Are"" from ""What You Do"":**  We often define ourselves by our jobs, hobbies, or relationships.  But those are *things you do*, not necessarily *who you are* at your core.  What remains when all those things are stripped away? This is a really tough question, but a good one to ponder.

**3.  Explore Your Past (Gently):**  Think back to your childhood. What did you enjoy? What were you curious about? What felt natural to you, before the world started telling you what you *should* like?  There might be clues there.  Don't dwell on trauma or negative experiences right now; focus on the things that brought you joy or sparked your interest.

**4.  Experiment with New Things:** This is where the ""doing"" comes in.  Try things you've always been curious about, even if they seem small or silly.  Take a class, join a club, volunteer, read different genres of books, listen to new music.  You might discover hidden talents or passions.  Don't be afraid to be bad at something! The point is to *try*.

**5.  Pay Attention to Your Reactions:**  What makes you feel energized? What drains you? What makes you angry or passionate?  Your emotional responses can tell you a lot about your values and what's important to you.

**6.  Values Clarification:** What principles do you believe in?  Things like honesty, kindness, creativity, justice, adventure, security?  Identifying your core values can give you a compass to guide your decisions and actions. (There are lots of ""values clarification"" exercises online if you're interested - I can link some if you'd like.)

**7.  Self-Reflection:**  Journaling can be a really helpful tool.  Just write whatever comes to mind, without censoring yourself.  You can also try meditation or mindfulness exercises to become more aware of your thoughts and feelings.

**8.  Don't Compare Yourself to Others:** This is a big one. Everyone is on their own path.  What works for someone else might not work for you, and that's okay.  Focus on your own journey and what feels authentic to *you*.



**Most importantly:**

* **It's okay to ask for help.** Talking to a therapist, counselor, trusted friend, or family member can provide support and guidance.  (I can provide resources for finding mental health support if you'd like.)
* **Be patient with yourself.**  This is a process, and it takes time.
* **Self-discovery can be scary, but it's also incredibly rewarding.**



I'm here to listen if you want to talk more.  You can tell me anything, and I won't judge.  

Where do you want to start?  Maybe just by talking about what sparked this feeling"
"Whenever I run into a situation that makes me upset or angry, I tend to start cursing and badly offending the person I am confronting. I say mean things to let my anger out. Whenever people tell me stuff about my relationship (like starting rumors or saying negative things about me or my relationship) I lash out not just them but at my boyfriend. I feel like I keep causing drama due to my personality. I want to be a better person and learn to let things not get to me and be happy and graceful. I hurt the ones I love with my words. I want to be better for myself and them.","Congratulations on making your way to Step One, self-observation and deciding to change a feature about how you understand and relate to others.There is extraordinary strength in being willing to notice your effect on others and consider what changes are possible.Start on the inside track of your own heart and mind.  Once you're able to understand what is driving your emotions to the point where the only reasonable way of handling them is to curse and offend people, you'd have gotten a long way in knowing your own expectations of others and how far off the mark from this in your mind, they are.For example, if you expect others to always be accepting, tolerant and happy about situations with your boyfriend, and you're hearing otherwise from people, then you can prepare yourself for possible, less than positive comments about your relationship, or you can ask people to not comment to you about your relationship at all.Basically, the more you know about yourself and are willing to accept your right to ask others to respect your views, the easier and calmer time you'll have in handling comments from others that you're not glad hearing.Also, this is a long process because you'd be trying to change long time and deep patterns of interacting.Be patient with your own learning curve and certainly consider therapy for yourself in order to have some outside guidance and support for the process you're placing yourself.","Okay, this is incredibly self-aware and a *really* positive first step. Recognizing this pattern and wanting to change it is huge. You've identified a core issue and are motivated to work on it, which is fantastic. It takes courage to admit that, and you should be proud of yourself for that. Here's a breakdown of what's likely happening, and a bunch of strategies, broken down into sections, to help you move towards the more graceful, happy you that you envision.  It's going to take work, but it's absolutely achievable.

**1. Understanding What's Going On**

* **Emotional Flooding:** What you're describing sounds a lot like emotional flooding.  When you're intensely angry or upset, your brain's emotional center (the amygdala) basically takes over, and your rational thinking center (the prefrontal cortex) goes offline. This means you're reacting *from* a place of raw emotion, and your usual filters and self-control are diminished.  The cursing and hurtful words are the result of that flood.
* **Defense Mechanism:** Lashing out can be a defense mechanism. It's a (very unhealthy) way to try to regain control when you *feel* out of control.  It’s a way to push people away and protect yourself from further hurt, even though it ironically damages the relationships you care about.
* **Triggered Feelings:**  Rumors and negativity about your relationship are *especially* triggering. It sounds like it taps into insecurities, fears of betrayal, or a need to protect your partner and the relationship. You're likely feeling vulnerable and threatened, and the lashing out is a desperate attempt to control the situation or alleviate that feeling.
* **Learned Behavior (Possibly):**  Sometimes, we learn how to handle anger from our families or environments growing up.  If you witnessed similar reactions in your childhood, you might unconsciously be repeating that pattern.  (This doesn’t excuse it, but it can help you understand *why* it happens.)
* **Underlying Needs:** Anger is often a secondary emotion.  Underneath the anger, there's often sadness, fear, hurt, or frustration.  The lashing out is a way to express those deeper feelings, but in a very destructive way.



**2. Immediate Strategies (In the Moment)**

These are things to try *when* you feel the anger starting to rise.  They're about interrupting the cycle *before* the hurtful words come out.

* **The Pause:** This is the most important.  As soon as you feel your anger escalating, *physically pause*.  Stop talking.  Take a deep breath.  Count to five.  Anything to create a gap between the trigger and your reaction.  This is incredibly hard, but practice makes it easier.  Tell yourself, ""I need a moment.""
* **Deep Breathing:**  Specifically, box breathing. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds. Repeat several times.  This helps calm your nervous system.
* **Grounding Techniques:**  These help bring you back to the present moment.
    * **5-4-3-2-1:**  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.
    * **Feel Your Feet:**  Focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground.
* **Remove Yourself:**  If possible, physically remove yourself from the situation.  Say, ""I'm feeling overwhelmed, I need to step away for a few minutes.""  Go to another room, go for a walk, anything to create space.
* **Use ""I"" Statements:**  Instead of ""You always…!"" or ""You make me…!"", try ""I feel [emotion] when [situation] happens.""  For example, instead of ""You're so annoying when you talk about my relationship!"", try ""I feel hurt and frustrated when I hear negative comments about my relationship."" This takes practice.
* **Write it Down:** If you can’t leave the situation, discreetly jot down your feelings.  This can be a quick release valve.




**3. Longer-Term Strategies (Building Resilience & Changing Patterns)**

These are about addressing the underlying issues and developing healthier coping mechanisms.

* **Therapy:**  Seriously consider therapy.  A therapist can provide a safe space to explore your emotions, understand the root causes of your anger, and develop personalized strategies for managing it.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is particularly effective for this.
* **Identify Your Triggers:**  What specifically sets you off?  Is it criticism? Feeling controlled?  Being ignored?  Once you know your triggers, you"
